The story is told from the point of view of Ellen Bunting, a former maid, and her husband and former butler, Mr. Bunting, who together are trying to manage alodging. Struck by bad luck at their first attempt, as anepidemydevelops near where their first lodging is, they decide to try one more time, with their remaining savings. When they are close to giving up on this endeavour, and barely able even to buy food, Mr. Sleuth appears and decides to stay there. He pays a month upfront and asks not to be disturbed while conducting his experiments.

Mrs. Bunting likes Mr. Sleuth and his quiet ways, but becomes increasingly suspicious of him as he arrived on the same day that a gruesome murder happened, and, while he is staying there, several more women are killed by a mysterious man. She notices that the man only leaves after it is dark and his experiments consist of burning his clothes. However, she is horrified at her own suspicions, and does not want to think ill of Mr. Sleuth. She also fears that if her suspicions are true, she and her husband will be blamed for sheltering him, so, despite her growing fear, she lets him stay.

Mr. Bunting, having received some extra money after working as a waiter for an expensive party, invites his daughter from a previous marriage, Daisy, to visit them for a few days during her 18th birthday. That night, while going home, he finds Mr. Sleuth on his way to the lodging. After a brief conversation, he passes Mr. Sleuth to open the lodging's front door and accidentally touches Mr. Sleuth's pocket. The butler becomes suspicious after realizing it was drenched in blood, and even more so when two more bodies are found nearby the next morning.

On the day of Daisy's birthday, both Mr. and Mrs. Bunting leave the house at the same time. When they meet each other and realize they left Daisy alone with Mr. Sleuth, they run back and, arriving there, the girl tells them about the conversation she had with the lodger, during which he asked if he could go toMadame Tussaudswith Daisy and Ellen. While in the museum, they see the Head Commissioner of Police and other officers leaving. Believing he was betrayed by Mrs. Bunting, Mr. Sleuth threatens her and disappears, only for his body to be found five days later, having drowned in a river.

Although it is accepted that gender is an important aspect of Lowndes' work, the views are somewhat divided.[4]Virginia Macdonald, in theTwentieth century crime and mystery writerschapter about Lowndes, notices a pattern in Lowndes' stories of women who are turned from respectable to murderous due to vices or other psychological problems.[8]For Mary Jean DeMarr, the main thematic impulse ofThe Lodgeris Mrs. Bunting's "willful self-deception".[9]Scholars Laura Marcus and Joseph Kestner, both responsible for writing "full-length academic texts on Marie Belloc Lowndes," consider the British writer to be "decidedly feminist."[4]

According to literature professor Elyssa Warkentin, having the main female character be the one person capable of solving the mystery behind the murders that eluded thousands of officers and detectives, is a "suggestion that the problem of male violence cannot be solved within the confines of male-dominated systems of knowledge". For her, the novel gives agency to women in a situation of violence andmisogyny.[4]Marcus also comments, in one of her studies aboutThe Lodger, how Mrs. Bunting is "more of a detective figure than Joe, the police detective."[7]: 33

Warkentin, in her analysis, notes that, although the reader sees the perspective of several characters throughout the story, the one that is most prevalent is Mrs. Bunting's, who is also the first of them to realize that the new lodger might be the killer that theScotland Yardis after. Mrs. Bunting is also treated as an agent in the novel, instead of being an object or victim, which Marcus sees as a manifestation of Lowndes' feminism inThe Lodger.[4]

In an analysis of three of Lowndes' works, "focusing primarily on [...] novels about murderesses", Ellen Turner comments on how Mr. Sleuth, the murderer, isfeminisedby the author, being described as "a strange, queer looking figure of a man". For Turner, this shows that murder is strongly "associated with the feminine" in Lowndes' works.[10]: 56-57

When Mr. Sleuth first appears, the Buntings see in him their salvation from financial ruin. After some time, Mrs. Bunting becomes suspicious of her lodger, as she realizes he could be the one behind the murders. Even though she knows this, Mrs. Bunting avoids talking to the police, as she is afraid her association with the murderer could lead to being ostracized by society.[11]Not only that, throughout the novel she shows a constant fear of the police, who, for the Buntings, possess an almost unnatural power.[10]: 60

Even though Mrs. Bunting is portrayed as a "respectable, nineteenth century woman of her class," she is free of anyethical dilemmawhen she chooses to protect Mr. Sleuth from the police.[11]

The Lodgerwas initially published in 1911 as a short story in the last edition ofMcClure's Magazineaccompanied by sketches from Henry Raleigh.[3]: ix; xiiiAfterwards, Marie Belloc Lowndes wrote a novel by the same name, based on the short story, which was published in 1913 in a serialized format in theDaily Telegraph. Later in the same year, it was published byMethuenas a book.[3]: xiii

The Lodgeris considered to be both the first and the best fictional adaptation of the Jack the Ripper story.[11][4]According to Lowndes in one of her memoirs, the book had sold over a million copies after a few decades of its publication.[4]When originally released in the United States, writersErnest HemingwayandGertrude Steinhelped advertise it,[12]with Hemingway callingThe LodgerandThe Chink in the Armour"splendid after-work books, the people credible and the action and the terror never false."[7]: 23Edmund Pearson, a contemporary who also wrote books based on "true crimes", called Lowndes' book "the best novel about murder written by any living author."[5]

A review published inThe Observerin 1913 said "[Belloc Lowndes] brings to the making of a mystery a literary sense and an imagination that puts life into the tale and into the readers." They commented on the quality of the characters, calling them "real people", and also praised the atmosphere that Lowndes managed to create.[13]ANew York Timesreview commented that the book's clue about the murderer is "nothing more than a clever 'blind'" to the real mystery to be solved, which "testifies to the skill of Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes as a writer of mystery stories."[14]

Anthony Hilfer called it "[t]he classic novel of guilty bystanders" in his book,The Crime Novel: A Deviant Genre.[15]: 95Lowndes was later praised for how the story focuses not on the murderer or their targets, but instead on the people affected by them, such as the Bunting family.[11]

The Lodger, which has spawned several adaptations throughout the years, is considered today to be one of Lowndes' most widely known works.[16][11]But, despite the praise she received for the novel, very few academic studies were published about it until a more recent revival.[4][16]

The 1950surban legendThe Hookfollows the plot dynamics of the horror novelThe Lodger.[1]Though the two narratives have little in common, theliterary scholarChristopher Pittard notes that both are built upon a "threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product ofpostmodernistconsumer culture."[17]

The first adaptation of Belloc Lowndes novel was asilent moviedirected byAlfred Hitchcock,[18]which was also Hitchcock's first movie released to the general public.[19]: 202It was released in the United Kingdom in 1926 with the titleThe Lodger: A Story of the London Fog,[19]: 202and in the United States in the following year titledThe Case of Jonathan Drew.[20]

While the plot is very similar to the novel, Hitchcock had to change the script to have the Buntings' daughter, Daisy, as the lodger's love interest due to pressure from the studio.[19]: 182Another major change made at the request of the studio was having the lodger, played byIvor Novello, shown as innocent for all the deaths. While Hitchcock had originally planned to maintain the killer's identity a mystery, "a star of Novello's standing could not end up as a pathological killer." His character is instead searching for the killer.[19]: 194

In 1932, another movie based on the story, also starring Novello in the main role, was released. Directed byMaurice Elveyand titledThe Phantom Fiendin the United States, it was considered a closer adaptation to the original than that of Hitchcock.[21]In 1944another moviewas released, this time byJohn Brahm. This version differs from the original by having the lodger's victims as actresses instead of sex workers.[22]Hugo Fregonesedirected a 1953 adaptation ofThe LodgercalledMan in the Attic.[23]

The novel was also adapted to the television.Armchair Mystery Theatre, a companion show ofArmchair Theatre, had an episode in its third season called "The Lodger", which aired in 1965 in the United Kingdom.[24]In 1967,Wolf Dietrich[de]directed aTV moviein Germany calledDer MieterwithPinkas Braunas the murderer.[18][25]

In 2009 David Ondaatje directed a new adaptation calledThe Lodgerand starringAlfred Molina,Hope DavisandSimon Baker.

In 1940, Hitchcock andHerbert Marshallworked together to create a radio version of Belloc Lowndes' 1913 novel. This was the first episode of a new series calledSuspense, which was created to "bring 'something new and different to radio'."[26]Four years later, another episode ofSuspensebased on the book was broadcast, this time withRobert Montgomeryin the main role.[27]Montgomery reprised his performance in 1948, when the series broadcast a one-hour episode based onThe Lodger.[28][29]

In 1946,Ida LupinoandVincent Priceparticipated in aHollywood Star Timeepisode,[30]and in 1947Mystery in the Airbroadcast an episode starringPeter Lorre.[31]

BBC Radio 4released a new version adapted by Stephen Sheridan and produced by David Blount in 2003, which significantly changed the ending of the story.[32]

The novel was also adapted to theopera, with a production composed byPhyllis Tatewhich premiered in 1960.[33]
