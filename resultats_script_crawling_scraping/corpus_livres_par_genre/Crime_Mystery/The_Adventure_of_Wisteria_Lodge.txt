Sherlock Holmes is visited by John Scott Eccles, who wishes to discuss something "grotesque". No sooner has he arrived at221B Baker StreetthanInspector Gregsonalso shows up, along withInspector Baynesof theSurreyConstabulary. They wish a statement from Eccles about the murder of Aloysius Garcia nearEsherthe previous night.

Eccles explains that he spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia's rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared, leaving him alone in the house. Eccles mentions that a note, delivered during dinner the previous evening, had caused great consternation to Garcia and may have had some connection with the household's disappearance.

Holmes' investigation leads him to the Henderson household, whose master has spent time in thetropics, and whose secretary is a dark-skinned foreigner. Holmes believes that the cryptic note came from this household and the writer could only be the house's governess, Miss Burnet, who has not been seen since the night of the murder.

That night, the Hendersons flee by train. Miss Burnet escapes with the help of a former gardener. It is revealed that "Henderson" is in fact Don Juan Murillo, an overthrowndictatorfromCentral Americawho left a bloody trail behind as he escaped to England. Miss Burnet's real name is Mrs. Victor Durando. Her late husband was San Pedro's ambassador to Britain and a potential political rival to Murillo. Murillo had him recalled and shot so that he would not pose a threat to Murillo's position. Fortunately, Mrs. Durando stayed behind in England and avoided harm herself. She went on to change her name and secure the position as governess to Henderson's children in order to get closer to and spy on him.

Murillo and his secretary give thepolicethe slip in London, and resurface inMadridunder new aliases. However, they are both murdered, and their killers are never caught.
