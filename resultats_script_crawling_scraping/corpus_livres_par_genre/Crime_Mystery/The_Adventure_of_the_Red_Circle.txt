Mrs. Warren, a landlady, comes to221B Baker Streetwith some questions about her lodger. A youngish, heavily bearded man, who spoke good but accentedEnglish, came to her and offered double her usual rent on the condition that he get the room on his own terms. He went out the first night that he was there, and came back after midnight when the rest of the household had gone to bed. Since then, neither Mrs. Warren, her husband, nor their servant girl has seen him.

After the landlady leaves, Holmes remarks toDr. Watsonthat it seems likely that the person in Mrs. Warren's house is not the bearded man who made the arrangements. Holmes suspects that messages are being sent to the lodger.

Holmes and Watson go to Mrs. Warren's house and spy on the lodger, who they discover to be a young woman with a dark complexion. That evening, Holmes and Watson are on hand to see the lodger's confederate send messages by a waving candle.
