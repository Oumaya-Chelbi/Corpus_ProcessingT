The Mystery of a Hansom Cabtakes place inMelbourne, Australia, and involves an investigation into ahomicide, after a corpse is discovered in the early hours, in ahansom cab. Melbourne plays a significant role in the plot and, as the author describes, "Over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall."[13]The killer's identity is not as significant a revelation in the story as are the roles of the influential and secretive Frettlby family, and their secret: they have a daughter living on the streets, and the woman everyone assumes is their daughter is illegitimate. The class divide between Melbourne's wealthy and less fortunate is addressed throughout the plot.[14]
