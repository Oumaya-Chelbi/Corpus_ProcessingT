InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story "The Final Problem". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in "The Adventure of the Empty House" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, "The King of the Foxes".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a "monstrously evil man". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of "Love's Old Sweet Song", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]
