A young, upper-class English boy is kidnapped and sold by a beggar-woman to agypsy, who, not knowing his real name, names him Bob Singleton. She raises him until about the age of six when she is hanged. He is then raised as a ward of aparish, and sent to sea at age twelve, going on journeys toNewfoundland. In 1695, while returning from one of these journeys, he is captured byTurkishpirates and subsequently rescued by Portuguese sailors who carry him toLisbon. After a two-year stay there, he sails forBraziland later theEast Indies. Singleton becomes a thief under the influence of the Portuguese and harbours a desire to kill his master, who refuses to pay him wages and beats him. Nearly hanged for his part in an attemptedmutiny, Singleton, now about seventeen or eighteen, is set ashore with four companions on the coast ofMadagascar. A score of other sailors from the ship join them and together they endeavour to survive on the island, hunting wild animals and trading with the natives. Together they build a canoe and travel in it to the mainland where they decide to pursue a journey throughAfrica, from the coast ofMozambiqueto theGold Coast.

During the hazardous trip Singleton becomes the leader of the group. They enslave about sixty of the natives, one a prince, and procure some buffalo to transport their supplies. They heal the prince and make him commander over the rest. The travellers march through lands teeming withleopards,elephants,crocodiles, andsnakesand cross a great desert. The marchers meet an English merchant who has been living with the natives and who persuades Singleton and his companions to stop awhile in order to dig forgold. Having loaded themselves down with gold andelephant tusks, the adventurers finally reach a Dutch settlement, where they divide thespoilsand immediately go their separate ways.

Once Singleton has spent his fortune in England, he sets out again, this time for theWest Indieswhere he quickly takes to piracy. Singleton's abilities bring him high command, although his piratical activities encourage the growth of a callousness so pervasive that at times it leads to cruelty. There are chases andsea battlesin which Singleton proves himself an able, courageous, and imaginative leader. From the Indies the scene shifts to the East African coast and Madagascar where the pirates continue toplunderand sail restlessly in search of new conquests. This lust fornoveltytakes Singleton and his men into thePacificas far as thePhilippines, before returning to theIndian OceanandCeylon.

William, aQuakersurgeon, outwits a Ceylonese King and rescues a Dutch slave. William displays further resourcefulness by succeeding intradenegotiations with English merchants inIndia. He serves Singleton loyally and bravely as a kind ofman Friday: he is, moreover, aChristian humanistand healer who ultimately persuades his captain that a life of piracy leads nowhere. When Singleton contemplates suicide in the throes ofrepentance, William convinces him thatsuicideis the "Devil's Notion" and therefore must be ignored.

When they return to England, disguised asArmenians, they make the decision to stay together for the rest of their lives. Singleton marries William's sister, awidow, and the story ends on a note of domestic peace.[7][8]
