Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow, published in 1886, is a collection of humorous essays  byJerome K. Jerome. It was the author’s second published book and it helped establish him as a leading English humorist. While widely considered one of Jerome’s better works, and in spite of using the same style asThree Men in a Boat, it was never as popular as the latter. A second "Idle Thoughts" book,The Second Thoughts of An Idle Fellow, was published in 1898.
