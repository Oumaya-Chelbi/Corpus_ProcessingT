Aside from the example of contemporary misers,[16]Molière drew from a number of ancient and contemporary sources for elements in hisThe Miser. The character of Harpagon draws from theLatinplayAululariabyPlautusin which the miser Euclio incessantly changes the hiding place of his pot of gold out of fear of having it stolen, and the miser's fourth-act[b]monologue exaggerating the loss of his pot was the basis for  Harpagon's.  Also fromAululariaMolière appropriated the love affair between Élise and Valère, Harpagon's inspection of the hands of La Flèche, and Valère's avowals of love for Élise that Harpagon takes as his confession to theft.[17]La Belle Plaideuse(1655) ofFrançois le Métel de Boisrobertfurnished Molière with the father-as-usurer, and the scene in which a lender lends the borrower 15,000 francs, of which 3,000 is in goods;[18]several of these items appear in the list inThe Miser.[13]Jean Donneau de Visé'sla Mère coquette(1665) gave Molière a father and son in love with the same young woman.[citation needed]

Very soon after the play's first production in 1668, versions began to appear elsewhere in Europe. A German translation,Der Geizige, appeared in Frankfurt in 1670.[19]In EnglandThomas Shadwelladapted Molière's work under the title "The Miser" in 1672 and added eight new characters.[20]An even more popular version based on both Plautus and Molière was produced byHenry Fieldingin 1732.[21]

In Italiancommedia dell'artethere was already a tradition of depicting misers as the Pantaleone figure, who was represented as a rich and avaricious Venetian merchant.[22]However, Molière's play was eventually adapted to opera.Giovanni Bertati's libretto based on the play was set byPasquale AnfossiasL'avaroin 1775 and in 1776 it was  set again byGennaro Astarita. Giuseppe Palomba also wrote a libretto based on the work which was set byGiacomo Cordellain 1814. In Russia, too,Vasily Pashkevichbased his 18th century comic operaThe Miseron Molière's play. Another musical adaptation in Arabic was pioneered by the LebaneseMarun Al Naqqash(1817–55) asal-Bakhil. This was performed in Beirut in 1847.[23]

Jovan Sterija Popović, the founding father ofSerbiantheatre, based hisTvrdica(The Miser, 1837) on Molière's play. In this work, the Harpagon figure is represented as a small town Greek merchant.[24]

One reason for so many versions must be the acknowledged fact that Molière's humour does not translate well and requires more or less free adaptation to succeed.[25]The history ofDe Vrek, Taco de Beer's 1863 translation into Dutch provides another notable example. In 1878 he adapted this to Dutch contemporary life and an edition of that version found its way toIndonesia. There it was further adapted intoMalayasSi Bachiland given a contemporary Indonesian background. In 1941 this production in turn served as basis for Tamar Djaja's novel of the same title, by which time the story had become all but unrecognisable.[26]

The earliest American production of a play titledThe Miserwas of Fielding's version in the years following 1766.[27]ABroadwayproduction of a translation of Molière's play ran for only three nights at the Experimental Theatre in 1936[28]and there have been several revivals since in one version or another.

In 1954,The Laird o' Grippy, a free translation intoScotsbyRobert Kemp, was staged by theEdinburgh Gateway Company, withJohn Lauriein the leading role.[29]

An audio recording of the 1969Lincoln Centerproduction produced byJules Irvingand directed byCarl Weberwas released byCaedmon Records(TRS 338). This recording of the adaptation byRanjit Boltis available at theInternet Archive.[30]The play itself ran at theVivian Beaumont Theaterfor 52 performances.[31]

An Australian musical theatre adaptation with the nameMistress Moneypremiered in Sydney in 1960. It had book and lyrics by Eleanor Witcombe and John McKellar and music by Dot Mendoza.[32]

More recently in Britain, John Coutts' English-Scotsversion ofThe Miserwas performed in 2009 under the titleThe Auld Skinflint.[33]In 2012 the play was made into a Bollywood musical titledKanjoos The MiserbyHardeep Singh Kohliand Jatinder Verma and toured the UK.[34]
