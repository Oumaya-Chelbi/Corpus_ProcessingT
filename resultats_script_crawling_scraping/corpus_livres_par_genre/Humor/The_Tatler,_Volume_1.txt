The Tatlerwas a British literary and society journal begun byRichard Steelein 1709 and published for two years.  It represented a new approach to journalism, featuring cultivated essays on contemporary manners, and established the pattern that would be copied in such British classics asAddisonand Steele'sThe Spectator,Samuel Johnson'sThe RamblerandThe Idler, andGoldsmith'sCitizen of the World.The Tatlerwould also influence essayists as late asCharles LambandWilliam Hazlitt. Addison and Steele liquidatedThe Tatlerin order to make a fresh start with the similarSpectator, and the collected issues ofTatlerare usually published in the same volume as the collectedSpectator.
