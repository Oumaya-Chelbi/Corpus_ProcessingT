Swift's essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustainedironyin the history ofEnglish literature. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: "A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in africassee, or aragout."[1]

Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay whichlampoonthe then-influentialWilliam Pettyand thesocial engineeringpopular among followers ofFrancis Bacon. These lampoons includeappealing to the authorityof "a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London" and "the famousPsalmanazar, a native of the islandFormosa" (who had already confessed to not being from Formosa in 1706).

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting byparalipsis:

George Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target inA Modest Proposalwas not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.[3]Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.[4]A memorable example of these sorts of schemes "involved the idea of running the poor through ajoint-stock company".[4]In response, Swift'sModest Proposalwas "a burlesque of projects concerning the poor"[5]that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

Ian McBride argues that the point ofA Modest Proposalwas to "find a suitably decisive means of dehumanizing the settlers who had failed so comprehensively to meet their social responsibilities."[6]A Modest Proposalalso targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who "regard people as commodities".[7]In the piece, Swift adopts the "technique of a political arithmetician"[8]to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy.Edmund Wilsonargues that statistically "the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated toMarx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population".[8]Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that "springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake".[9]

Author Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a "trap"[10]to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, "details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.[11]Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create "two opposing points of view" that "alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way."[11]

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses "the vocabulary of animal husbandry"[12]to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn "people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound".[12]

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetoricianQuintilian).[13]The contrast between the "careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme" and "the ridiculousness of the proposal" create a situation in which the reader has "to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan".[13]

Scholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wroteA Modest Proposal.

James William Johnson argues thatA Modest Proposalwas largely influenced and inspired byTertullian'sApology: a satirical attack against earlyRoman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.[14]Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the worksA Modest ProposalandApology.[15]In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that "human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human".[14]Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.[14]In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic "justification by ownership" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the mistreatment of the poor in Ireland.[16]

It has also been argued thatA Modest Proposalwas, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essayThe Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Childrenby Swift's rivalDaniel Defoe.[17]

Bernard Mandeville'sModest Defence of Publick Stewsasked to introduce public and state-controlledbordellos. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and—while not being a completely satirical text—has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.[18][19]Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous forThe Fable of the Beesand deliberations on private vices and public benefits.

John Lockecommented: "Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power,that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them: If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto". (First Treatise, sec. 59).

Robert Phiddian's article "Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal" focuses on two aspects ofA Modest Proposal: the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that "there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody".[20]

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of "Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet", argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argued that an insufficient number of critics have taken the time to focus directly on mercantilism and theories of labour inGeorgian eraBritain. "If one regards theModest Proposalsimply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact".[21]

At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that "people are the riches of the nation", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.[22]Furthermore, "in themercantilistview no child was too young to go into industry". In those times, the "somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity".[20]

Louis A. Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to "become a source of wealth to the nation" or else they "must turn to begging and thievery".[23]This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, "Swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism."[24]

Landa presents Swift'sA Modest Proposalas a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that "people are the riches of a nation".[23]Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.[24]The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.[24]Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.[24]Landa argued that Swift was putting the onus "on England of vitiating the working of natural economic law in Ireland" by denying Irishmen "the same natural rights common to the rest of mankind."[24]

Swift's essay created a backlash within Georgian society after its publication. The work was aimed at the elite, and they responded in turn. Several prominent members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work.Lord Bathurst's letter (12 February 1729–30) intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:
