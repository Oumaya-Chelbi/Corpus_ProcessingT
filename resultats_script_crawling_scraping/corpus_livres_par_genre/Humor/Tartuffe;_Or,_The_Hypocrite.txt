Orgon's family is up in arms because Orgon and his mother have fallen under the influence of Tartuffe, a pious fraud (and a vagrant prior to Orgon's help).  Tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority, and Orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him.

Tartuffe's antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends; they detest him. Orgon raises the stakes when he announces that Tartuffe will marry Orgon's daughter Mariane (who is already engaged to Valère).  Mariane becomes very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply Tartuffe has embedded himself into the family.

In an effort to show Orgon how awful Tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap Tartuffe into confessing to Elmire (Orgon's wife) his desire for her. As a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, Orgon will throw Tartuffe out of the house. Indeed, Tartuffe does try to seduce Elmire, but their interview is interrupted when Orgon's son Damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce Tartuffe.

Tartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well.  When Orgon enters the room and Damis triumphantly tells him what happened, Tartuffe usesreverse psychologyand accuses himself of being the worst sinner:

Orgon is convinced that Damis was lying and banishes him from the house. Tartuffe even convinces Orgon to order that, to teach Damis a lesson, Tartuffe should be around Elmire more than ever. As a gift to Tartuffe and further punishment to Damis and the rest of his family, Orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to Tartuffe.

In a later scene, Elmire challenges Orgon to be witness to a meeting between her and Tartuffe. Orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that Elmire is wrong. He overhears Elmire resisting Tartuffe's very forward advances. When Tartuffe has incriminated himself definitively and is dangerously close to violating Elmire, Orgon comes out from under the table and orders Tartuffe out of his house. The wily guest means to stay, and Tartuffe finally shows his hand. It turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, Orgon had admitted to Tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). Tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells Orgon that he (Orgon) will be the one to leave. Tartuffe takes his temporary leave. Orgon's family tries to decide what to do. Very soon, Monsieur Loyal shows up with a message from Tartuffe and the court itself; they must exit the house because it now belongs to Tartuffe. Dorine makes fun of Monsieur Loyal's name, mocking his fake loyalty. Even Madame Pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about Tartuffe even in the face of her son's actually witnessing it, has become convinced of Tartuffe's duplicity.

No sooner does Monsieur Loyal leave than Valère rushes in with the news that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that Orgon is about to be arrested. Before Orgon can flee, Tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise, the officer arrests him instead. The officer explains that the enlightened KingLouis XIV—who is not mentioned by name—has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by Tartuffe's treachery towards Orgon, has ordered Tartuffe's arrest instead.

It is revealed that Tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. As a reward for Orgon's previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave Tartuffe possession of Orgon's house and possessions. The entire family is thankful that it has escaped the mortification of both Orgon's potential disgrace and their dispossession.

The drama ends well, and Orgon announces the upcoming wedding of Valère and Mariane. The surprisetwist ending, in which everything is set right by the unexpected benevolent intervention of the heretofore unseen king, is considered a notable modern-day example of the classical theatrical plot devicedeus ex machina.

ThoughTartuffewas received well by the public and even by Louis XIV, it immediately sparked conflict amongst many different groups who were offended by the play's portrayal of someone who was outwardly pious but fundamentally mercenary, lecherous, and deceitful; and who uses their profession of piety to prey on others. The factions opposed to Molière's work included part of the hierarchy of theFrench Roman Catholic Church, members of upper-class French society, and the illegal underground organization called theCompagnie du Saint-Sacrement.Tartuffe's popularity was cut short when thearchbishop of ParisPéréfixeissued an edict threatening excommunication for anyone who watched, performed in, or read the play. Molière attempted to assuage church officials by rewriting his play to seem more secular and less critical of religion, but the archbishop and other leading officials would not budge. The revised, second version of the play was calledL'Imposteurand had a main character named Panulphe instead of Tartuffe, the only performance of which occurred in the Palais-Royal theatre on 5 August 1667. Immediately the following day, on 6 August, as the king was away from Paris,Guillaume de Lamoignon, first president of theParis Parlement, censored public performances.[5]

Even throughout Molière's conflict with the church, Louis XIV continued to support the playwright; it is possible that without the King's support, Molière might have beenexcommunicated. Although public performances of the play were banned, private performances for the Frencharistocracydid occur.[6]In 1669, after Molière's detractors lost much of their influence, he was finally allowed to perform the final version of his play. However, due to all thecontroversysurroundingTartuffe, Molière mostly refrained from writing such incisive plays as this one again.[7]

An ally of Molière (believed by Robert McBride to beFrançois de La Mothe Le Vayer, but a hotly-debated point)[8][9]responded to criticism ofTartuffein 1667 with aLettre sur la comédie de l'Imposteur. The anonymous author sought to defend the play[a]to the public by describing the plot in detail and then rebutting two common arguments made for why the play was banned. The first being that theatrical works should not discuss religion at all; the second being that Tartuffe's actions on stage, followed by his pious speech, would make the audience think that they were to act as Tartuffe did. This section of letter contradicts the latter by describing how Tartuffe's actions are worthy ofridicule, in essence comic, and therefore by no means an endorsement.[citation needed]

Centuries later, when thesatiricalanticlericalmagazineLa Calottestarted publication in 1906, its first editorial asserted thatLaughter is the only weapon feared by the soldiers of Tartuffe; the new magazine proposed to effectively deploy that weapon, with articles and cartoons mercilessly lampooning the Catholic Church and its clergy.[11][12][13]

The original version of the play was in three acts and was first staged on 12 May 1664 at thePalace of Versailles' Cour de Marbre[14]as part offestivitiesknown asLes Plaisirs de l'île enchantée. Because of the attacks on the play and the ban that was placed on it, this version was never published, and no text has survived, giving rise to much speculation as to whether it was a work in progress or a finished piece. Many writers believe it consisted of the first three acts of the final version, whileJohn Cairncrosshas proposed that acts 1, 3, and 4 were performed.[15]Although the original version could not be played publicly, it could be given privately,[15]and it was seen on 25 September 1664 inVillers-Cotterêts, for Louis' brotherPhilippe I, Duke of Orléans, akaMonsieurand 29 November 1664 at theChâteau du Raincy, for the veteran of theFronde,Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti.[16]

The second version,L'Imposteur, was in five acts and performed only once, on 5 August 1667 in theThéâtre du Palais-Royal. On 11 August, before any additional performances, theArchbishop of ParisPéréfixe banned this version also. The largely-final, revised third version in five acts, under the titleTartuffe, ou L'Imposteur, appeared on 5 February 1669 at the Palais-Royal theatre and was highly successful.[15]This version was published[17]and is the one that is generally performed today.[15]

Since Molière's time,Tartuffehas stayed on the repertoire of theComédie-Française, where it is its most performed play.[18]
