The Comic History of Rome[1](1851) is a humorous look at the people and events ofancient Romefrom its Foundation to theAssassination of Julius Caesar. It was published byBradbury and Evans, with text by the English humoristGilbert Abbott à Beckettand comic illustrations byJohn Leech, famous for his illustrations for the novellaA Christmas Carol(1843) byCharles Dickens. In his introduction, à Beckett wrote that, "The writer of this book is animated by an earnest wish to aid, as far as he is able, in the project of combining instruction with amusement." Largely, however, to modern eyes the humour lies not in à Beckett's somewhat dated text but rather in Leech's illustrations, which, with their top-hat and toga wearing patricians directly lampoon Victorian society.[2]
