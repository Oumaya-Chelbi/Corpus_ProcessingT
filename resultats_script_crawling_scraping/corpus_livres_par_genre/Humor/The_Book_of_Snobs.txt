The Book of Snobsis a collection ofsatiricalworks byWilliam Makepeace Thackeraypublished in book form in 1848, the same year as his more famousVanity Fair. The pieces first appeared in fifty-three weekly pieces from February 28, 1846 to February 27, 1847, as "The Snobs of England, by one of themselves", in the satirical magazinePunch. The pieces, which were immensely popular and thrust Thackeray into widespread public view, were "rigorously revised" before their collection in book form and omitted the numbers which dealt with then current political issues (numbers 17â€“23).[1]
