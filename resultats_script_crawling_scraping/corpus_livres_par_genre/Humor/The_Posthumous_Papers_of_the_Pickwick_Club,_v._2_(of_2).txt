The Pickwick Papersis a sequence of loosely related adventures written for serialization in a periodical. The action is given as occurring 1827–28, though critics have noted some seeming anachronisms.[7]For example, Dickens satirized thecaseofGeorge NortonsuingLord Melbournein 1836.[8]

The novel's protagonistSamuel Pickwick, Esquire is a kind and wealthy old gentleman, the founder and perpetual president of the Pickwick Club. He suggests that he and three other "Pickwickians" should make journeys to places remote from London and report on their findings to the other members of the club. Their travels throughout the English countryside by coach provide the chief subject matter of the novel.[9]A romantic misunderstanding with hislandlady, the widowMrs Bardell, results in one of the most famous legal cases in English literature,Bardell v. Pickwick,[10][11]leading to them both being incarcerated in theFleet Prisonfor debt.[12]

Pickwick learns that the only way he can relieve the suffering of Mrs Bardell is by paying her costs in the action against himself, thus at the same time releasing himself from the prison.[7][13]

Pickwick, Sam Weller, and his father Tony briefly reappeared in 1840 in the magazineMaster Humphrey's Clock. Master Humphrey's Clock is the name of a literary club founded by Mr Humphrey, whose members read out stories to the others.[14]Pickwick is a member, and there is a mirror club in the kitchen, Mr. Weller's Watch, run by Sam Weller.

The novel has been adapted to film, television, and radio:

In 1977,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Barry Campbell andConstance CoxwithFreddie Jonesas Mr. Pickwick.[18]In 1997,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Martyn Read withClive Francisas Mr. Pickwick.[19]

There was an early attempt at a theatrical adaptation with songs byW. T. Moncrieffand entitledSamuel Weller, or, The Pickwickians, in 1837. This was followed in 1871 byJohn Hollingshead's stage playBardell versus Pickwick. The first successful musical wasPickwick(sometimesPickwick, A Dramatic Cantata) bySir Francis BurnandandEdward Solomonand premiered at the Comedy Theatre on 7 February 1889.[20]

PickwickbyCyril Ornadel,Wolf Mankowitz, andLeslie Bricussewas a musical version which premiered inManchesterin 1963 before transferring to theWest End. It originally starredHarry Secombe(later cast as "Mr. Bumble" in the film version ofOliver!) in the title role andRoy Castleas "Sam Weller". Although it was a major success in London, running for 694 performances,Pickwickfailed in the United States when it opened onBroadwayin 1965. In 1969, theBBCfilmed the musical as the TV moviePickwickwith Secombe and Castle reprising their stage roles. Both the stage and TV versions featured the songIf I Ruled the World, which became a hit for Secombe and other singers such asTony BennettandSammy Davis Jr.

Part ofThe Pickwick Paperswere featured inCharles Dickens' Ghost Stories, a 60-minute animation made by Emerald City Films (1987). These includedThe Ghost in the Wardrobe,The Mail Coach Ghosts, andThe Goblin and the Gravedigger.

Stephen Jarvis's novelDeath and Mr Pickwick[21](2014) is in part a literary thriller, examining in forensic detail the question of whether the idea, character and physiognomy of Samuel Pickwick originated with Dickens, or with the original illustrator and instigator of the project, Robert Seymour. The conclusion of the narrator is that the accepted version of events given by Dickens and the publisherEdward Chapmanis untrue.

The novel was published in 19 issues over 20 months; the last was double-length and cost twoshillings. In mourning for his sister-in-lawMary Hogarth, Dickens missed a deadline and consequently, there was no number issued in May 1837. Numbers were typically issued on the last day of its given month:

Dickens drew on places that he knew from his childhood. He located the duel between Mr. Winkle and Dr. Slammer atFort Pitt, Chatham,[22]close to Ordnance Terrace where he had lived as a boy between 1817 and 1821.[23]

The popularity ofThe Pickwick Papersspawned many imitations and sequels in print, as well as actual clubs and societies inspired by the club in the novel. One example still in operation is the Pickwick Bicycle Club of London, established in 1870, the year of Charles Dickens's death.[24]The Dickens Pickwick Club was founded in 1976 byCedric Dickens, the author's great-grandson. Other clubs, groups, and societies operating under the name "The Pickwick Club" have existed since the original publication of the story.

In 1837, Dickens wrote to William Howison about the Edinburgh Pickwick Club. Dickens approved of the use of the name and the celebration of the characters and spirit of the novel. He wrote:

Other clubs include one meeting as early as December 1836 in the East of London and another meeting at the Sun Tavern inLong Acrein London. Dickens wrote to the secretary of the latter club in 1838 about attending a meeting:

In many Pickwick Clubs, members can take on the names of the characters in the novel. The website for the Pickwick Bicycle Club states: "Our rules state that 'Each Member shall adopt the sobriquet allocated by the Management Committee, being the name of some male character in the Pickwick Papers, and be addressed as such at all meetings of the Club'."[27]

A French translation byEugénie Niboyetappeared in 1838 in a two-volume edition. It was entitledLe Club des Pickwistes, roman comique. Later French translations have used titles such asAventures de Monsieur Pickwick.

Benito Pérez GaldóspublishedAventuras de Pickwick, a Spanish translation of thePickwick Papers, in 1868. Although Pérez Galdós was not born until after the publication of Dickens' first novel, he is sometimes described as the Spanish equivalent of Dickens.[28]
