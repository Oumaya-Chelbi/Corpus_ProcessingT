The four of them find themselves together on a White Starocean linercalled theAtlantic, sailing for England. Also on board is a capable young woman, Jane Hubbard, who is in love with Eustace. Wodehousian funny stuff ensues, with happy endings for all except Bream Mortimer.

Afilm adaptationwas made in 1962, starringNorman Wisdomas Sam Marlowe,Richard Briersas Eustace Hignett,Philip Lockeas Bream Mortimer, andMillicent Martinas Billie Bennett.  It was directed byHenry Kaplan. The screenplay was adapted from Wodehouse's novel byReuben Ship.

Some scenes from the novel (e.g., Sam Marlowe'sblackfaceperformance at the ship's concert) were not included in the film. The romance between Eustace and Jane Hubbard (played bySheila Hancock) was also altered; Eustace stands up to his domineering mother in the film but not in the book.
