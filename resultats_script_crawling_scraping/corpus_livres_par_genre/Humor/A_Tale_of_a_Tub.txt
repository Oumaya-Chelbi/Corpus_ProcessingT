A Tale of a Tubwas the first major work written byJonathan Swift, composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704. TheTaleis aproseparodydivided into sections of "digression" and a "tale" of three brothers, each representing one of the main branches ofwestern Christianityfrom the 17th-century English perspective. A satire on the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches andEnglish Dissenters, it was famously attacked for its profanity and irreligion, starting withWilliam Wotton, who wrote that it made a game of "God and Religion, Truth and Moral Honesty, Learning and Industry" to show "at the bottom [the author's] contemptible Opinion of every Thing which is called Christianity."[1]The work continued to be regarded as an attack on religion well into the nineteenth century.[2][3]One commentator complained that Swift must be "a compulsive cruiser of Dunghils â€¦ Ditches, and Common-Shores with a great Affectation [sic] for every thing that is nasty. When he spies any Objects that another Person would avoid looking on, that he Embraces".[4]
