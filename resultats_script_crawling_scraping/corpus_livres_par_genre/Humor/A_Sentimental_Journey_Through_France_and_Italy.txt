Yorick's journey starts inCalais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes as a gesture of friendship. He sees a woman, Madame L—, and is intrigued by her; he will continue to encounter her throughout the novel. Yorick buys achaiseto continue his journey. Yorick then inserts aprefacecataloguing different kinds of travellers.

After some time in Calais, the next town he visits isMontreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur. Along the way, they pass a man mourning for his deadass; Yorick sympathizes with him, but his sympathy is interrupted by his carriage driving away too quickly. They travel throughNampontandAmiensbefore arriving in Paris.

In Paris, he is distracted by the beauty of a shop girl (grisette) when he asks her for directions to theOpera Comique. After the opera, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France, he risks imprisonment in theBastille. He sees astarlingin a cage, which seems to be repeating the phrase "I can't get out"; he is unable to free it and, dwelling on its captivity, becomes miserable imagining the suffering of a prisoner in the Bastille.

Yorick travels toVersaillesto acquire a passport, and visits the Count de B****. When Yorick notices the count readsHamlet, he points with his finger atYorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king'sjesterand quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.

Yorick returns to Paris and stays a few more days before continuing his voyage to Italy. He visits Maria—who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel,Tristram Shandy—inMoulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.

After having passedLyonduring his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. The novel ends abruptly in the middle of a scene, with adouble entendre.

A Sentimental Journeywas partly written in response to the declining public opinion of Sterne's previous novel,Tristram Shandy, which he had been publishing in instalments since 1762.Tristram Shandywas primarily a comic novel, with some passages of moral sentiments. It was most praised for its sentimentality, with some reviewers suggesting that Sterne was better at writingpathosthan humour.[1]As the 1760s went on, the general literary taste also grew more disapproving of lewd content, contributing to the declining appreciation for (and sales of)Tristram Shandy's ongoing instalments.[2]In 1765,Ralph Griffithsreviewed the latest volumes ofTristram Shandyby saying that the public was no longer interested in that novel, directly advising Sterne to begin a new one focused on sentimentality. Griffiths later took credit for the publication ofA Sentimental Journey, which he praised.[3]

Concurrently with writingTristram Shandy, Sterne travelled to Paris in January 1762, before theSeven Years' Warended.[4]He visited France until 1764, followed by a trip through France and Italy from 1765 to 1766.[5]These travels inspired a parodic account of theGrand Tourin volume 7 ofTristram Shandyin 1765.[6]Still inspired, he decided to write a new book which would experiment with the genre of thetravel narrative, and revive his literary reputation after the declining sales ofTristram Shandy.[6]

Sterne first mentioned his plans for a new project in the summer of 1766, when he wrote that he would start a new travel-oriented four-volume work after he had finished the ninth volume ofTristram Shandy.[7]That ninth volume was published in January 1767,[8]and he wrote again about his ideas for a travel narrative in a letter to his daughter in February of 1767.[6]Sterne was very ill that spring, but better in the summer.[7]By June 1767, he was working seriously on the novel, with particular efforts in November and December.[6]His illness grew severe again in December.[7]During the process of composition, Sterne frequently exchanged passionate letters with a married woman,Elizabeth Draper. These letters commented on and influenced his novel-writing, and both express intense, frustrated desire.[9]He signed all his letters to her as "Yorick".[6]The letters were later published asLetters from Yorick to Elizain 1773, and more of his correspondence asJournal to Elizain 1904.[6]

In January 1768, the writing was complete for the first two volumes, and Sterne travelled to London to monitor the printing process.[10]The first two volumes ofA Sentimental Journeywere published on February 27, 1768.[6]The publication of the book was partly funded throughsubscriptionsand begins with a list of the subscribers' names.[11]Notable subscribers include theArchbishop of Yorkand theMarquis of Rockingham, as well as the famous actorDavid Garrick.[12]Elizabeth Draper subscribed under the pseudonym "Sterne's Eliza", purchasing three copies.[12]Subscribers had the option of receiving their copy printed on higher-quality paper.[12]The book ends with atipped-in pagepromising subscribers that they will receive the final two volumes the next winter.[11]However, only the first two were published due to Sterne's death in March.[9]

The book went through dozens of editions in the late eighteenth century, indicating substantial sales.[13]The second edition appeared on March 29, 1768—barely a month after the first edition and eleven days after Sterne's death.[14]A Sentimental Journeywas rapidly and widely translated on its publication. German and French editions appeared the same year as the English, and by the early 1800s it had been translated into seven other European languages.[9]It was soon published with a variety of annotated critical editions, starting with a 1782 edition which provided a French glossary.[13]It also appeared in pocket-sized editions to be carried on readers' travels.[13]At least fourteen illustrated editions were published between 1768 and 1810, with different illustrators.[15]Later editions include illustrations byThomas Heath Robinson(1869–1954),Vera Willoughby(1870–1939),Gwen Raverat(1885–1957), andBrian Robb(1913–1979).[16]

The language ofA Sentimental Journeyis playful, with an interest in puns, especially sexualdouble entendres.[9]The final line of the novel — which suggests grabbing a woman's "end" through the well-timed paratextual note indicating the end of the volume — illustrates the linguistic and metatextual playfulness of the book, and its allusive approach to sexuality.[10]Throughaposiopesis, Sterne often abandons a sentence or a narrative at a key moment, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks as to what should follow.[17]The novel is particularly likely to leave an obvious blank, with a word or phrase censored through asterisks or dashes, when the topic is sex or death.[18]

Structurally, the novel ispicaresquein its meandering series of disconnected adventures on the road.[6]It is alsoquixoticin its hero's over-attachment to a misguided ideal.[6]The novel moves betweentableaux-like scenes with little information about the links between them, often omitting explanations of how Yorick actually travelled along his journey.[9]

At its publication,A Sentimental Journeywas reviewed as atravel narrativerather than anovel, and well-received in reviews for its fresh contributions to that genre.[9]In the 1760s,travel writingwas a popular literary genre, more respected than the novel.[19]Travel writing was also undergoing a popularizing shift, as older travel narratives likeJoseph Addison'sRemarks on several parts of Italy, &c.were regarded as overly focused onclassicalscholarship, which was uninteresting and inaccessible to middle-class audiences.[6]Travel narratives were rarely written by the small elite of aristocratic young men who went on a formalGrand Tour; instead, they were written by more middle-class travellers, whose journeys might have practical motivation.[6]To better entertain their readers, travel writers began to emphasize personal anecdotes over scholarship or practical guidebook catalogues, and each writer sought to cultivate a distinctive narrative voice.[6]Many stylistic aspects ofA Sentimental Journeytake these trends to their logical extreme.[6]In bothTristram ShandyandA Sentimental Journey, Sterne promotes the idea that travel (and travel writing) should prioritize social connection rather than formulaic sight-seeing.[10]A Sentimental Journeycan also be seen as an answer toTobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimentalTravels Through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modelled the character ofSmelfunguson Smollett.[20]

A structural feature taken from travel writing is the organization of the work into chapters named after the characters' location, rather than numbered sequentially.[21]A new chapter begins each time there is a change of scenery, even if Yorick remains in the same city, such that the chapters describe the boundaries of individual narrativetableaux.[21]Reinforcing this connection, the chapter titles usually add a short description of the key event in the scene.[21]A 1768 review in theCritical Reviewdescribes the use of "whimsical titles" for the chapters as an "imitation of some celebrated authors".[22]

A Sentimental Journeydescribes locations Sterne visited on his own travels,[6]but the title page ofA Sentimental Journeyidentifies the narrative as "by Mr. Yorick."[23]InTristram Shandy, Parson Yorick is a minor character with a melodramatically tragic story: he is rejected by the church for his sense of humour, and dies in poverty. The novel mourns him by presenting his epitaph ("Alas, poor YORICK!") and printing a page of solid black.[24]Parson Yorick's unsuccessful clerical career mirrored Sterne's provincial obscurity as a clergyman beforeTristram Shandy, and Sterne was often publicly identified with Yorick.[25]Sterne published a collection of his own sermons under the titleThe Sermons of Mr. Yorick, with two volumes in 1760 and two more in 1766.[2]PublishingA Sentimental Journeyunder Yorick's name primed readers to expect the character's lighthearted but fundamentally moral perspective.[10]It also encouraged them to see Sterne himself as more like Yorick than the morally-questionable character of Tristram Shandy, which would improve Sterne's shaky reputation.[10]

AlthoughA Sentimental Journeywas considered less lewd than Sterne's previous novel, it is still characterized by frequent sexualized wordplay and events.[9]The novel does not treat sexual desire as incompatible with spiritual faith or moral goodness; instead, it suggests that desire is one way of encouraging people toward thepro-socialqualities of friendliness and generosity.[9][26]Several of Sterne's sermons present the idea that desire is granted to people by God, and that properly-directed desire promotes social harmony.[10]One of these sermons, "The Levite and his Concubine", is directly reworked inA Sentimental Journey.[10]

The interconnectedness of sympathy, sexual desire, and spirituality is particularly seen in Yorick's meeting with the peasant Maria.[27]Yorick seeks out the young and attractive Maria while she is alone in the countryside, mourning her lost husband; he finds her in tears, and is moved to tears himself. He uses his handkerchief to dry her eyes, and then his own, and then hers, and then his. In this moment, he "felt such undescribable emotions within" that he writes, "I am positive I have a soul," rejecting thematerialistview that sees all human behaviour as "combinations of matter and motion."[23]This scene is often seen as sexually suggestive, particularly in Yorick's 'undescribable emotions'.[10]The scene is also sometimes seen as hyperbolic, calling Yorick's leap of logic into question.[10]However, in the context of eighteenth-century philosophic discourses, both tears and sexual desire can be understood as proof of an immaterial soul, because emotion is also immaterial.[28]

Sterne often presented the novel as one with a serious moral purpose, calling it his "Work of Redemption", and writing to a friend that the book would "teach us to love the world and our fellow creatures better than we do."[13]However, even in Sterne's day, readers have questioned the moral value of sentimental emotion.[29]Eighteenth-century sceptics of the sentimental movement particularly criticized the shallowness of moments where Yorick expresses emotion but takes no action.[30]In 1789,A Sentimental Journeywas parodied by the anonymous novelA Man of Failing, which also targetedHenry Mackenzie'sThe Man of Feeling.[31]

Several twentieth-century scholars have argued that Yorick's feelings and religious expressions are intentionally excessive, and that he ought to be read as anunreliable narrator.[32]In this reading, the novel constitutes a critique of sentimentalists like Yorick who express ostentatious feelings of sympathy without concretely assisting those in distress.[33]One scholar, Rufus Putney, describes the novel as "a hoax by which Sterne persuaded his contemporaries that the humor he wanted to write was the pathos they wanted to read."[7]Thomas Keymerargues inThe Cambridge Companion to Laurence Sternethat the novel is best understood as offering the reader both options, serious or satirical, depending on their tastes.[34]

Sterne's observations about French society were markedly lessxenophobicthan many English travel writers at the time. The war between France and Britain often prompted patriotic and nationalistic discourses about Britain's superiority. It was also conventional for the travel writer to comment on their homesickness for their home country as the best country, which Yorick entirely avoids doing.[6][9]

One indication that Sterne's attitude to France was more generous than that of his audience lies in the annotations of an unknown eighteenth-century reader. This reader added comments in the margins of their copy of the first edition, expressing their conviction that France was naturally plagued with poverty due to its absolutist and Catholic government. For example, when Yorick is in Paris this reader's annotations contrast Paris and London, "one a place of total gaiety & dissipation the other of industry & business".[35]

At the novel's publication in 1768, reviewers consideredA Sentimental Journeyto be an improvement over the recent volumes ofTristram Shandy, and praised Sterne's change of focus from humour to sentimentality.[13]Eighteenth-century readers also preferred it because it was less obviously sexual.[9]The Monthly Reviewreferred to it as his "best production", and said, "the highest excellence of this genuine, this legitimate son of humour, lies not in his humorous but in hispatheticvein."[10]The Political Registerwrote, "Justly esteemed the best of the late Mr. Sterne's ingenious performances. To that original vein of humour which was so natural to him ... he has here added the moral and the pathetic; so that even while he is entertaining (as he always is) we are agreeably instructed."[22]Reflecting this general taste, the authorHorace Walpoledescribed it as "infinitely preferable to his tiresomeTristram Shandy" due to its "great good nature and delicacy," which appeals better to the "heart of sensibility."[13]More negative wasThe Critical Review, which complains that the book is "calculated to instruct young travellers in what the author meant for thebon tonof pleasure and licentiousness."[22]

A Sentimental Journeycontinued to be considered Sterne's best and most beloved work from Sterne's death through the early nineteenth century, and it was more widely reprinted thanTristram Shandy.[36]Its positive reputation was particularly promoted by the volume of extracts,The Beauties of Sterne, which was compiled by the print seller and publisherWilliam Hollandin 1782. This anthology included many passages praised for their emotional power.The Beauties of Sternewent through twelve editions in ten years.[36]

In addition to the professional commentary of reviewers, the eighteenth-century response to the novel can also be found in an annotated first edition ofA Sentimental Journey.[35]This unknown reader wrote their assessment at the bottom of the first page of the novel: "Stern was certainly a most elastic genious, by his sudden trancisions from one extreme to the other, not allways to his advantage, from starts or sally's most sublime and elevated down to the most gross and beastly unpardonably as if he feard to be to highly admired."[35]They object to the sentimental scene of the dead ass as "forced & unnatural", and they censor many of the novel's lewdest jokes.[35]To express their disapproval of the chapters "The Rose" and "The Passport", they initially glued several pages together to render them unreadable, then pried them open and blacked out the objectionable paragraphs line by line.[35]

By the mid-nineteenth century, the novel's reception grew more mixed, as Victorian readers were less tolerant of its 'indecencies'.[9]In 1819, the novel was added tothe Vatican's list of books prohibited by the Catholic Church.[13]The novelistWilliam Makepeace Thackerayinfluentially criticized its "corruption" in his 1852 public lectures, though some of his contemporaries resisted this assessment.[9][13]The literary criticLeslie Stephenalso objected to Sterne'sdouble entendres.[9]Despite these criticisms,A Sentimental Journeyhas never beenout of printsince its publication.[16]

In the early twentieth century, a new biography of Sterne and a decline in social conservatism prompted a re-evaluation of the novel.[13]It was particularly popular in the 1920s, when more than a dozen new editions were published.[13]Virginia Woolf, amodernistwriter, promoted a rejection of Victorian mores through her highly admiring introduction to a 1928 edition of the novel.[9]As others followed suit in embracing Sterne's proto-modernist experimentation with form,A Sentimental Journeywas often overshadowed byTristram Shandy, which attracted more scholarly attention for its more daring experiments inliterary form.[9]The firstscholarly monographaboutA Sentimental Journeywas W.B.C. Watkins'Perilous Balancein 1939.[13]Scholarship on the novel began to flourish in the 1960s and 70s.[13]Today,A Sentimental Journeyis studied for its role in the broader phenomenon of eighteenth centurysensibility.[9][13]

A Sentimental Journeyinspired a large number of illustrations, in the form of paintings, prints for sale, and decorated merchandise. Images of "Poor Maria" were particularly popular.[9][37]Angelica Kauffmann, an artist primarily known for herhistory paintings, paintedPoor Mariain 1777,[38]and printed copies were sold throughout Europe.[39][37]The porcelain companyWedgwoodcreated cameos of a similar "Poor Maria" image (and its companion shepherd portrait, the "Bourbonnais Shepherd") to decorate a wide range of products.[9][37]This best-selling motif appeared on personal adornments like brooches and shoe buckles, as well as household goods like teaware and vases.[9][37]In a portrait painted byÉlisabeth Vigée Le Brunin 1789, the Duchess of Orléans,Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, is depicted wearing a "Poor Maria" Wedgwood brooch at her waist.[37]The design was used onjasperwarebud vases as late as the 1960s.[40]

Other popular scenes for illustration were Yorick and thegrisette, the captive he imagines in the Bastille,[9]the old man and the ass, and the monk of Calais.[16]The monk formed the subject of the first painting based onA Sentimental Journey, exhibited in 1771.[16]Joseph Wright of Derby, best known for his images of theEnlightenmentsuch asA Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery,[41]made four paintings inspired by the novel: one version ofThe Captivein 1774, anotherCaptiveand a portrait of Maria in 1777, and a second portrait of Maria in 1781.[9]
