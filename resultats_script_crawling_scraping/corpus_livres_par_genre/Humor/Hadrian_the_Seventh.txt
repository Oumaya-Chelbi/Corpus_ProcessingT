The prologue introduces us to George Arthur Rose (a transparent doublefor Rolfe himself): a failed candidate for thepriesthooddenied his vocation by the machinations and bungling of theRoman Catholicecclesiastical machinery, and now living alone with his little yellow cat.

Rose is visited by two prominent churchmen, one aCardinal Archbishop. The two propose to right the wrongs done to him, ordain him a priest, and take him toRomewhere the Conclave to elect the new Pope has reached deadlock. When he arrives in Rome he finds that the Cardinals have been inspired toelect himas Pope. He accepts, and since the only previous English Pope wasAdrian (or Hadrian) IV, he takes the name Hadrian VII.

The novel develops with this unconventional, chain-smoking Englishman peremptorily reforming the Church and the early 20th-century world, against inevitable opposition from the established Roman Catholichierarchy, rewarding his friends and trouncing his enemies; generally he gets his way by charm or doggedness. His short reign is brought to an end when he is assassinated by aScotsman, or possibly anUlsterman, and the world breathes a sigh of relief.

In 1908 Rolfe resurrected the character of Hadrian forThe Bull Against the Enemy of the Anglican Race, a violent attack onLord Northcliffeand his newspaper, theDaily Mail, cast in the form of aPapal Bullissued by Hadrian VII.

The novel was made into a successful stage-play byPeter Luke, opening at theMermaid Theatre, London in April 1968 and starringAlec McCowenas Fr. William Rolfe (not Rose).  The subsequent Broadway production at theold Helen Hayes Theatrestarred first McCowen, thenRoderick Cook, and later,Barry Morse.  It was also Morse who played in an Australian production and a USA national tour.[citation needed]In 1972, the play was also staged at theVancouver Playhouse.[2]

A satirical novel on a similar theme, which mentionsHadrian the Seventhin its bibliography, isRobert Player'sLet's Talk of Graves, of Worms, of Epitaphs(1972).

The Translation of Father Torturo(2005), a novel byBrendan Connellabout a priest's ruthless ascent to the papacy, is dedicated to "Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe, Baron Corvo", "for the design which I so meanly twisted".

In 2014,The GuardianplacedHadrian the Seventhon its list of the 100 best novels written in English.Robert McCrumcalled it "entertaining if contrived [â€¦]orchidaceous, eccentric and weirdly obsessive, some would say mad."[3]
