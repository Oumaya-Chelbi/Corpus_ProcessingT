Alfred Salteena, an "elderly man of 42", has invited 17-year-old Ethel Monticue to stay with him. They receive an invitation to visit Alfred's friend, Bernard Clark, which they readily accept. Bernard is "inclined to be rich". Shortly after their arrival, Ethel and Bernard become attracted to each other.

Alfred seeks Bernard's advice on how to become agentleman. Bernard is doubtful that this can be managed, but writes an introduction to his friend the Earl of Clincham. Alfred excitedly rushes off to London to visit the Earl, leaving Ethel alone and unchaperoned with Bernard.

Lord Clincham lives, as many other aristocrats do, in "compartements" at theCrystal Palace. He agrees to assist Alfred and instals him in a subterranean "compartement", along with other "apprentice gentlemen". He invites Alfred to accompany him to a reception hosted by thePrince of Wales(the futureKing Edward VII), introducing Salteena as Lord Hyssops. The Prince is impressed, and promises to assist the trembling and overjoyed Salteena.

Bernard and Ethel fall in love and marry. Devastated by these events, Salteena marries a maid-in-waiting at Buckingham Palace. Lord Clincham also marries, but not very happily.

Ashford wrote the novel in an exercise book at the age of nine in 1890.  Full of spelling mistakes, each chapter was written as a single paragraph.  Many years later, in 1917 and aged 36, Ashford rediscovered her manuscript languishing in a drawer, and lent it to Margaret Mackenzie, a friend who was recovering from influenza. It passed through several other hands before it reachedFrank Swinnerton, a novelist who was also a reader for the publishersChatto and Windus.  Largely due to Swinnerton's enthusiasm for this piece ofjuvenilia, the book was published almost exactly as it had been written.J. M. Barrie, the creator ofPeter Pan, agreed to write a preface.[2]

The original manuscript ofThe Young Visitersis held in the Berg Collection of theNew York Public Library.[3]

The book was so successful that it had been reprinted 19 times by 1936. After its publication, rumours soon started that the book was in fact an elaborate literary hoax and that it had been written by J. M. Barrie himself. These rumours persisted for years.[2]

A stage play ofThe Young Visitersby Mrs George Norman and Margaret Mackenzie was first performed in London in 1920 and transferred shortly afterwards to New York.  The New York production, at the Thirty-Ninth Street Theatre, received generally good reviews. One reviewer stated that

A two-act musical comedy version,Quite a Young GirlbyAlicen White,Martha D Coeand Peter Colonna, was written in 1960. Whilst it received the authorâ€™s blessing, they ultimately failed to find a producer.[5]

A musical by Michael Ashton andIan Kellambased on the book was produced in 1968.[6]

A feature-length film was made in 1984 starringTracey UllmanandJohn Standing.

A television film version was made by theBBCin 2003 starringJim Broadbentas Alfred Salteena,Lyndsey Marshalas Ethel Monticue andHugh Laurieas Lord Bernard Clark. The screenplay was written byPatrick Barlowand it was directed byDavid Yates.[7]

Evelyn Waughmentions the book in his novelA Handful of Dust(1934) as part of the childhood reading of his hero Tony Last.

The criticEdmund Wilsonreferred to the novelThis Side of Paradise(1920) by his friendF. Scott Fitzgeraldas "a classic in a class withThe Young Visiters", meaning that Fitzgerald's book had a rather naive style.[8]

Elizabeth MacKintoshwriting asJosephine Teymentions the book in her novelMiss Pym Disposes(1947) as a book "that makes everyone smile".

Margaret MacMillanin her history of the Paris Peace Conference "Paris 1919;  Six Months That Changed The World" mentions in passing (page 73) that "The Young Visiters",  "a comic novel written by a child",  was "the most popular book of 1919".
