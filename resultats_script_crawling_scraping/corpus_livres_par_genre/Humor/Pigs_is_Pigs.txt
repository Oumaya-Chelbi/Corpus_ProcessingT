Railway agent Mike Flannery wants to charge the livestock rate for a shipment of twoguinea pigsand refuses to accept the lower pet rate, saying "pigs is pigs." Flannery believes that the "guinea" is an indication of the pigs' national origin. He argues that they should bear the higher freight charge of 30¢ for livestock, rather than the lower 25¢ for domestic pets. In support of this, he submits that if they were "dago pigs" or "Irish pigs," there would be no question of the animals' status.

Because the customer refuses to accept delivery, Flannery is forced to feed and house what he now calls the "dago pigs" in his office. When he eventually receives instructions to accept the lower price, he discovers that the customer has moved. He is then instructed by his superiors to return the pigs to the company warehouse. By this time, the guinea pigs have reproduced exponentially in Flannery's station house. After returning all the descendants, Flannery resolves to charge the lower rate for any future livestock.

The story was made into movie form several times, including theWalt Disneycartoon in 1954 that was nominated for anAcademy Award for Animated Short Film. The 1937Merrie MelodiescartoonPigs Is Pigs, directed byFriz Freleng, is not an adaptation of the Butler story.

The rapid reproduction of the guinea pigs and their near overrunning of a facility is mirrored by the Martian flat cats in theRobert A. HeinleinnovelThe Rolling Stones. Heinlein admitted he took inspiration from Butler but never plagiarized him.[1]In a note toDavid Gerroldover the similarity ofStar Trek'stribblesto his flat cats, Gerrold claims that Heinlein wrote to him, “we both owe something to Ellis Parker Butler...and possibly to Noah.”[2]
