The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled "staves".

A Christmas Carolopens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death ofEbenezer Scrooge's business partner,Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageingmiser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaidclerk,Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.

That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.

The first spirit, theGhost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer,Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.

The second spirit, theGhost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market where people are buying the makings ofChristmas dinnerand to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in alighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son,Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.

The third spirit, theGhost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. Hischarwoman,laundressand the localundertakersteal his possessions to sell to afence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.

Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.

The writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature ofhis father John. In 1824 John was committed to theMarshalsea, adebtors' prisoninSouthwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced topawnhis collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infestedshoe-blackingfactory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a "deep personal and social outrage", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.[1]

By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works[n 1]as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces.[2]On 31 December that year he began publishing his novelMartin Chuzzlewitas a monthly serial;[n 2]it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.[3]

Celebrating theChristmas seasonhad been growing in popularity through theVictorian era.[4]TheChristmas treewas introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised byQueen VictoriaandPrince Albert.[5]In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest inChristmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication ofDavies Gilbert's 1823 workSome Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of EnglandandWilliam Sandys's1833 collectionChristmas Carols, Ancient and Modernled to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.[6]

Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was "Christmas Festivities", published inBell's Weekly Messengerin 1835; the story was then published as "A Christmas Dinner" inSketches by Boz(1836).[7]"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novelThe Pickwick Papers. In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropicsexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited bygoblinswho show him the past and future.[8]Slater considers that "the main elements of theCarolare present in the story", but not yet in a firm form.[9]The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorialMaster Humphrey's Clock.[9]The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the "Goblins" story appears to be a prototype ofA Christmas Carol, all Dickens's earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.[10]

Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[11]Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens wasWashington Irving, whose 1819–20 workThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.included four essays on old EnglishChristmas traditionsthat he experienced while staying atAston Hallnear Birmingham.[12]The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.[13]

Several works had an influence on the writing ofA Christmas Carol, including two essays by his friendDouglas Jerrold: one from an 1841 issue ofPunch, "How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas" and one from 1843, "The Beauties of the Police".[14]More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[15]

Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[16]In early 1843 he toured theCornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeingchildren workingin appalling conditions.[17]The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field LaneRagged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.[18]

In February 1843 theSecond Report of the Children's Employment Commissionwas published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of theIndustrial Revolutionupon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled,An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year.[19]In March he wrote to DrSouthwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for theSecond Report, about his change in plans: "you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea".[20]

In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at theManchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[21]and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[22]

By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales ofMartin Chuzzlewitwere falling off, and his wife,Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened whenChapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further.[23]He beganA Christmas Carolin October 1843.[24]Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being "written at white heat"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December.[25]He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) around London.[26]Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he "wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition".[27]Slater says thatA Christmas Carolwas

George Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens onSketches by Boz(1836) andOliver Twist(1838), introduced him to the caricaturistJohn Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work onA Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[28]Dickens's hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph "... and to Tiny Tim, who didnotdie"; this was added later, during the printing process.[29][n 3]

The central character ofA Christmas Carolis Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman,[30]described in the story as "a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!"[31]Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[32]The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty "is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[33]

Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentricJohn Elwes,MP,[34]orJemmy Wood, the owner of theGloucester Old Bankand also known as "The Gloucester Miser".[35]According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of thedemographerandpolitical economistThomas Malthus,[36]while the miser's questions "Are there no prisons? ... And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopherThomas Carlyle, "Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?"[37][n 4]

There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works.Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is "a more fantastic image" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[39]Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub fromThe Pickwick Paperswas also an influence when creating Scrooge.[40][n 5]It is possible that Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as "mean man".[42][n 6]This theory has been described as "a probable Dickens hoax" for which "[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence".[44]

When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign "Goodge and Marney", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[45]For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to theWestern PenitentiaryinPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners.[37]For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the timeA Christmas Carolwas written.[46][n 7]The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in theEast End of London.[18]

The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[48]Davis considers Scrooge to be "aproteanfigure always in process of reformation";[49]Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who "possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities".[50]Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running throughA Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as anallegoryof the Christian concept ofredemption.[51][n 8]Dickens's biographer,Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that "even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man".[54]Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex;[n 9]he based his beliefs and principles on theNew Testament.[53]His statement that Marley "had no bowels" is a reference to the "bowels of compassion" mentioned in theFirst Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[57][n 10]

Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a "secular vision of this sacred holiday".[11]The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues thatA Christmas Carolshows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friendJohn Forsteras his "Carolphilosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside".[58]From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores "the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects" of Dickens's "Carolphilosophy" ofcharityandaltruism.[59]

Dickens wroteA Christmas Carolin response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularlychild poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[60]The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[61]The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim.[62]Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[63]

As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures ofMartin Chuzzlewit,[64]Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[33]Production ofA Christmas Carolwas not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive greenendpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens's publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades.[65]The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[66]Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in redMorocco leatherand presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[67][n 11]

Priced at five shillings (equal to £31 in 2025 pounds),[68]the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[70]By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[71]Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[72]It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[52]

The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £29,000 in 2025 pounds)[68]rather than the £1,000 (equal to £124,000 in 2025 pounds)[68]he expected.[73]A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[64][n 12]

According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews ofA Christmas Carol"were almost uniformly kind".[75]The Illustrated London Newsdescribed how the story's "impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity" all put the reader "in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author".[76]The critic fromThe Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a "tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King."[77]William Makepeace Thackeray, writing inFraser's Magazine, described the book as "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'"[74]

The poetThomas Hood, inhis own journal, wrote that "If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease."[78]The reviewer forTait's Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[75]—spoke well ofA Christmas Carol, noting it was "a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good".[79]After Dickens's death,Margaret Oliphantdeplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as "a new gospel", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better.[75]The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844,Christian Remembrancerthought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[80]The writer and social thinkerJohn Ruskintold a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as "mistletoe and pudding—neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds".[81]

There were critics of the book.The New Monthly Magazinepraised the story, but thought the book's physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[82]An unnamed writer forThe Westminster Reviewmocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking "Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without".[83]

Dickens had criticised the US inAmerican NotesandMartin Chuzzlewit, making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of theAmerican Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households.[84]In 1863The New York Timespublished an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the "old Christmas ... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today".[85]

In January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold fortwopence.[n 13]Dickens wrote to his solicitor

Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis ofcopyright infringementand won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs.[88]The small profits Dickens earned fromA Christmas Carolfurther strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour ofBradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[16]

Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories:The Chimes(1844),The Cricket on the Hearth(1845),The Battle of Life(1846) andThe Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain(1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[89]
