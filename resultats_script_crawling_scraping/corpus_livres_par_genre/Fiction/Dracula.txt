Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified Englishsolicitor, visitsCount Draculaathis castlein theCarpathian Mountainsto help the Count purchase a house near London. Ignoring the Count's warning, Harker wanders the castle at night and encountersthree vampire women; Dracula rescues Harker, and gives the women a small child bound inside a bag. Six weeks later, Dracula leaves the castle, abandoning Harker to the women. Harker escapes and ends up delirious in aBudapesthospital. Dracula takes a ship called theDemeterfor England with boxes of earth from his castle. The captain'slognarrates the crew's disappearance until he alone remains, bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling a large dog is seen leaping ashore when the ship runs aground atWhitby.

Lucy Westenra's letter to her best friend, Harker's fiancéeMina Murray, describes her marriage proposals fromDr. John Seward,Quincey Morris, andArthur Holmwood. Lucy accepts Holmwood's, but all remain friends. Mina joins Lucy on holiday in Whitby. Lucy begins tosleepwalk. After Dracula's ship lands in Whitby, he begins to stalk Lucy. Mina receives a letter about her missing fiancé's illness and goes to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill; Seward's old teacher—Professor Abraham Van Helsing—determines the nature of her condition, but he refuses to disclose it, instead diagnosing it as acuteblood-loss. Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a necklace of them. Lucy's mother removes the garlic flowers, not knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra dies of aheart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a "bloofer lady" (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is Lucy. Seward, Morris, Arthur and Van Helsing go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They stake her heart,beheadher, and fill her mouth with garlic. Jonathan Harker and his new bride Mina return and join the campaign against Dracula.

Everyone stays at Seward's asylum as the men begin to hunt Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient,Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their life force. After Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he uses Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times, drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on the final visit, cursing her to become a vampire after her death unless Dracula is killed. The men discover that Dracula has distributed his boxes of earth around various properties in London. After sterilizing most of the distributed boxes, the group fails to trap the Count in hisPiccadillyhouse and learns that Dracula is fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing exploits Mina's faint psychic connection to Dracula to track his movements and they pursue, guided by Mina.

InGalatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Harker and Holmwood pursue Dracula's boat on the river, while Morris and Seward follow them on land. Dracula's box is loaded onto a wagon byRomanimen; the hunters attack and rout the Romani. HarkerdecapitatesDracula as Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Romani. He dies, at peace knowing that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.

Bram Stokerwas born inClontarf, Dublinon 8 November 1842 as the third of seven children. A sickly child, he was homeschooled before attending a private day school.[1]Stoker attendedTrinity College Dublinin the 1860s and began writing theatre reviews in the early 1870s. After Stoker wrote a review of a performance by stage actorHenry Irving, the two became friends. In 1878, Irving offered Stoker a job as the business manager of London'sLyceum Theatre, which he accepted. He marriedFlorence Balcombelater that year.[2]Biographer Lisa Hopkins notes that this role required Stoker to be sociable and introduced him to the elites ofVictorian London. Nonetheless, Stoker described himself as a private person who closely guarded his thoughts.[3]

He supplemented his theatre income by writingromanceandsensation novels,[4][5][a]but was more closely identified during his lifetime with the theatre than he was with the literary world.[7]By the time of his death in 1912, Stoker had published 18 books.[8]Draculawas Stoker's seventh published book, followingThe Shoulder of Shasta(1895) and precedingMiss Betty(1898).[9][b]Stoker's grand-nephew,Daniel Farson, wrote that Stoker may have died from syphilis, but this is widely disputed by scholars.[c]Novelist and playwrightHall Caine, a close friend of Stoker's,[d]wrote in Stoker's obituary inThe Daily Telegraphthat—besides hisbiographyon Irving—Stoker wrote only "to sell" and "had no higher aims".[15]

Folkloric vampires predate Stoker's Dracula by hundreds of years.[16]Stoker adopted some characteristics of folkloric vampires for his own, such as their aversion to garlic and staking as a means of killing them.[17]He invented other attributes—for example, Stoker's vampires must be invited into one's home, sleep on earth from their homeland and have no reflection in mirrors.[18]Sunlight is not fatal to Dracula in the novel—this was an invention of the unauthorisedDraculafilmNosferatu(1922)—but it does weaken him.[19][20]Some of Stoker's inventions applied unrelated lore to vampires for the first time; for example, Dracula has no reflection because of a folkloric concept that mirrors show the human soul.[20]Some Irish scholars have suggestedIrish folkloreas an inspiration for the novel,[21]for example the revenantAbhartach,[21]and the 11th-century High King of IrelandBrian Boru.[22][e]DraculascholarElizabeth Millernotes that in his childhood Stoker was exposed to supernatural tales and Irish oral history involving premature burials and staked bodies.[24]

Count Draculahas literary progenitors.John William Polidori's "The Vampyre" (1819) includes an aristocratic vampire with powers of seduction.[25]The lesbian vampire ofSheridan Le Fanu'sCarmilla(1872) can transform into a cat, as Dracula can transform into a dog.[26]Dracula resembles earlier Gothic villains in appearance,[27]with Miller comparing him to the villains ofAnn Radcliffe'sThe Italian(1796) andMatthew Gregory Lewis'sThe Monk(1796).[28]

There is almost unanimous consensus that Dracula was inspired, in part, by Henry Irving. Scholars note the Count's tall and lean physique and aquiline nose,[29]withDraculascholarWilliam Hughesspecifically citing the influence of Irving's performance asShylockin aLyceum Theatreproduction ofThe Merchant of Venice.[30]Stoker's contemporaries remarked upon the similarity.[31]Stoker had praised a performance of Irving as "a wonderful impression of a dead man fictitiously alive [with eyes like] cinders of glowing red from out the marble face".[32]Louis S. Warrenwrites thatDraculawas founded on "the fear and animosity his employer inspired in him".[33][f]Miller contests this, describing Stoker's attitude towards him as "adulation".[35]

Historical figures have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula but there is no consensus. In a 1972 book,Raymond T. McNallyandRadu Florescupopularised the idea thatÁrmin Vámbérysupplied Stoker with information aboutVlad Dracula, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler.[36][g]Their investigation, however, found nothing about "Vlad, Dracula, or vampires" within Vámbéry's published papers,[38]nor in Stoker's notes about their meeting.[37]Miller calls the link to Vlad III "tenuous", indicating that Stoker incorporated a large amount of "insignificant detail" from his research, andrhetoricallyasking why he would omit Vlad III's infamous cruelty.[39][h]McNally additionally suggested in 1983 that the crimes ofElizabeth Báthoryinspired Stoker.[42][i]A book used by Stoker for research,The Book of Were-Wolves, does contain some information on Báthory, but Stoker never took notes from the short section devoted to her.[45]Miller and her co-authorRobert Eighteen-Bisangconcur that there is no evidence Báthory inspired Stoker.[46][j][k]

Prior to writing the novel, Stoker researched extensively, assembling over 100 pages of notes, including chapter summaries and plot outlines.[49][l]Stoker undertook some of his research at a library at Whitby in the summer of 1890 but most was done at theLondon Library.[51]The earliest dated notes are from 8 March 1890, comprising an outline of the novel's opening.[52]Joseph S. Beirman notes that it differs from the final novel "in only a few details": The Count and Harker are not given names. The wordvampireis not used explicitly, but it depicts the Count's possessive fury over Harker and a female who attempts "to kiss him not on lips but throat".[53][52]In February 1892, Stoker wrote a 27-chapter outline of the novel; according to Miller, "all the key pieces of the jigsaw were in place".[54]

Stoker's notes reveal other scrapped concepts. Bierman says that Stoker always intended to write an epistolary novel but originally set it in Styria instead of Transylvania.[53]Other concepts from the notes include a German professor called Max Windshoeffel confronting a "Count Wampyr" and one of the vampire hunters would have been slain by awerewolf.[55][m]Stoker biographer Barbara Belford notes evidence that Stoker intended to write adetective story, with a detective called Cotford and apsychical investigatorcalled Singleton.[57]

Stoker took the name Dracula from William Wilkinson's history of Wallachia and Moldavia (1820),[23]which he probably found in Whitby's public library while holidaying there in 1890.[58]Stoker copied the following footnote from the book: "Dracula means devil. Wallachians were accustomed to give it as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous by courage, cruel actions or cunning".[59]

Stoker stated that that it took him about three years to write the novel, and it is likely that he wrote most of the manuscript during his summer holidays inCruden Bay, Scotland from 1893 to 1896.[60]Stoker generally wrote in spare time from his duties as Irving's business manager, and the long gestation of the novel is indicative of the importance he placed on it.[61][62]

Early Stoker biographer Barbara Belford noted the novel looked "shabby" because of a last-minute title change;[63]the printer's copy of the typescript, with hand-written amendments, is titledThe Un-Dead.[64][n]The surviving typewritten publishing agreement was signed and dated 25 May 1897; Peter Beal ofSotheby'ssuggests its signing one day before the official publication date indicates that it was a formality.[66]To protect his copyright interest for adaptations,[o]Stoker organised a reading of his stage adaptation of the novel in the week before publication in theLyceum Theatre. A small group, primarily theatre staff, attended the reading, andEdith Craigplayed Mina.[68]

Bound in yellow cloth and titled in red letters,Draculawas published in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. It cost 6shillings.[69]Uncertainty exists around the exact date of publication, but it was probably published on 26 May 1897. Stoker wrote toWilliam Gladstonethat the novel would be released on the 26th.[70][p]Paul McAlduff writes that it was published "on or about May 26".[72]Eighteen-Bisang states it could have been published anywhere from late May to June 1897.[73]

Stoker's mother,Charlotte Stoker, enthused about the novel and predicted it would bring her son immense financial success. She was wrong: the novel, although reviewed well, failed to earn Stoker much money and did not establish his critical reputation until after his death.[74]For the first thousand sales ofDracula, Stoker earned no royalties.[5]Following serialisation by American newspapers,Doubleday & McClurepublished an American edition in 1899 with some textual changes.[63]A cheaper paperback version was published by Constable in 1901, but few copies have survived.[75]The text is around 15% shorter than the original but it is not known if Stoker made the amendments.[76]Since its publication,Draculahas never beenout of print.[77]

An edition of the novel edited by McNally and Florescu in 1979 was the first to includeDracula's "missing chapter", "Dracula's Guest".[78]Bram's widowFlorence Stokerincluded the chapter as a short story inDracula's Guest and Other Weird Tales(1914), two years after his death.[79]While some commentators have described the prose asDracula'sdiscarded first chapter, Clive Leatherdale contests this, arguing that the material was incorporated into the published novel.[80]

Draculais anepistolary novel.[81]Compared to other elements of the novel, critic David Seed writes that its epistolary structure has been neglected in analyses.[82]Critics note Stoker's decision to structure the novel this way may relate to a 19th-century trend of publishing diaries and travelogue accounts,[83]especially with Harker's account of the journey to Transylvania.[84]Seed writes that Harker's initial four chapters function as a "miniaturised-pastiche-Gothic novel"—replacing Radcliffe's use of theApennine MountainsinThe Mysteries of Udolpho(1794) with theCarpathian MountainsofTransylvania[85]—and places this within the Gothic tradition ofintertextuality.[86]

David Seed argues that the structure only provides a narrative voice to Dracula's opponents,[87]while Miller writes that the "collaborative narration" reinforces the idea that Dracula must be defeated by the combined effort of his opponents.[83]Allison Case says Seed views that Dracula's absence generates tension by offering only "tantalizing glimpses" of his activities,[87]while literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that it highlights the power struggle between the vampire and his hunters.[88]Similarly, Allison Case views the structure as representing a power struggle between Mina and the male protagonists for "narrative mastery".[89]Seed notes that the narrative's style distances the reader from its plot. Dracula's journey on theDemeteris captured by the captain on thelogbook, then "translated by the Russian consul, transcribed by a local journalist, and finally pasted by Mina into her journal".[90]

Draculais an enduring work ofGothic literature,[91]with some critics locating it within the traditions ofIrish GothicorUrban Gothic.[92][93][94]John C. Tibbetts considersDraculaa prototype for later themes in the Gothic genre.[95]The novel is characteristically Gothic in its depiction of the supernatural, preoccupation with the past,[96]and embodying of the racial, gendered and sexual anxieties offin de siècleEngland.[97]Count Dracula generally represents these tensions: cultural criticJack Halberstamnotes that he is masculinised and feminised;[98]Jerrold E. Hogle highlights his attraction to both Jonathan and Mina, and his appearance as racially western and eastern.[99]Miller notes that the Count's physical characteristics were typical of Gothic villains during Stoker's lifetime, specifically citing his hooked nose,pallor, large moustache and thick eyebrows as influenced by his villainous predecessors.[100]Draculadeviates from other Gothic tales before it by firmly establishing its time as the modern era,[101]a point raised by one contemporary reviewer.[102]Writers of the mode were drawn to the Eastern Europe setting because travelogues presented it as a land of primitive superstitions.[103]

Modern critics frequently write thatDraculahad a mixed critical reception upon publication.[104]Carol Margaret Davison, for example, notes an "uneven" response from critics contemporary to Stoker.[69]John Edgar Browning, a scholar whose research focuses onDraculaand literary vampires, conducted a review of the novel's early criticism in 2012 and determined thatDraculahad been "a critically acclaimed novel".[105][q]Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu'sIn Search of Dracula(1972) mentions the novel's "immediate success".[107][r]Other works aboutDraculaalso published in 1972 concur; Gabriel Ronay says the novel was "recognised by fans and critics alike as a horror writer's stroke of genius",[108]and Anthony Masters mentions the novel's "enormous popular appeal".[109]Since the 1970s,Draculahas been the subject of significant academic interest; the novel has spawned many nonfiction books and articles, and has a dedicated peer-reviewed journal.[48]Publishers started creating editions aimed at classroom teaching in the 1980s, providing the novel alongside historical context and scholarly analysis.[110]The novel's complexity has permitted a flexibility of interpretation, with Anca Andriescu Garcia describing interest from scholars ofpsychoanalysis,postcolonialism, social class and the Gothic genre.[111]

Contemporary reviewers frequently compared the novel to other Gothic writers. Comparisons to novelistWilkie CollinsandThe Woman in White(1859) were especially common, owing to similarities in structure and style.[113][s]A review appearing inThe Booksellernotes that the novel could almost have been written by Collins,[114]and an anonymous review inSaturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Artwrote thatDraculaimproved upon the style of Gothic pioneerAnn Radcliffe;[115]Radcliffe was also referenced byThe Daily Mail,[t]which also highlightedThe Mysteries of Udolpho,Frankenstein(1818), andThe Fall of the House of Usher(1839).[112][116]Another anonymous writer described Stoker as "the Edgar Allan Poe of the nineties".[117]Other favourable comparisons to other Gothic novelists included theBrontë sistersandMary Shelley.[118][69]Arthur Conan Doylesent a letter to Stoker after readingDracula, writing: "The old Professor is most excellent and so are the two girls. I congratulate you with all my heart for having written so fine a book."[119]

Many of these early reviews were charmed by Stoker's treatment of the vampire myth.The Daily Telegraphcalled it the best vampire story ever written.The Daily Telegraph'sreviewer noted that while earlier Gothic works, likeThe Castle of Otranto, had kept the supernatural far away from the novelists' home countries,Dracula'shorrors occurred in foreign lands and at home in Whitby andHampstead Heath.[102]An Australian paper,The Advertiser, regarded the novel as simultaneouslysensationaland domestic.[120]One reviewer praised the "considerable power" of Stoker's prose and described it asimpressionistic. They were less fond of the parts set in England, finding the vampire suited better to tales set far away from home.[121]The British magazineVanity Fairfound Dracula's disdain for garlic unintentionally funny.[122]

Draculawas considered frightening. A review appearing inThe Manchester Guardianin 1897 praised its capacity to entertain, but concluded that Stoker erred in including so much horror.[123]Likewise,Vanity Fairopined that the novel was "praiseworthy" and absorbing, but could not recommend it to those who were not "strong".[122]Stoker's prose was commended as effective in sustaining the novel's horror by many publications.[124]A reviewer for theSan Francisco Wavecalled the novel a "literary failure"; they elaborated that coupling vampires with frightening imagery, such as insane asylums and "unnatural appetites", made the horror too overt, and that other works in the genre, such asStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886), had more restraint.[125]

Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently discussed themes,[126]and modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality.[127][128]Across the novel's critical history, Miller writes that theorists have collectively argued that the Count breaks virtually "every Victorian taboo", includingnon-procreative sex(includingfellatio), transgressive sexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.[129]

Transgressiveor abnormal sexuality withinDraculais a broad topic. Some psychosexual critics explore the novel'sdisruptionof Victoriangender roles; within the Victorian context, Christopher Craft writes males had "the right and responsibility of vigorous appetite" while women were required to "suffer and be still".[130]Critics highlight the many places in which the novel disrupts these social mores: Jonathan Harker's excitement over the prospect of being penetrated;[131]Dracula's resulting anger and jealousy;[132]and Lucy's transformation into a sexually aggressive predator who drains "vital fluid".[133]Some critics, including professorCarol Senf, argue that the novel reflects anxiety about female sexual awakening as a threat to established norms.[134][135]

Draculacontains no overt homosexual acts, but homosexuality andhomoeroticismare elements discussed by critics.[136]Christopher Craft argues that the primary threat Dracula poses is that he will "seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male",[137]and reads Harker's excitement to submit as a proxy for "an implicitly homoerotic desire".[137]Victorian readers would have identified Dracula with sexual threat.[138]Some critics note that changes made to the 1899 American version of the text reinforce this subtext, wherein Dracula states he will feed on Harker.[139][140]Critics have variously linked these themes tohomoeroticletters Stoker wrote toWalt Whitman, his friendship withOscar Wilde,[141][u]his intensely emotional relationship with Irving, and contemporary rumours of Stoker's almostsexless marriage.[141][143][144]David J. Skalacknowledged the letters' subtext but cautioned against applyinganachronisticmodern sexual labels to Stoker.[145]

Many critics have suggested that the novel reveals a "reactionaryresponse" to theNew Womanphenomenon.[89]This is a late-Victorian term used to describe an emerging class of women with increased social and economic control over their lives.[146][147][148]Several critics describe the battle against Dracula as a fight for control over women's bodies.[149][150]Senf suggests that Stoker was ambivalent about the New Woman phenomenon,[151]while Signorroti argues that the novel's discomfort with female sexual autonomy reflects Stoker's dislike for the movement.[147]Both Lucy and Mina have characteristics associated with the New Woman;[152][v]Mina, who plays an important role in Dracula's defeat, repeatedly expresses contempt for the concept.[154][151]Senf notes that Lucy is punished for expressing dissatisfaction with her social position as a woman. After her transformation into a vampire, her defeat by the vampire hunters symbolises the re-establishment of "male supremacy".[155]

Dracula, and specifically the Count's migration to Victorian England, is frequently read as emblematic ofinvasion literature,[156]and a projection of fears about racial pollution.[157]In an influentialpostcolonialistanalysis,[158]Stephen Arata describes the novel's cultural context of mounting anxiety in Britain over the decline of theBritish Empire, the rise of otherworld powers, and a "growing domestic unease" over the morality of imperial colonisation.[159]Arata regards the novel as an instance of "reverse colonisation": fear of other races invading England and weakening its racial purity.[160]Patricia McKee writes that Dracula represents a negation of white culture while Mina represents "pure whiteness".[161]Dracula can be said to both kill white bodies and turn them into theracial Otherin death.[162]Some critics connect the racialisation of Dracula to his depiction as adegenerate criminal.[163][164]

Critics frequently identifyantisemiticthemes and imagery in the novel. Between 1891 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England increased sixfold, mainly due to antisemitic legislation andpogromsin eastern Europe.[165]Examples cited byJack Halberstamof antisemitic connections include Dracula's appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and "lack of allegiance" to one country.[166][w]Dracula's appearance resembles some other cultural depictions of Jews, such asFagininCharles Dickens'sOliver Twist(1838), andSvengaliofGeorge du Maurier'sTrilby(1895).[168]Jewish people were frequently described as parasites inVictorian literature; Halberstam highlights fears that Jews would spread diseases of the blood, and one journalist's description of Jews as "Yiddish bloodsuckers".[169]Daniel Renshaw writes that any antisemitism in the text is "semi-subliminal"; he writes that Dracula is not Jewish but does reflect the 19th-century conception of Jewish people. Renshaw frames the novel more broadly as a general suspicion of all foreigners.[170]

The novel's depiction ofSlovaksandRomani peoplehas attracted limited scholarly attention.[171]In the novel, Harker describes the Slovaks as "barbarians" and their boats as "primitive", reflecting his imperialistic condescension towards other cultures.[172]Peter Arnds writes that the Count's control over the Romani and his abduction of young children evoke folk superstitions about Romani people stealing children, and that his ability to transform into a wolf is related to xenophobic beliefs about the Romani as animalistic.[173]Croley argues that Dracula's association with the Romani made him suspect in the eyes of Victorian England, where they were stigmatised owing to beliefs that they ate "unclean meat" and lived among animals.[174]

Draculais saturated with religious imagery. Christopher Herbert regards the novel as aparableabout conflict with an enemy who opposes Christ and Christianity.[175]Scholars discuss the novel's depiction of religion in relation to late Victorian anxieties about the threat which secularism, scientific rationalism and the occult posed to Christian beliefs and morality.[176]Stoker himself had a lifelong interest insupernaturalinquiry,[177]and Herbert writes that he mixes the supernatural and superstitious beliefs with religious elements, resulting in metaphors about moral uncleanness becoming literal elements of the text's "occult reality".[178]Herbert notes that theblood of Christis important to Christian ritual and imagery,[179]and Richard Noll notes that actual consumption of human blood is one of the oldestJudeo-Christiantaboos.[180]

The vampire hunters use many weapons—including Christian practices and symbols (prayer, crucifixes andconsecrated hosts), folkloric practices (garlic, staking and decapitation) and contemporary technology (typewriters,phonographs, telegrams, blood transfusions andWinchester rifles)—in their battle against Dracula.[181][182][183]Sanders argues that Stoker presents Christianity as a religion that can be instrumentalised and incorporated into scientific knowledge.[184]Herbert describes Van Helsing's "Christian purification" of Lucy as punitively addressing her promiscuity, and the resulting framing of Christianity as a means towards the "eradication ofdeviancy".[185]

Critics discuss the novel in relation toBritish rule in IrelandandIrish nationalism. Considerable debate exists over whetherDraculais an Irish novel; while it is largely set in England, Stoker was born in British-ruled Ireland and lived there for the first 30 years of his life.[186][187]Though born into aProtestantfamily, he was distanced from the religion's more conservative factions.[188]

Ralph Ingelbien notes that "recognizably nationalist" critics likeTerry EagletonandSeamus Deanefavoured readings of Dracula as "a bloodthirsty caricature of the aristocratic landlord" where the vampire represents the death offeudalism.[189]Bruce Stewart changes the focus to the lower classes,[189]suggesting Dracula and his Romani followers more likely represented violence byIrish National Land Leagueactivists.[190]Michael Valdez Moses compares Dracula to the disgracedCharles Stewart Parnell, leader of theIrish Home Rule movementfrom 1880 to 1882.[188][191]Robert Smart argues that Stoker's experience during theGreat Famine(1845–1852) influenced the novel,[192]with Stewart also noting this as historical context.[186]

Some critics discuss Count Dracula'snoble title. Literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that he is an aristocrat "only in a manner of speaking", citing his lack of servants, simple clothing, and lack of aristocratic hobbies. Moretti suggests that Dracula's blood thirst represents capital's desire to accumulate more capital.[193]More generally, Moretti argues the novel evinces cultural anxiety about foreigncapitalist monopoliesfunctioning as a return of feudalism.[194]Chris Baldick maintains this line of analysis, describing Dracula as an undead symbol of feudalism but concluding that the novel is more concerned with "sexual and religious terrors".[195]Mark Neocleous writes that Dracula symbolises the victory of the bourgeoisie over feudalism.[196]InDas Kapital,Karl Marxcompared thebourgeoisie's exploitation ofworkersto a vampire draining blood.[197]He uses vampires as a metaphor three times inDas Kapital, but these predate the writing ofDracula.[198]

Contagious disease was a topic of social and medical concern in late Victorian England.[199]Vampirism can represent disease, being both an initial infection and the resulting illness.[200]The novel characterises vampirism with terms fromsocial degeneration theory,[201]an 18th- and 19th-century social and biological concept arising from fear over the deterioration of the "human condition";[202]Victorian psychiatry, known then as "alienism";[203]and anthropology.[204]Theories of degeneracy propagated Victorian-era beliefs about poor moral character beingtransmissiblelike a pathogen.[201]Jack Halberstamwrites that Dracula and Renfield's relationship suggests that vampirism is "a psychological disorder, an addictive activity".[205]He notes that Renfield, and by association Dracula, is described by doctors using terminology more appropriate for describing animals.[205]Brian Aldisswrites that Count Dracula represents the initial disease while Renfield's madness is a symptom of advanced infection.[206]Halbertstam highlights that disease was frequently associated with Jews during the period.[207]Sexually transmitted infection, particularlysyphilis, is a frequent topic.[208]Literary critic Martin Willis writes that the novel depicts Victorian discourse over the origin, cause and treatment of disease, especially in the context of Lucy's treatment and eventual death.[200]
