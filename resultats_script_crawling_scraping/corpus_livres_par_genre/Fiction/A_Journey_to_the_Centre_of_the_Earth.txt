The story begins in May 1863, at the home of Professor Otto Lidenbrock inHamburg,Germany. While leafing through an original runic manuscript of an Icelandicsaga, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a cyphered note written inrunic scriptalong with the name of a 16th-century Icelandicalchemist, Arne Saknussemm. When translated into English, the note reads:

Lidenbrock departs for Iceland immediately, taking the reluctant Axel with him. After a swift trip viaKielandCopenhagen, they arrive inReykjavík. There they hire as their guide Icelander Hans Bjelke, a Danish-speakingeiderduckhunter, then travel overland to the base ofSnæfellsjökull.

In late June they reach the volcano and set off into the bowels of the earth, encountering many dangers and strange phenomena. After taking a wrong turn, they run short of water and Axel nearly perishes, but Hans saves them all by tapping into asubterranean river, which shoots out a stream of water that Lidenbrock and Axel name the "Hansbach" in the guide's honor.

Following the course of the Hansbach, the explorers descend many miles, during which, Axel accidentally gets separated from Lidenbrock and Hans and briefly gets lost in the caverns, but survives a rockslide before being found again.  Eventually, the explorers reach an underground world, with an ocean (which Lidenbrock christens the Lidenbrock Sea, after himself) and a vast ceiling with clouds, as well as a permanentAuroragiving light. The travelers build a raft out of semipetrified wood and set sail. On the shoreline, they see thegazelle-likeLeptotherium, thecattle-likeMerycotherium, aLophiodon(which is described to betapir-like), anAnoplotherium(which is described to be a compound of ahorse, arhinoceros, acamel, and ahippopotamus), amastodon, aMegatherium, and aProtopithecuswhile aPterodactylusflies in the sky.

While at sea, they encounter prehistoric fish such asPterichthyodes(here called "Pterichthys")Dipterus(referred to as "Dipterides") and giant marine reptiles from the Age of theDinosaurs, namely anIchthyosaurusand aPlesiosaurus, in which a fight between the monsters almost endangers the raft. A lightning storm threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the site of an enormous fossil graveyard (which Lidenbrock, at first, thinks is on the coast they'd departed from, assuming the storm blew them back the way they'd come), including bones from aPterodactylus, aMegatherium, aDeinotherium, aGlyptodon,amammothand the preserved body of a prehistoric hominid.

Lidenbrock and Axel venture into a forest featuring primitive vegetation from theTertiary Period. In its depths they are stunned to find a prehistoric humanoid that is described to be more than twelve feet in height with a head that was huge and unshapely like aEuropean bison, a mane that is similar to a prehistoricelephantthat hid most of its head, and wielding a primitive staff. It was watching over a herd of mastodons like ashepherdand surpassed the height of the known prehistoric hominids that Lidenbrock and Axel know. Fearing the humanoid may be hostile, Lidenbrock and Axel leave the forest before it can see them.

Continuing to explore the coastline, the travellers find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead, but it has been blocked by a recent cave-in. The adventurers lay plans to blow the rock open withgun cotton, meanwhile paddling their raft out to sea to avoid the blast. On executing this scheme, they open a bottomless pit beyond the impeding rock and are swept into it as the sea rushes down the huge open gap. After spending hours descending at breakneck speed, their raft reverses direction and rises inside a volcanic chimney that ultimately spews them into the open air. When they regain consciousness, they learn that they have been ejected fromStromboli, avolcanic islandlocated offSicily.

The trio returns to Germany, where they enjoy great acclaim; Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of the day, Axel discovers that the poles on the compass got reversed during the storm and marries his sweetheart Gräuben, and Hans returns to his peaceful, eiderduck-hunting life inIceland.

The original French editions of 1864 and 1868 were issued by J. Hetzel et Cie, a major Paris publishing house owned byPierre-Jules Hetzel.

The novel's first English edition, translated by an unknown hand and published in 1871 by the London house Griffith & Farran, appeared under the titleA Journey to the Centre of the Earthand is now available atProject Gutenberg.[2]A drastically rewritten version of the story, it adds chapter titles where Verne gives none, meanwhile changing the professor's surname to Hardwigg, Axel's name to Harry, and Gräuben's to Gretchen. In addition, many paragraphs and details are completely recomposed.[citation needed]

An 1877 London edition from Ward, Lock, & Co. appeared under the titleA Journey into the Interior of the Earth. Its translation, credited to Frederick Amadeus Malleson, is more faithful than the Griffith & Farran version, though it, too, concocts chapter titles and modifies details. Its text is likewise available at Project Gutenberg.[3]

There are two modern English translations: one byFrank Wynnewith notes by Peter Cogman, published byPenguin Classicsin 2009, and one by Matthew Jonas, published by Birch Hill Publishing in 2022.
