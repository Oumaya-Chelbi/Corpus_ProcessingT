The Adventures of Ferdinand, Count Fathomis anovelbyTobias Smollettfirst published in 1753.  It was Smollett's third novel and met with less success than his two previous more picaresque tales.  The central character is a villainous dandy who cheats, swindles and philanders his way across Europe and England with little concern for the law or the welfare of others.[1]He is the son of an equally disreputable mother, and Smollett himself comments that "Fathom justifies the proverb, 'What's bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh".Sir Walter Scottcommented that the novel paints a "complete picture of human depravity."[2]
