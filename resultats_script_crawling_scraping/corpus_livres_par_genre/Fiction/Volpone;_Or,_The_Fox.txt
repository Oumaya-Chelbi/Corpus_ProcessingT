Volpone(The Fox)is a Venetian gentleman who pretends to be on his deathbed after a long illness in order to dupe Voltore(The Vulture), Corbaccio(The Raven)and Corvino(The Crow), three men who aspire to inherit his fortune. In their turns, each man arrives to Volpone's house bearing a luxurious gift, intent upon having his name inscribed to the will of Volpone, as his heir. Mosca(The Fly), Volpone's parasite servant, encourages each of the visitors to believe that he has been named heir to Volpone's fortune. Mosca even persuades Corbaccio to disinherit his own son in favor of Volpone.

To Volpone, Mosca mentions that Corvino has a beautiful wife, Celia. Disguised as Scoto the Mountebank, Volpone goes to see Celia. Corvino drives away "Scoto" (Volpone), who then becomes insistent that he must possess Celia as his own. Mosca deceives Corvino into believing that the moribund Volpone will be cured of his illness if he lies in bed beside a young woman. Believing that Volpone has been rendered impotent by his illness, Corvino offers his wife in order that, when he is revived, Volpone will recognise Corvino as his sole heir.

Just before Corvino and Celia are due to arrive at Volpone's house, Corbaccio's son Bonario arrives to catch his father in the act of disinheriting him. Mosca guides Bonario to a sideroom, and Volpone and Celia are left alone. Upon failing to seduce Celia with fantastic promises of luxury and wealth, Volpone attempts to rape her. Bonario comes forward to rescue Celia. In the ensuing trial at court, the truth of the matter is well-buried by Voltore, using his prowess as a lawyer to convince the Avocatori, with false evidence given by Mosca, Volpone and the other dupes.

There are episodes involving the English travellers Sir and Lady Politic Would-Be and Peregrine. Sir Politic constantly talks of plots and his outlandish business plans, while Lady Would-Be annoys Volpone with her ceaseless talking. Mosca co-ordinates a mix-up between them which leaves Peregrine, a more sophisticated traveller, feeling offended. He humiliates Sir Politic by telling him he is to be arrested for sedition and making him hide inside a giant tortoise shell.

Volpone insists on disguising himself and having it announced that he has died and willed his wealth to Mosca, which enrages the would-be heirs Voltore, Corbaccio and Corvino, and everyone returns to court to dispute the will of Volpone, who becomes entangled in the circumstances of the plots that he and Mosca devised. Despite Volpone's pleas, Mosca refuses to relinquish his new role as a rich man. Volpone reveals himself and his deceits in order to topple the rich Mosca. In the event, Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca and Volpone himself finally are punished.

The play appeared inquartoin early 1607, printed byGeorge Eldfor publisherThomas Thorpe. The quarto contains Jonson's dedication toOxfordandCambridge, as well as a great number ofcommendatory verses, in English and Latin, by fellow-poets such asFrancis BeaumontandJohn Fletcher. Its next appearance was in thefolioof 1616, and the latter, presumably having been subject to Jonson's careful review, forms the basis of most modern editions.

The play premiered at theGlobe Theatrein Spring 1606. It was performed by theKing's Men, but casting is uncertain.John Lowinmay have performed the title role, as he is associated with the role in James Wright'sHistoria Histrionica(1699).William Giffordhypothesized thatAlexander Cookemay have played Lady Would-be. Either that summer or the next, an outbreak ofplagueclosed the London theatres, and the company performed the play at Oxford and Cambridge. Jonson may have added the first act's satire onPythagorasfor these audiences. The play certainly remained in the King's Men's repertoire throughout the period. It was performed forCharlesin 1624 while he was stillPrince of Wales, in 1630, and again at theCockpit-in-Courtin 1637.

After theRestoration, the play enjoyed a lengthy prominence:John Genestrecords over fifty performances before 1770. John Evelyn saw it performed at the court of Charles II on 16 October 1662. When the theatres reopened, the play was owned by the King's Men ofThomas Killigrew; it was performed atDrury Lanein 1663.Michael Mohunplayed Volpone toHart'sMosca;Katherine Coreyplayed Celia, andRebecca Marshallplayed Lady Would-be. The same cast was seen bySamuel Pepysin 1665.

The play continued in performance throughout the 18th century.Richard Steelementions a performance in a 1709 edition ofTatler. Famous eighteenth-century Volpones includedJames Quin; famous Moscas includedCharles Macklin.Colley Cibberplayed Corvino in his productions; his wife Katherine Shore played Celia, as later didElizabeth Inchbald. As with many other Jacobean plays, Volpone had lost its appeal before the end of the 18th century. Earlier in the century, critics had complained about the improbability of the fifth act, frequently likened to farce, and to Jonson's highly Latinate language. An updated version byGeorge Colman the Elderfailed at Drury Lane in 1771. By the end of the century, the objections appeared insurmountable to producers, and the play fell into disuse.

The play was revived by the Phoenix Society at theLyric Hammersmithin 1921;W. B. Yeatswas in the audience and mentions the production approvingly in a letter toAllan Wade. TheBirmingham Repertory Theatrestaged the play at theMalvernFestival in 1935.

A 1938 production introduced two of the dominant elements of twentieth-century productions: the performance ofDonald Wolfitand animal imagery. Wolfit's dynamic performance in the title role, repeated several times over the next decades, set the standard for modern interpretations of Volpone: Politick's plot was truncated or eliminated, and Mosca (played in 1938 byAlan Wheatley) relegated to a secondary role.

The play has since been staged by a number of famous companies. In 1952,George DevinedirectedAnthony Quayle(Mosca) andRalph Richardson(Volpone) at theStratford Memorial Theatre. At the same theatre in 1955,Eric Porterplayed Volpone. In 1968, SirTyrone Guthrie'sNational Theatreproduction emphasized the beast-fable motif; this production featured stage design byTanya Moiseiwitsch. In the same year, David Raeburn directed a modern dress performance featuring rock music settings of the songs at Beckenham Boys Grammar.

In 1972, the play was staged at theBristol Old Vic. A most memorable production of the 1970s wasPeter Hall's staging for theRoyal National Theatrein 1974, withPaul Scofieldas Volpone,Ben Kingsleyas Mosca, SirJohn Gielgudas Sir Politick, andIan Charlesonas Peregrine. In 1971, theStratford Festivalmounted a Canadian production directed byDavid William, withWilliam Huttin the title role andDouglas Rainas Mosca.[1]

Volponewas adapted byJules RomainsandStefan Zweigin their 1928 production, with the ending changed so that Mosca ends up with Volpone's money. This version was used byGeorge Antheilin his 1953operaVolpone.

In 1941 a French film version was released, under the direction of noted filmmakerMaurice Tourneur. Begun in 1938 byJacques de Baroncelli, the production shut down because of financial difficulties. Tourneur took over and the shooting resumed in 1940. This version also used portions of the adaptation by Romains and Zweig.

The Honey Potis a 1967 film byJoseph L. Mankiewiczbased onVolpone, although with a romantic subplot and sentimental trappings. It featuredRex Harrisonin the main role,Cliff Robertsonas Mosca ("McFly"), andMaggie Smithas the love interest. A portion of the original play is presented in private performance for Harrison's character, who states that it is his favourite.

In France, there have been three further video and DVD adaptations ofVolponebased on versions of the Stefan Zweig/Jules Romains script: in 1978,Jean Meyerdirected a production in the 'théâtre de boulevard' style for the Théâtre de Marigny and Panorama (Au Théâtre ce soir), starring himself as Corbaccio,Jean Le Poulainas Volpone,Francis Husteras Mosca andClaude Jadeas Colomba (Celia). This was followed in 2001 by a production directed byFrancis Perrinwith a script that resembles the Zweig/Romains text but rewritten in pseudo-Elizabethan style by Jean Collette and Toni Cecchinato. Bernard Haller plays the part of Volpone, Francis Perrin plays Mosca, and Thibaut Lorain plays Lady Would-Be. In 2003, the play was rewritten for television byÉric-Emmanuel Schmittfor a production starringGérard Depardieuas Volpone andDaniel Prévostas Mosca. The ending is changed to see Volpone and Mosca escaping together with Corbaccio's wife.
