Dr James Sheppard, the story'snarrator, lives with his unmarried sister, Caroline, in the English country village of King’s Abbot. Telling the story in his own words, Dr Sheppard recounts being called to certify the death of a wealthy widow, Mrs Ferrars, who has committed suicide a year after her abusive husband's demise. Caroline speculates that Mrs Ferrars had poisoned her husband and has committed suicide out of remorse.

Roger Ackroyd, wealthy widower and owner of Fernly Park, tells Dr Sheppard that he needs to talk to him urgently and invites him to dinner that evening. In addition to Dr Sheppard, the dinner guests include Major Blunt, Ackroyd's sister-in-law Mrs Cecil Ackroyd, her daughter Flora, and Ackroyd'spersonal secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. Flora tells the doctor that she is engaged to Ralph Paton, Ackroyd's stepson, though the engagement is being kept confidential.

In his study after dinner, Ackroyd tells Dr Sheppard that he had been engaged to Mrs Ferrars for several months, and that she had admitted the day before that she had indeed poisoned her husband. She was beingblackmailed, and promised to reveal the blackmailer's name within 24 hours. At this point Ackroyd's butler, Parker, enters with a letter that Mrs Ferrars had posted just before she killed herself. Ackroyd apologetically asks Dr Sheppard to leave so that he can read it alone.

Shortly after arriving back home, the doctor receives a phone call. Dr Sheppard tells Caroline that Ackroyd has been found dead and then returns to Fernly Park. Parker professes to know nothing about the phone call. Unable to get a response at the study door, Sheppard and Parker break it down and find Ackroyd dead in his chair, killed with his own dagger. The letter is missing and footprints are found leading in and out of the study through an open window.

Ralph disappears and becomes the primary suspect when the footprints are found to match shoes that he owns. Flora, convinced that Ralph is innocent, asks the recently retired detectiveHercule Poirotto investigate. He agrees and visits the scene of the crime, asking Dr Sheppard to accompany him.

Parker notes to Poirot that a chair in Ackroyd's study has been moved. Poirot questions the guests and staff, including Ursula Bourne, theparlourmaid, who has no alibi. Thewindow of opportunityfor the murderer after Dr Sheppard's departure appears to have been quite short since Raymond and Blunt later heard Ackroyd talking in his study, and Flora says she saw him just before going up to bed.

Poirot unravels a complex web of intrigue, and presents the missing Ralph Paton – who was, it transpires, already secretly married to Ursula when Ackroyd had decided that he should marry Flora. The pair had arranged a clandestine meeting in the garden. Flora is forced to admit she never in fact saw her uncle after dinner, leaving Raymond and Blunt as the last people to hear Ackroyd alive. Blunt confesses his love for Flora.

Alone with Dr Sheppard, Poirot reveals he knows that Dr Sheppard himself is both Ferrars' blackmailer and Ackroyd's killer. Realising that Mrs Ferrars's letter would implicate him, Sheppard had stabbed Ackroyd before leaving the study. He left publicly through the front door, then put Ralph's shoes on, ran round to the study window and climbed back in. Locking the door from the inside, he set adesk dictaphonegoing, playing a recording of Ackroyd's voice, and pulled out a chair to hide it from the sightline of anyone standing in the doorway. To provide the excuse for returning to Fernly Park, he had asked a patient to call him at home. While Sheppard had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered, he slipped the dictaphone into hismedical bag, and put the chair back in place. These details were concealed from his narrative, which has also now been given to Poirot.

Poirot tells Dr Sheppard the matter will be reported to the police in the morning and suggests he spare his sister Caroline by taking his own life. Sheppard completes his account of Poirot's investigation – the novel itself – with the final chapter,Apologia, serving as his suicide note.

The novel is narrated by Dr James Sheppard, who becomes Poirot's assistant, in place ofCaptain Hastingswho has married and settled inthe Argentine. It includes an unexpectedplot twisttowards the end, when Dr Sheppard reveals he has throughout been anunreliable narrator, using literary techniques to conceal his guilt without writing anything untrue (e.g., "I did what little had to be done" at the point where he slipped the dictaphone into his bag and moved the chair).

The review inThe Times Literary Supplementbegan, "This is a well-written detective story of which the only criticism might perhaps be that there are too many curious incidents not really connected with the crime which have to be elucidated before the true criminal can be discovered". The review concluded, "It is all very puzzling, but the great Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian detective, solves the mystery. It may safely be asserted that very few readers will do so."[10]

A long review inThe New York Times Book Reviewread in part:

The Observerhad high praise for the novel, especially the character Caroline:

The Scotsmanfound the plot to be clever and original:

Howard Haycraft,[14]in his 1941 work,Murder for Pleasure, included the novel in his "cornerstones" list of the most influential crime novels ever written.[13]

The English crime writer and criticRobert Barnard, inA Talent to Deceive: An appreciation of Agatha Christie, wrote that this novel is "Apart—and it is an enormous 'apart'—from the sensational solution, this is a fairly conventional Christie." He concluded that this is "A classic, but there are some better [novels by] Christie."[6]

John Goddard wrote an  analysis of whether Christie 'cheats' with her sensational solution and concluded that the charge of cheating fails.[12]

In a biography of Christie, Laura Thompson argued thatThe Murder of Roger Ackroydwas the ultimate detective novel:

In 1944–1946, the American literary criticEdmund Wilsonattacked the entire mystery genre in a set of three columns inThe New Yorker. The second, in the 20 January 1945 issue, was titled "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?", though he does no analysis of the novel. He dislikes mystery stories altogether, and chose the famous novel as the title of his piece.[16][17]

In 1990,The Murder of Roger Ackroydcame in at fifth place inThe Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a ranking by the members (all crime writers) of theCrime Writers' Associationin Britain.[8]A similar ranking was made in 1995 by theMystery Writers of America, putting this novel in twelfth place.[9]

Literature professor and authorPierre Bayard, in the 1998 workQui a tué Roger Ackroyd?(Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?), re-investigates Agatha Christie'sAckroyd, proposing an alternative solution in another crime novel. He argues in favour of a different murderer – Sheppard's sister, Caroline – and says Christie subconsciously knew who the real culprit is.[18][19]

In 1999, the novel was included in French newspaperLe Monde's list of the100 Books of the Century, chosen by readers from a list of 200.[20]

In 2013, theCrime Writers' Associationvoted the novel as CWA Best Ever Novel.[7]The 600 members of CWA said it was "the finest example of the genre ever penned." It is a cornerstone of crime fiction, which "contains one of the most celebrated plot twists in crime writing history."[7][21]The poll taken on the 60th anniversary of CWA also honoured Agatha Christie as the best crime novel author ever.[7][21]

In the "Binge!" article ofEntertainment WeeklyIssue #1343–44 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers pickedThe Murder of Roger Ackroydas an "EW and Christie favorite" on the list of the "Nine Great Christie Novels".[22]

The character of Caroline Sheppard was later acknowledged by Christie as a possible precursor to her famous detectiveMiss Marple.[23]: 433

Christie revealed in her 1977 autobiography that the basic idea of the novel was given to her by her brother-in-law, James Watts ofAbney Hall, who suggested a novel in which the criminal would be aDr Watsoncharacter, which Christie considered to be a "remarkably original thought".[23]: 342

In March 1924 Christie also received an unsolicited letter fromLord Louis Mountbatten. He had been impressed with her previous works and wrote, courtesy ofThe Sketchmagazine (publishers of many of her short stories at that time) with an idea and notes for a story whose basic premise mirrored the Watts suggestion.[15]: 500Christie acknowledged the letter and after some thought, began to write the book but to a plot line of her invention. She also acknowledged taking inspiration from the infamous case of the unsolved death ofCharles Bravo, who she thought had been murdered by DrJames Manby Gully.[24]

In December 1969 Mountbatten wrote to Christie again after having seen a performance ofThe Mousetrap. He mentioned his letter of the 1920s, and Christie replied, acknowledging the part he played in the conception of the book.[25]: 120–121

The story first appeared as a fifty-four part serialisation in theLondon Evening Newsfrom Thursday, 16 July, to Wednesday, 16 September 1925 under the titleWho Killed Ackroyd?In the United States, the story was serialised in four parts inFlynn's Detective Weeklyfrom 19 June (Volume 16, Number 2) to 10 July 1926 (Volume 16, Number 5). The text was heavily abridged and each instalment carried an uncredited illustration.

The Collins first edition of June 1926 (retailing for seven shillings and sixpence)[2]was Christie's first work placed with that publisher. "The first book that Agatha wrote for Collins was the one that changed her reputation forever; no doubt she knew, as through 1925 she turned the idea over in her mind, that here she had a winner."[15]: 155The first United States publisher was The Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 19 June 1926 (retailing at $2.00).[3]

By 1928,The Murder of Roger Ackroydwas available inbraillethrough the UK'sRoyal National Institute for the Blind[26]and was among the first works to be chosen for transfer toGramophone recordfor theirBooks for the Blindlibrary in the autumn of 1935.[27][28]By 1936 it was listed as one of only eight books available in this form.[29]

Christie's dedication in the book reads "To Punkie, who likes an orthodox detective story, murder, inquest, and suspicion falling on every one in turn!"

"Punkie" was the family nickname of Christie's sister and eldest sibling, Margaret ("Madge") Frary Watts (1879–1950). Despite their eleven-year age gap, the sisters remained close throughout their lives. Christie's mother first suggested to her that she should alleviate the boredom of an illness by writing a story. But soon after, when the sisters had been discussing the recently published classic detective story byGaston Leroux,The Mystery of the Yellow Room(1908), Christie said she would like to try writing such a story. Margaret challenged her, saying that she would not be able to do it.[15]: 102In 1916, eight years later, Christie remembered this conversation and was inspired to write her first novel,The Mysterious Affair at Styles.[25]: 77

Margaret Watts wrote a play,The Claimant, based on theTichborne Case, which enjoyed a short run in the West End at theQueen's Theatrefrom 11 September to 18 October 1924, two years before the book publication ofThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd.[25]: 113–115

The book formed the basis of the earliest adaptation of any work of Christie's when the play,Alibi, adapted byMichael Morton, opened at thePrince of Wales Theatrein London on 15 May 1928. It ran for 250 performances withCharles Laughtonas Poirot. Laughton also starred in the Broadway run of the play, retitledThe Fatal Alibi,which opened at theBooth Theatreon 8 February 1932. The American production was not as successful and closed after just 24 performances.Alibiinspired Christie to write her first stage play,Black Coffee. Christie, with her dog Peter, attended the rehearsals ofAlibiand found its "novelty" enjoyable.[15]: 277However, "she was sufficiently irritated by the changes to the original to want to write a play of her own."[15]: 277

In 2023, the novel was adapted for the stage by Edgar award nominated playwrightMark Shanahan[32]in partnership with Agatha Christie, Ltd.[33]The play received its first public reading at theWestport Country Playhousein June 2023 with Santino Fontana as Dr. Sheppard and Arnie Burton as Poirot.[34]Shortly thereafter, the world premiere production directed by Mark Shanahan opened at theAlley Theatrein Houston, Texas[35]and featured the Alley's resident company of actors with David Sinaiko as Poirot. The Houston Chronicle reviewed the play, calling it "a whodunnit done right. This world premiere adaptation elegantly transfers Christie’s rich mystery from the page to the stage..."[36]The play opened on 21 July and ran through 27 August in a limited run as part of the Alley Theatre's Summer Chills series[37]and was subsequently published by Concord Theatricals[38]before receiving numerous productions. The adaptation remains mostly faithful to the book, with Shanahan stating that crafting the adaptation was a "labour of love."[39]

The play was turned into the first sound film based on a Christie work. Running 75 minutes, it was released on 28 April 1931, by Twickenham Film Studios and produced by Julius S. Hagan.Austin Trevorplayed Poirot, a role he reprised later that year in the film adaptation of Christie's 1930 play,Black Coffee.Alibiis considered to be alost film.

Orson Wellesadapted the novel as a one-hourradio playfor the 12 November 1939 episode ofThe Campbell Playhouse. Welles played both Dr Sheppard and Hercule Poirot. The play was adapted byHerman J. Mankiewicz,[40]: 355[41]produced by Welles and John Houseman, and directed by Welles.
