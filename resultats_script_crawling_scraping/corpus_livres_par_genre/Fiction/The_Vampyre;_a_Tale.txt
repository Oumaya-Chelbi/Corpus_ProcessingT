Aubrey meets the mysterious Lord Ruthven at a social event when he comes to London. After briefly getting to know Ruthven, Aubrey agrees to go travelling around Europe with him. Aubrey slowly realizes that Ruthven delights in causing the ruin and degradation of others, and after Ruthven attempts to seduce the daughter of a mutual acquaintance near Rome, Aubrey leaves in disgust. Alone, Aubrey travels to Greece where he falls in love with an innkeeper's daughter, Ianthe. She tells him about the legends of the vampire, which are very popular in the area, and Aubrey recognises that Ruthven fits the physical description.

This romance is short-lived: Ianthe is killed, her throat torn open by an attacker who injures Aubrey and leaves behind an unusual dagger. The whole town believes it to be the work of an evil vampire. Aubrey falls ill, but is found and nursed back to health by Ruthven. Although suspicious of the man, Aubrey feels obliged to Ruthven and rejoins him in his travels. The pair are attacked by bandits on the road and Ruthven is mortally wounded. On his deathbed, Ruthven makes Aubrey swear an oath that he will not speak of Ruthven or his death for a year and a day, and once Aubrey agrees, Lord Ruthven dies laughing. Amongst Ruthven's belongings Aubrey discovers a sheath which matches the dagger found by Ianthe's body.

Aubrey returns to London and is amazed when Ruthven appears shortly thereafter, alive and well. Ruthven reminds Aubrey of his oath and although Aubrey wants to warn others of Ruthven's character he feels unable to break his oath. Helpless to protect his sister from Ruthven, Aubrey has a nervous breakdown. Upon recovering, Aubrey learns that Ruthven has inherited an earldom and is engaged to his sister, and they are due to be married on the day that his oath will end. Unable to delay the wedding, Aubrey has a stroke. That night, his oath expires, and Aubrey relates the entire story before dying. But it is too late: Ruthven has disappeared, leaving his new wife dead and drained of blood.

"The Vampyre" was first published on 1 April 1819 byHenry Colburnin theNew Monthly Magazinewith the false attribution "A Tale byLord Byron".[4]The name of the work's protagonist, "Lord Ruthven", added to this assumption, for that name was originally used inLady Caroline Lamb's novelGlenarvon(from the same publisher), in which a thinly-disguised Byron figure was named Clarence de Ruthven, Earl of Glenarvon. Despite repeated denials by Byron and Polidori, the authorship often went unclarified. In the following issue, dated May 1, 1819, Polidori wrote a letter to the editor explaining "that though the groundwork is certainly Lord Byron's, its development is mine".[5]

The tale was first published in book form by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones in London, Paternoster-Row, in 1819 inoctavoasThe Vampyre; A Talein 84 pages. The notation on the cover noted that it was: "Entered at Stationers' Hall, March 27, 1819". Once again, the author was given as Lord Byron on the title page. After Polidori protested, later printings removed Byron's name from the title page but did not replace it with Polidori's.[6]

The story was an immediate popular success, partly because of the Byron attribution and partly because it exploited thegothichorror predilections of the public. Polidori transformed the vampire from a character infolkloreinto the form that is recognized today—an aristocratic fiend who preys among high society.[3]Due to this influential aspect, Jan Čapek argued that "Ruthven’s excesses in Polidori’s tale reveal the landscape of modern, increasingly capitalistic class society to be laden with anxiety concerning the continuing power of the aristocracy, as though untouched by the social shifts in the wake of the industrial revolution."[7]

The story has its genesis in the summer of 1816, theYear Without a Summer, when Europe and parts ofNorth Americaunderwent a severeclimateabnormality.Lord Byronand his young physician John Polidori were staying at theVilla DiodatibyLake Genevaand were visited byPercy Bysshe Shelley,Mary Shelley, andClaire Clairmont. Kept indoors by the "incessant rain" of that "wet, ungenial summer",[8]over three days in June the five turned to telling fantastical tales, and then writing their own. Fueled by ghost stories such as theFantasmagoriana,William Beckford'sVathek, and quantities oflaudanum, Mary Shelley[9]produced what would becomeFrankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus. Polidori was inspired by a fragmentary story of Byron's, "Fragment of a Novel" (1816), also known as "A Fragment" and "The Burial: A Fragment", and in "two or three idle mornings" produced "The Vampyre".[10]While most scholars pursue Polidori's proximity to Byron as a decisive factor, Jan Čapek warns against a "Byromaniacal" reading of the tale, arguing that "such an infection of the discussion about Polidori with the germ of Byron’s controversial persona is somewhat paradoxical, considering that the resulting debate oscillates somewhere between a sense that Polidori’s conception itself reflects his own sense of the debilitating domination of Byron’s genius and a
sense that Polidori attempted to take control in defence against such domination and wrote the tale in an attempt to satirize the effects of Byron’s proximity and to assert his own worth."[11]

Polidori's work had an immense impact on contemporary sensibilities and ran through numerous editions and translations. Jan Čapek argued that:

That influence has extended into the current era as the text is seen as "canonical" and – together withBram Stoker'sDraculaand others – is "often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism".[2]An adaptation appeared in 1820 with Cyprien Bérard's novelLord Ruthwen ou les Vampires, falsely attributed toCharles Nodier, who himself then wrote his own dramatic version,Le Vampire, a play which had enormous success and sparked a "vampire craze" across Europe. This includesoperaticadaptations byHeinrich Marschner(seeDer Vampyr) andPeter Josef von Lindpaintner(seeDer Vampyr), both published in the same year.Nikolai Gogol,Alexandre DumasandAleksey Tolstoyall produced vampire tales, and themes in Polidori's tale would continue to influenceBram Stoker'sDraculaand eventually the whole vampire genre. Dumas makes explicit reference to Lord Ruthven inThe Count of Monte Cristo, going so far as to state that his character "The Comtesse G..." had been personally acquainted with Lord Ruthven.[13]

In 1819,The Black Vampyre, an American novella by Uriah D'Arcy, was published, taking advantage ofThe Vampyre's popularity.[14]

In 2016, it was announced that the studio Britannia Pictures would be releasing a feature-length adaptation ofThe Vampyre. Production for the film was slated to begin in late 2018, with filming taking place in the UK, Italy and Greece.[15]The film would be directed by Rowan M. Ashe and was scheduled for release in October 2019.[16]

Earlier adaptations of Polidori's story include the 1945 filmThe Vampire's GhoststarringJohn Abbottas the Lord Ruthven character "Webb Fallon", with the setting changed from England and Greece to Africa.[17]Also,The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, based on the operaDer VampyrbyHeinrich Marschnerand the Polidori story, was filmed and broadcast onBBC 2on December 2, 1992, with the Lord Ruthven character's name changed to "Ripley", who is frozen in the late eighteenth century but revives in modern times and becomes a successful businessman.[18]

In England,James Planché's playThe Vampire, or The Bride of the Isleswas first performed in London in 1820 at theLyceum Theatre[19]based onCharles Nodier'sLe Vampire, which in turn was based on Polidori.[20]Such melodramas were satirised inRuddigore, byGilbert and Sullivan(1887), in which a character called Sir Ruthven must abduct a maiden, or he will die.[21]

In 1988, American playwright Tim Kelly created a drawing room adaptation ofThe Vampyrefor the stage, popular among community theatres and high school drama clubs.[22]
