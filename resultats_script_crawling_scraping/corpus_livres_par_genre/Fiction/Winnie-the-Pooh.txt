Winnie-the-Poohis a 1926 children's book by English authorA. A. Milneand English illustratorE. H. Shepard. The book is set in the fictionalHundred Acre Wood, with a collection of short stories following the adventures of an anthropomorphicteddy bear,Winnie-the-Pooh, and his friendsChristopher Robin,Piglet,Eeyore,Owl,Rabbit,Kanga, andRoo. It is the first of two story collections by Milne about Winnie-the-Pooh, the second beingThe House at Pooh Corner(1928). Milne and Shepard collaborated previously for English humour magazinePunch, and in 1924 createdWhen We Were Very Young, a poetry collection. Among the characters in the poetry book was a teddy bear Shepard modelled after his son's toy. Following this, Shepard encouraged Milne to write about his sonChristopher Robin Milne's toys, and so they became the inspiration for the characters inWinnie-the-Pooh.
