The story describes a young woman and her husband. He imposes arest cureon her when she suffers "temporary nervous depression" after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery.  The story makes striking use of anunreliable narratorin order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has "imprisoned" her due to her physical and mental condition. She describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor "scratched and gouged and splintered", a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all these on children who must have resided there.

The narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room – its "sickly" color, its "yellow" smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like "an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions," its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design. Eventually, she comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must free the woman in the wallpaper, she begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.

When her husband arrives home, the narrator refuses to unlock her door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming, "I've got out at last... in spite of you."  He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.

Charlotte Perkins Gilmanused her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expounded upon many issues, such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of apatriarchal society. Through her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such asAlice WalkerandSylvia Plath.[5]

In "The Yellow Wallpaper," she portrays the narrator's insanity as a way to protest the professional and societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally fragile.Women’s rightsadvocates of the era believed that the "outbreak" of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing because it would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of expression for women at a time when they had very few rights.[5]

After the birth of her first daughter, Gilman suffered postnatal depression and was treated byDr. Silas Weir Mitchell, the leading expert on women's mental health at the time. He suggested a strict 'rest cure' regimen involving much of bed rest and a blanket ban on working, including reading, writing, and painting. After three months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to a complete mental breakdown, the author wrote "The Yellow Wallpaper" with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her criticism of the medical field. Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain for the "rest cure" when she sought a second opinion fromMary Putnam Jacobi, one of the first female doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that proved a much more successful treatment.[6])

She added that "The Yellow Wallpaper" was "not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked". Gilman claimed that many years later, she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods. However, literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 – 16 years after "The Yellow Wallpaper" was published – was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the "rest cure" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.[7][citation needed]

This story has been interpreted byfeminist criticsas a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century medical profession.[8]Throughout the short story, the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better, such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world.  Her ideas are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her condition. This interpretation draws on the concept of the "domestic sphere" that women were held in during this period.[9]

Many feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman's assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt trapped.[10]The emphasis on reading and writing asgendered practicesalso illustrated the importance of the wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to "read" the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over her husband at the expense of her sanity.

Susan S. Lanser, a professor atBrandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature. "The Yellow Wallpaper" was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works' content to be disturbing or offensive. Critics such as the editor of theAtlantic Monthlyrejected the short story because "[he] could not forgive [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself]". Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work ofEdgar Allan Poe.[11]"The Yellow Wallpaper" provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a "particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision... because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall".[11]The narrator in the story is trying to find a single meaning in the wallpaper.  At first, she focuses on the contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is "flamboyant" while also "dull", "pronounced," yet "lame," and "uncertain" (p. 13).  She takes into account the patterns and tries to organize them geometrically, but she is further confused.  The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor that the protagonist cannot recognize (p. 25). At night the narrator can see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find "a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection".[11]Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a single meaning. "How we were taught to read," as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text.[11]The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as "The Yellow Wallpaper".  With the growth of feminist criticism, "The Yellow Wallpaper" has become a standard text in many curricula. Feminists have made a significant contribution to the study of literature, according to Lanser, but she also remarks that if "we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked."[11]

Martha J. Cutter points out that many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works address a "struggle in which a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women".[12]Gilman's works challenge the social construction of women by a patriarchal medical discourse that forced them to be "silent, powerless, and passive".[12]In the period in which Gilman wrote, women were frequently considered (and treated) as inferiors, prone to be sickly and weak. In this time period, it was thought that women who received formal education (amongst other causes) could develophysteria, a now-discredited[13]catchall term referring to most mental health diseases identified in women and erroneously believed to stem from a malfunctioning uterus (from the Greekhystera, "womb"). At the time, the medical understanding was that women who spent time in serious intellectual pursuits (such as university education) over-stimulated their brains, which in turn led to states of hysteria. Many of the diseases diagnosed in women were considered to be a matter of a lack of self-control or self-rule. Medical practitioners argued that a physician must "assume a tone of authority" and that a "cured" woman is defined by being "subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician".[12]A hysterical woman craves power. To be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician, whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to "tame" them and keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for women, i.e., "the rest cure", has to do with how her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains: "In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public.... It is a male voice that... imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's."[14]The narrator in "The Yellow Wallpaper" is not allowed to participate in her treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one which forces control on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.[citation needed]

“The Yellow Wallpaper” often resembles a sub-category framework called ecogothic literature.Ecogothicis a relatively new literary and critical framework that explores the intersection of ecological concerns and Gothic tropes, particularly fear, dread, and the uncanny in representations of nature. Emerging prominently with the 2013 volumeEcogothicedited by Andrew Smith and William Hughes, the field builds upon earlier discussions, notably Simon C. Estok’s 2009 essay on ecophobia. A central concept in ecogothic isecophobia—the fear or contempt for nature—which is seen as foundational to the genre. Scholars like Dawn Keetley and Matthew Wynn Sivils emphasize that ecogothic literature reflects a deep anxiety stemming from humanity’s failure to control nature, aligning ecological fear with traditional Gothic themes of loss, powerlessness, and the unknown.

Through an ecogothic lens, "The Yellow Wallpaper" reveals how the natural world and the domestic environment become sites of psychological horror and oppression. The story reflects key ecogothic themes, particularly ecophobia which mirrors the protagonist’s growing fear of her surroundings and her deteriorating mental state. The room she is confined to, with its grotesque wallpaper, becomes a symbol of “human agency and a dislocation from ambulant human status…” Nature outside the house is present but unreachable, emphasizing the protagonist’s disconnection from both the natural world and her own autonomy. As her sense of control unravels, so does the barrier between the rational and the irrational—central concerns in both gothic and ecogothic narratives. Ultimately, the story illustrates how oppressive social structures and fear of the uncontrollable—whether within the mind or in the environment—intertwine to create a haunting, ecogothic atmosphere.

"The Yellow Wallpaper" portrays a chilling entanglement of patriarchal violence, nature, and suppressed agency. John's desperate cry for an axe evokes not only domestic violence but also ecological destruction, linking the felling of trees to the silencing of women. The wallpaper—layered with remnants of a violently ended life—symbolizes both a barrier to liberation and a site of resistance. As the narrator emerges from the wallpaper, her act disrupts the walls that traditionally signify civilization and control, revealing the haunting histories hidden within domestic spaces. This ecogothic reading underscores how vegetal and feminine agency are suppressed by a civilization that is deeply complicit in erasing both, suggesting that madness becomes a form of rebellion against the silencing forces of patriarchy and ecophobia.

Through the lens of Gilbert and Gubar’s theory, the story becomes a feminist indictment of the systemic silencing of women. The narrator’s collapse is not caused solely by mental illness, but by a world that refuses to allow her any control over her body, her mind, or her surroundings. The final scene, in which she “creeps” over the unconscious body of her husband, is a powerful inversion of power — but it is also tragic, a descent into madness as the only way to reclaim a fragmented identity.

The themes in “The Yellow Wallpaper” parallel those in Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”, where protagonist Esther Greenwood similarly feels suffocated by societal expectations and gender norms. Esther’s internal conflict between her ambitions and traditional female roles leads her to contemplate — and attempt — suicide. Both protagonists are highly intelligent, emotionally sensitive women pushed to the edge by institutions that claim to know what’s best for them. Like Gilman’s narrator, Esther has no true outlet for her distress; she writes, “The silence depressed me. It wasn’t the silence of silence. It was my own silence” (Plath 20).

In both works, the female psyche is examined in isolation — one trapped in a colonial mansion, the other in the metaphorical “bell jar.” Esther, like the narrator ofThe Yellow Wallpaper, experiences a deepening dissociation between mind and body. She becomes alienated from her own image, even fantasizing about an alternate identity as “Elly Higginbottom” to escape her life. Her rejection of conventional femininity, and of marriage to Buddy Willard — a man who, like John, expects subservience and domesticity — echoes Gilman’s critique of patriarchal roles.

Each protagonist’s path toward breakdown is also shaped by theFoucauldiannotion of the medical gaze — the way institutions view mental illness through an impersonal, diagnostic lens that discounts lived experience. Esther’s traumatic electroshock treatment at the hands of Dr. Gordon mirrors the emotional trauma of the rest cure for Gilman’s narrator. Both women find some semblance of healing only through subversive action: tearing the wallpaper or rewriting their lives in fiction.

"The Yellow Wallpaper" is sometimes cited as an example ofGothic literaturefor its themes of madness and powerlessness.[15]Alan Ryan introduced the story by writing: "quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, and strongest, tales ofhorrorever written. It may be aghost story. Worse yet, it may not."[16]Pioneering horror authorH. P. Lovecraftwrites in his essaySupernatural Horror in Literature(1927) that "'The Yellow Wall Paper' rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a madwoman was once confined".[17]

Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz wrote that "the story was acri de coeuragainst Gilman's first husband, artistCharles Walter Stetsonand the traditional marriage he had demanded."[18]Gilman attempted to deflect blame to protect her daughter Katharine and Stetson's second wifeGrace Ellery Channing, who was also Gilman's close friend and cousin.[19]Horowitz consults the sources of Charlotte's private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte's diaries for notes on her reading. She shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. Horowitz makes a case that "The Yellow Wallpaper", in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (a neurologist who treated Gilman in 1887) and his treatment. Rather, it emerged from Charlotte's troubled relationship with her husband Walter, personified in the story's physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.

In another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that "The Yellow Wallpaper" is an allegory for Gilman's hatred of the emergingyellow journalism. Having createdThe Forerunnerin November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented thesensationalismof the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship with the press. The protagonist describes the wallpaper as having "sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin". Edelstein argues that given Gilman’s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.[20]

Paula A. Treichler focuses on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of "...the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation ofneurasthenia, the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy", Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the "...sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes". While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse. The woman found in the wallpaper could be the "...representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak". In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported by the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is why her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.[14]

Gilman was a major feminist figure during the turn of the 20th century. However, according to the Natural Library of Medicine, Gilman was considered aneugenicist.[21]Eugenics, in simple terms, is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of the population. This belief system that skyrocketed at the turn of the century and is heavily rooted inracism,xenophobia,antisemitism,ableism, and more.  Despite these beliefs, she is a big face of feminist literature and scholars are aware of her troubling ideologies while still acknowledging her role in the feminist movement at the time.
