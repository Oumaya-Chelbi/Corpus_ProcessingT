Viola is shipwrecked on the coast ofIllyriaand comes ashore with a captain's help. She has lost contact with her twin brother, Sebastian, who she believes has drowned, and with the aid of the Captain, she disguises herself as a young man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino. Orsino has convinced himself he is in love with Olivia, who is mourning her brother's recent death. Olivia refuses to see entertainments, be in the company of men, or accept love or marriage proposals from anyone, including Orsino, until seven years have passed. Orsino then uses 'Cesario' as an intermediary to profess his passionate love for Olivia. But Olivia falls in love with 'Cesario', setting her at odds with her professed duty. Meanwhile, Viola has fallen in love with Orsino, creating a love triangle: Viola loves Orsino, Orsino loves Olivia, and Olivia loves Viola disguised as Cesario.

In the comic subplot, several characters conspire to make Olivia's pompous steward, Malvolio, believe that she has fallen for him. This involves Olivia's riotous uncle, Sir Toby Belch; another would-be suitor, the silly squire Sir Andrew Aguecheek; Olivia's servants Maria and Fabian; and Olivia's witty fool, Feste. Sir Toby and Sir Andrew engage themselves in drinking and revelry, disrupting the peace of Olivia's household until late into the night, prompting Malvolio to chastise them. Sir Toby famously retorts,

Maria suggests taking revenge on Malvolio by convincing him that Olivia is secretly in love with him. She forges a love letter, mimicking Olivia's handwriting, and plants it in the garden. The letter asks Malvolio to wear yellow stockings cross-gartered—a colour and fashion that Olivia hates, to be rude to the rest of the servants, and to smile constantly in Olivia's presence. Watched by Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian, Malvolio finds the letter and is surprised and delighted. He starts following the letter's instructions to show Olivia his feelings. Olivia is shocked by the changes in him and, agreeing that he seems mad, leaves him to be cared for by his tormentors. Pretending that Malvolio is insane, the tormentors lock him in a dark chamber. Feste visits Malvolio to mock Malvolio's professed insanity, both as himself and disguised as a priest.

Meanwhile, Viola's twin, Sebastian, has been rescued by Antonio, a sea captain who previously fought Orsino, yet who accompanies Sebastian to Illyria, despite the danger, because of his admiration for Sebastian.

With their love for practical jokes, Sir Toby and Fabian convince Sir Andrew to challenge Cesario to a duel, knowing that neither of them can fight. Their initial duel is interrupted by Antonio, who believes Cesario to be Sebastian. Orsino's officers then arrest Antonio. Emboldened by this, Sir Andrew mistakes Sebastian for Cesario and slaps him, prompting Sebastian to beat up Sir Andrew. Olivia witnesses the skirmish and chastises Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian. Taking Sebastian for 'Cesario', Olivia asks him to marry her, and they are secretly married in a church. Finally, when 'Cesario' and Sebastian appear in the presence of both Olivia and Orsino, there is more wonder and confusion at their physical similarity. At this point, Viola reveals her identity and is reunited with her brother.

Sebastian and Viola reunite, and the cases of mistaken identity are resolved. Orsino and Viola marry (Orsino to Viola: "But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen"[2]), and Antonio is released. Fabian confesses the plot against Malvolio, and reveals that Sir Toby has married Maria. Malvolio swears revenge on his tormentors and stalks off, but Orsino sends Fabian to placate him. The plays end with a song sung by Feste.

Illyria, the exotic setting ofTwelfth Night, is important to the play's romantic atmosphere.

Illyria was an ancient region of the Western Balkans whose coast (the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, the only part of ancient Illyria relevant to the play) covered (from north to south) the coasts of modern-daySlovenia,Croatia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Montenegro, andAlbania. It included the city-state of theRepublic of Ragusa, which has been proposed as the setting, and which is today known asDubrovnik,Croatia.[3]

Illyria may have been suggested by the Roman comedyMenaechmi, the plot of which also involves twins who are mistaken for each other. Illyria is also referred to as a site of pirates in Shakespeare's earlier play,Henry VI, Part 2.Most of the characters' names are Italian but some of the comic characters have English names. Oddly, the "Illyrian" lady Olivia has an English uncle, Sir Toby Belch.

It has been noted that the play's setting has other English allusions, such as Viola's use of "Westward ho!", a typical cry of 16th-century London boatmen, and Antonio's recommendation to Sebastian of "The Elephant" as the best place to lodge in Illyria (The Elephantwas a pub not far from the Globe Theatre).[4]

The play is believed to have drawn extensively on the Italian productionGl'ingannati(The Deceived Ones),[5]collectively written by theAccademia degli IntronatiofSienain 1531. It is conjectured that the name of its male lead, Orsino, was suggested byVirginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, an Italian nobleman who visited London in the winter of 1600–01.[6]

Another source story, "Of Apollonius and Silla", appeared inBarnabe Riche's collectionRiche his Farewell to Militarie Profession conteining verie pleasaunt discourses fit for a peaceable tyme(1581), which in turn derives from a story byMatteo Bandello.[7]

"Twelfth Night" is a reference to the twelfth night afterChristmas Day, also called theEve of theFeast of Epiphany. It was originally a Catholic holiday, and these were sometimes occasions for revelry, like other Christian feast days. Servants often dressed up as their masters, men as women, and so forth. This history of festive ritual and carnivalesque reversal[a]is the cultural origin of the play's gender-confusion-driven plot. Puritans often opposed Epiphany celebrations, much as Malvolio opposes the revelry in the play.[8]

The actual Elizabethanfestival of Twelfth Nightinvolved the antics of aLord of Misrule, who, before leaving his temporary position of authority, called for entertainment, songs, andmummery; the play has been regarded as preserving this festive and traditional atmosphere of licensed disorder.[9]: 153This leads to the general inversion of the order of things, most notably gender roles.[9]: 227The embittered and isolated Malvolio can be regarded as an adversary of festive enjoyment and community.[9]: 254That community is led by Sir Toby Belch, "the vice-regent spokesman for cakes and ale", and his partner in a comic stock duo, the simple and constantly exploited Sir Andrew Aguecheek.[10]

The full title of the play isTwelfth Night, or What You Will.Subtitlesfor plays were fashionable in theElizabethan era, and though some editors placeThe Merchant of Venice's alternative title,The Jew of Venice, as a subtitle, this is the only Shakespeare play to bear one when first published.[11]

The play was probably finished between 1600 and 1601, a period suggested by the play's referencing of events that happened during that time. A law student,John Manningham, who was studying in the Middle Temple in London, described the performance on 2 February 1602 (Candlemas) which took place in the hall of the Middle Temple at the formal end of Christmastide in the year's calendar, and to which students were invited.[12]This was the first recorded public performance of the play. The play was not published until its inclusion in theFirst Folioin 1623.

Viola is not alone among Shakespeare's cross-dressing heroines; in Shakespeare's theatre, convention dictated that adolescent boys play female characters, creating humour in the multiplicity of disguise found in a female character who for a while pretended at masculinity.[11]Her cross-dressing enables Viola to fulfil usually male roles, such as acting as a messenger between Orsino and Olivia or serving as Orsino's confidant. But she does not use her disguise to intervene directly in the plot (unlike other Shakespearean heroines, such as Rosalind inAs You Like Itand Portia inThe Merchant of Venice), remaining someone who allows "Time" to untangle the plot.[13]

AsTwelfth Nightexplores gender identity and sexual attraction, having a male actor play Viola enhanced the impression of androgyny and sexual ambiguity.[14]Some modern scholars believe thatTwelfth Night, with the added confusion of male actors and Viola's deception, addresses gender issues "with particular immediacy".[15]They also accept that its depiction of gender stems from the era's prevalent scientific theory that females are simply imperfect males.[14]This belief explains the almost indistinguishable differences between the sexes reflected in the play's casting and characters.

At Olivia's first meeting with "Cesario" (Viola) in Act I, Scene v she asks her "Are you a comedian?" (an Elizabethan term for "actor").[16]Viola's reply, "I am not that I play", epitomising her adoption of the role of "Cesario" (Viola), is regarded as one of the play's several references to theatricality and "playing".[17]The plot against Malvolio revolves around these ideas, and Fabian remarks in Act III, Scene iv: "If this were play'd upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction".[18]In Act IV, Scene ii, Feste (The Fool) plays both parts in the "play" for Malvolio's benefit, alternating between adopting the voice of the localcurate, Sir Topas, and his own voice. He finishes by likening himself to "the old Vice" of English Morality plays.[19]Other influences of the English folk tradition can be seen in Feste's songs and dialogue, such as his final song in Act V.[20]The last line of this song, "And we'll strive to please you every day", echoes similar lines from several English folk plays.[21]

Some scholars argue thatTwelfth Night, or What You Will(the play's full title) was probably commissioned for performance as part of the Twelfth Night celebrations held byQueen Elizabeth IatWhitehall Palaceon 6 January 1601 to mark the end of the embassy of the Italian diplomat, the Duke of Orsino.[22]Others dispute this, arguing that the "rigid etiquette of Queen Elizabeth's court" would have made it "impossible" for Shakespeare to name a main character in a comedy for the very diplomat attending the performance, and that it is more likely that Shakespeare used the name from the 1601 diplomatic visit when writing his play, which premiered the next winter.[23]It was again performed at Court on Easter Monday in 1618 and onCandlemasnight in 1623.

The earliest public performance took place atMiddle Temple Hall, one of theInns of Court, on 2 February (Candlemas night) 1602. The lawyerJohn Manninghamwrote in his diary:

Clearly, Manningham enjoyed the Malvolio story most of all, and noted the play's similarity to Shakespeare's earlier play, as well as its relationship with one of its sources, theInganniplays.

The play was one of the earliest Shakespearean works acted at the start of theRestoration; SirWilliam Davenant's adaptation was staged in 1661, withThomas Bettertonas Sir Toby Belch.Samuel Pepysthought it "a silly play", but saw it three times anyway during the period of his diary on 11 September 1661, 6 January 1663, and 20 January 1669. Another adaptation,Love Betray'd, or, The Agreeable Disappointment, was acted atLincoln's Inn Fieldsin 1703.[6]

After holding the stage only in the adaptations in the late 17th century and early 18th century, the original Shakespearean text ofTwelfth Nightwas revived in 1741, in a production atDrury Lane. In 1820 an operatic version byFrederic Reynoldswas staged, with music byHenry Bishop.

Influential productions were staged in 1912, byHarley Granville-Barker, and in 1916, at theOld Vic.

Lilian Baylisreopened the long-dormantSadler's Wells Theatrein 1931 with a notable production of the play starringRalph Richardsonas Sir Toby andJohn Gielgudas Malvolio. TheOld Vic Theatrewas reopened in 1950 (after suffering severe damage in theLondon Blitzin 1941) with a memorable production starringPeggy Ashcroftas Viola.Gielguddirected a production at theShakespeare Memorial TheatrewithLaurence Olivieras Malvolio andVivien Leighplaying both Viola and Sebastian in 1955. The longest-runningBroadwayproduction by far wasMargaret Webster's 1940 staging starringMaurice Evansas Malvolio andHelen Hayesas Viola. It ran for 129 performances, more than twice as long as any otherBroadwayproduction.

A memorable production directed byLiviu Ciuleiat theGuthrie Theaterin Minneapolis in 1984 was set in the context of an archetypal circus world, emphasising the play's convivial,carnivalesquetone.[26]

When the play was first performed, all female parts were played by men or boys, but it has been the practice for some centuries now to cast women or girls in the female parts in all plays. The company ofShakespeare's Globe, London, has produced many notable, highly popular all-male performances, and a highlight of their 2002 season wasTwelfth Night, with the Globe's artistic directorMark Rylanceplaying Olivia. This season was preceded, in February, by a performance of the play by the same company at Middle Temple Hall, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the play's première, at the same venue.Stephen FryplayedMalvoliowhen the same production was revived in 2012–13, later transferring to sell-out runs in theWest EndandBroadway; it ran inrepertorywithRichard III.[27]

Many renowned actresses have played Viola in the latter half of the 20th century, and their performances been interpreted in the light of how far they allow the audience to experience the transgression of stereotypical gender roles.[28](p 15)This has sometimes correlated with how far productions of the play go towards reaffirming a sense of unification; for example, a 1947 production concentrated on showing a post-World War II community reuniting at the end of the play, led by a robust hero / heroine in Viola, played byBeatrix Lehmann, then 44 years old.[28](pp 18–20)The 1966Royal Shakespeare Companyproduction played on gender transgressions more obviously, withDiana Riggas Viola showing much more physical attraction towards the duke than previously seen, and the court in general being a more physically demonstrative place, particularly between males.[28](p 30)John Barton's 1969 production starredDonald Sindenas Malvolio andJudi Denchas Viola; their performances were highly acclaimed and the production as a whole was said to show a society crumbling into decay.[28](p 34)

Malvolio is a popular character choice among stage actors; he has been portrayed byIan Holmmany times,Simon Russell Beale(Donmar Warehouse, 2002),Richard Cordery(2005),Patrick Stewart, (Chichester, 2007),Derek Jacobi(Donmar Warehouse, 2009),Richard Wilson(2009),[29]andStephen Fry(The Globe, 2012).[27]

In 2017, theRoyal National Theatre's production ofTwelfth Night[30]changed some of the roles from male to female, including Feste, Fabian (who became Fabia), and, most notably, Malvolio – who became Malvolia – played byTamsin Greigto largely positive reviews.[31][32][33][34]As a result, the production played with sexuality as well as gender.

In 2017–18, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Christopher Luscombe;Adrian Edmondsonplayed Malvolio,Kara TointonOlivia, andDinita GohilViola.[35]

In 2022, Old Fruit Jar Productions staged a 1980s-inspired twist on the play atRoyal Court Theatre, Liverpool, swapping lords and ladies of stately homes for rowdyBenidormbars and booze-fuelled escapades, as an introduction to Shakespeare for audiences unfamiliar with his work.

Due to its themes such as young women seeking independence in a "man's world", "gender bending" and "same sex attraction",[36]there have been a number of re-workings for the stage, particularly in musical theatre, among themYour Own Thing(1968),Music Is(1977),All Shook Up(2005), andPlay On!(1997), the last twojukebox musicalsfeaturing the music ofElvis PresleyandDuke Ellington, respectively. Another adaptation isIllyria(2002) by composerPete Mills, which continues to perform regularly throughout the United States. In 2018, thePublic Theatreworkshopped and premiered a musical adaptation ofTwelfth Nightwith original music byShaina Taub, who also played the role ofFeste.[37]In 1999, the play was adapted asEpiphanyby theTakarazuka Revue, adding more overt commentary on the role of theatre and actors, as well as gender as applied to the stage (made more layered by the fact that all roles in this production were played by women).[38][39]There are many new modern plays but mostly still played in Early Modern English.

Theatre Grottesco, aLecocq-inspired company based out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, created a modern version of the play from the point of view of the servants working for Duke Orsino and Lady Olivia, entitledGrottesco's 12thNight(2008).[40][41]The adaptation takes a much deeper look at the issues of classism, and society without leadership.  In New York City, Turn to Flesh Productions, a theatre company that specializes in creating "new Shakespeare shows", developed two plays focused onMalvolio:A Comedy of Heirors, or The Impostersby verse playwright,Emily C. A. Snyder, which imagined a disgraced Malvolio chasing down two pairs of female twins in Syracuse and Ephesus, andMalvolio's Revengeby verse playwright,Duncan Pflaster, a queer sequel toTwelfth Night.[42][43][44][45]Both plays were originally written for submission to theAmerican Shakespeare Center's call for plays in conversation with the Bard through theShakespeare's New Contemporariesprogram.
