At the turn of the 20th century, Mary Lennox is a neglected and unloved 10-year-old girl, born inBritish Indiato wealthy British parents. She is cared for primarily by native servants, who spoil her and allow her to have free rein. After acholeraepidemic kills her parents, Mary is left alone when the few surviving servants flee.

Mary is discovered by British soldiers who place her in the care of an English clergyman, whose children taunt her by calling her "Mistress Mary, quite contrary". She is sent to England to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, husband of her father's sister Lilias. He lives on theYorkshire Moorsin a largecountry house, Misselthwaite Manor. On arrival, Mary discovers that Lilias  is dead and that Archibald is ahunchback.

At first, Mary remains angry and defiant. She dislikes her new home, the people living in it and, most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. Over time, she becomes less cantankerous. She befriends her maid, Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about Lilias, who would spend hours in a privatewalled gardengrowing roses. Lilias died after an accident in the garden ten years previously, and the devastated Archibald locked the garden and buried the key.

Mary becomes interested in finding the secret garden herself, and her manners begin to soften as a result. Soon, she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendlyrobin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve.

The robin draws Mary's attention to an area of disturbed soil. Here she finds the key to the locked garden. After her first day exploring, she asks Martha for garden tools, which Martha sends with Dickon, her 12-year-old brother, who spends most of his time out on the moors. Mary and Dickon take a liking to each other. Eager to absorb his gardening knowledge, Mary tells him about the secret garden.

One night, Mary follows mysterious cries that echo through the house. She is startled to find a boy of her own age, Colin, living in a hidden bedroom. She discovers that they are cousins, Colin being the son of Archibald Craven. Colin suffers from fevers and is confined to bed, believed unable to walk. Like Mary, he has grown very spoiled, with servants obeying his every whim in order to prevent his hysterical temper tantrums. Mary visits Colin every day that week, distracting him from his troubles and despondency with stories of the moor, Dickon, and the secret garden. She eventually confides to Colin that she has access to the secret garden, and he asks to see it. Colin is put into his wheelchair and brought outside, the first time he has been outdoors for several years.

In the garden, the children are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled to see the children, he admits that he believed Colin to be "a cripple," with a crooked back and crooked legs. Furious at Ben's comments, Colin rises shakily from his chair and finds that he can stand, although his legs are weak from long disuse. Mary and Dickon spend almost every day in the garden with Colin, and encourage him to attempt walking. Gradually, Colin finds renewed hope for his future. Together, the children and Ben conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret from the other staff, hoping to surprise his father who is travelling abroad.

As his son's health has improved, Archibald has been experiencing an improvement in his own spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Dickon and Martha's mother, advising him to return to Misselthwaite, he takes the opportunity to come home. Walking around the garden wall, he is startled to hear voices inside. He finds the door unlocked, and is astonished to see the garden in full bloom and his son restored to health, having just won a race against Mary. The children tell their story, explaining the restoration of both the garden and Colin. Archibald and his son walk back to the manor together, to the amazement of the servants.

In his analysis of the narrative structures of "the traditional novel for girls", Perry Nodelman highlights Mary Lennox as a departure from the narrative pattern of the "spontaneous and ebullient" orphan girl who changes her new home and family for the better, since those qualities appear later on in the narrative. The revival of the family and the home in these novels, according to Nodelman, "is carried to the extreme inThe Secret Garden," in which the garden's restoration and the arrival of spring parallel the emergence of human characters from the home, "almost as if they had been hibernating".[5]Joe Sutliff Sanders examines Mary andThe Secret Gardenwithin the context of the Victorian and Edwardian cultural debate over affective discipline, which was echoed in contemporary books about orphan girls. He suggests thatThe Secret Gardenwas interested in showing the benefits of affective discipline for men and boys, namely Colin who learns from Mary, understood as "the novel's representative of girlhood" and how to wield his "masculine privilege".[6]

The titular garden has been the subject of much scholarly discussion. Phyllis Bixler Koppes writes thatThe Secret Gardenmakes use of thefairy tale, theexemplum, and thepastoralliterary genres, which lends the novel a deeper "thematic development and symbolic resonance" than Burnett's earlier children's novels which only used elements from the first two traditions.[7]She describes the garden as "the centralgeorgictrope, the unifying symbol of rebirth in Burnett's novel".[8]Madelon S. Gohlke understands the titular garden as "both the scene of a tragedy, resulting in the near destruction of a family", as well as the site of its regeneration and restoration.[9]

Alexandra Valint suggests that most of the novel's depictions of disability coincide with the stereotypical view of people with disabilities as unhappy, helpless, and less independent than people without disabilities. Colin's use of a wheelchair would have been understood by Edwardian readers as a marker of both disability and social status.[10]

Elizabeth Lennox Keyser writes thatThe Secret Gardenis ambivalent about sex roles: while Mary restores the garden and saves the family, her role in the story is overshadowed at the conclusion of the novel by the return of Colin and his father, which may be seen as a defense of patriarchal authority.[11]Danielle E. Price notes that the novel deals with "the thorny issues of sex, class, and imperialism".[12]She writes how Mary's development in the novel parallels "the steps of nineteenth-century garden theorists in their plans for the perfect garden", with Mary ultimately turning into "a girl who, like the ideal garden, can provide both beauty and comfort, and who can cultivate her male cousin, the young patriarch-in-training".[12]

At the time Burnett began working onThe Secret Garden, she had already established a literary reputation as a writer of children's fiction andsocial realistadult fiction.[13]She had started writing children's fiction in the 1880s, with her most notable book at the time being hersentimentalnovelLittle Lord Fauntleroy(1886).[14]Little Lord Fauntleroywas a "literary sensation" in both the United States and Europe, and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.[13]Prior toThe Secret Garden, she had also written another notable work of children's fiction,A Little Princess(1905), which had begun as a story published in the American children's magazineSt. Nicholas Magazinein 1887 and was later adapted as a play in 1902.[15]

Little is known about the literary development and conception ofThe Secret Garden.[16]Biographers and other scholars have been able to glean the details of Burnett's process and thoughts on her other books through her letters to family members; during the time she was working onThe Secret Garden, however, she was living near to them and thus did not need to send them letters.[16]Burnett started the novel in spring 1909, as she was making plans for the garden at her home inPlandomeonLong Island.[17]In an October 1910 letter toWilliam Heinemann, her publisher in England, she described the story, whose working title wasMistress Mary, as "an innocent thriller of a story" that she considered "one of [her] best finds".[18]Biographer Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina offers several explanations as to why there is so little surviving information on the book's development. Firstly, Burnett's health faltered after moving to her home in Plandome, and her social excursions became limited as a result. Secondly, her existing notes aboutThe Secret Garden, along with a portrait of her and some photographs, were donated by her son Vivian after her death to a lower Manhattan public school serving the deaf in remembrance of her visit there years previously, but all the items soon vanished from the archive of the school. Lastly, a few weeks before the novel's publication, her brother-in-law died in a collision with a trolley, an event that likely darkened the novel's publication.[19]

Burnett's storyMy Robin, however, offers a glimpse of the creation ofThe Secret Garden.[20]In it, she addresses a reader's question on the literary origins of the robin that appears inThe Secret Garden, whom the reader felt "could not have been a mere creature of fantasy".[21]Burnett reminisces on her friendship with the real-life English robin, whom she described as "aperson—not a mere bird" and who often kept her company in the rose garden where she would often write, when she lived at Maytham Hall.[21]Recounting the first time she tried to communicate with the bird via "low, soft, little sounds", she writes that she "knew—years later—that this is what Mistress Mary thought when she bent down in the Long Walk and 'tried to make robin sounds'".[22]

Maytham Hallin Kent, England, where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.[23]Biographer Ann Thwaite writes that while the rose garden at Mayham Hall may have been "crucial" to the novel's development, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different.[23]Thwaite suggests that, for the setting ofThe Secret Garden, Burnett may have been inspired by the moors ofEmily Brontë's 1847 novelWuthering Heights, given that Burnett only went once toYorkshire, toFryston Hall.[24]She writes that Burnett may have also taken inspiration fromCharlotte Brontë's 1847 novelJane Eyre, noting parallels between the two narratives: both of them, for example, feature orphans sent to "mysterious mansions", whose master is largely absent.[25]Burnett herself was aware of the similarities, remarking in a letter thatElla Hepworth Dixonhad described it as a children's version ofJane Eyre.[18]

Scholar Gretchen V. Rector has examined the author's manuscript ofThe Secret Garden, which she describes as "the only record of the novel's development".[26]Eighty of the first hundred pages of the manuscript are written in black ink, while the rest and subsequent revisions were made in pencil; the spelling and punctuation tend to follow theAmerican standard. Chapter headings were included prior to the novel's serialization and are not present in the manuscript, with chapters in it delineated by numbers only.[27]The pagination of the manuscript was likely done by a second person: it goes from 1 to 234, only to restart at the nineteenth chapter.[27]From the title page, Rector surmises that the novel's first title wasMary, Mary quite Contrary, later changed to its working title ofMistress Mary.[26]Mary herself is originally nine in the manuscript, only to be aged up a year in a revision, perhaps to highlight the "convergent paths" of Mary, Colin, and the garden itself; however, this revision was not reflected in either the British or the American first editions of the novel, or in later editions.[28]Susan Sowerby is initially introduced to the readers as a deceased character, with her daughter Martha perhaps intended to fill her role in the story; Burnett, however, changed her mind about Susan Sowerby, writing her as a living character a few pages later and crossing out the announcement of her death.[29]Additionally, Dickon in the manuscript was physically disabled and used crutches to move around, perhaps drawing on Burnett's recollections of her first husband, Dr. Swan Burnett, and his physical disability. Burnett later removed references to Dickon's disability.[30]

The Secret Gardenmay be one of the first instances of a story for children first appearing in a magazine with an adult readership,[31]an occasion of which Burnett herself was aware at the time.[18]The Secret Gardenwas first published in ten issues (November 1910 – August 1911) ofThe American Magazine, with illustrations by J. Scott Williams.[32]It was first published in book form in August 1911 by theFrederick A. StokesCompany in New York;[33]it was also published that year byWilliam Heinemannin London, illustrated byCharles Robinson. Itscopyrightexpired in the US in 1986,[34]and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in thepublic domain. As a result, several abridged and unabridged editions were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as a full-colour illustrated edition fromDavid R. Godine, Publisherin 1989.

Inga Moore's abridged edition of 2008, illustrated by her, is arranged so that a line of the text also serves as a caption to a picture.

Upon its publication in novel format,The Secret Gardengarnered largely warm reviews from literary critics,[35][36]and sold well, with a second printing announced within a month after the novel's release.[37]In general, it was seen as an enjoyable novel, and was reviewed within the context of Burnett's previous works, includingLittle Lord Fauntleroy.[38]It sold well during the 1911 Christmas season, becoming a bestseller in the fiction category, and placing on critical "best of" lists, including that of theLiterary DigestandThe New York Times.[39]Its literary debut in a magazine for adults led the public to understand it as adult fiction; the book was marketed accordingly, "with some overlap in the juvenile market", which affected its reception by the public.[40]Of this time, scholar Anne Lundin writes that "The Secret Gardenstruggled to assert its own identity as a different kind of story that spoke to both the romanticism and modernism of a new century".[40]Burnett regardedThe Secret Gardenas her favorite novel, although she considered one of her novels for adults,In Connection with the DeWilloughby Claim, to be herGreat American Novel.[41]

Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Lundin notes that the author's obituary notices all remarked onLittle Lord Fauntleroyand passed overThe Secret Gardenin silence.[42]Burnett's literary reputation waned over the following decades, possibly as a result of biases towards books that garner a female audience.[43]Despite being largely overlooked by literary critics and librarians,[44]The Secret Gardenenjoyed a considerable following among its readers.[35]It continued to rank well on readers' polls for favorite stories. In 1927, it placed in the top fifteen favorite books of femaleYouth Companionreaders, and in the 1960s, the readers ofThe New York TimesrankedThe Secret Gardenas one of the best children's books. Surveys of adult readers in the 1970s and 1980s show that the novel was a frequent childhood favorite, especially for women.[45]

Burnett's literary reputation underwent a critical resurgence in the 1950s.Marghanita Laski'sMrs Ewing, Mrs Molesworth and Mrs Hodgson Burnett(1951) describedThe Secret Garden,A Little Princess, andLittle Lord Fauntleroyas the best of Burnett's children's books; Laski consideredThe Secret Gardento be the best of the three, with a capacity to reach thoughtful and self-reflective children.[43]Other British literary critics and historians began to take note of the novel, includingRoger Lancelyn GreenandJohn Rowe Townsend.[46]Thwaite's biography about Burnett,Waiting for the Party(1974), highlightedThe Secret Gardenfor its depiction of unpleasant children that she felt was much closer to contemporary ideas about how children behave.[47]At the time that Thwaite's biography was published, children's literature was becoming a field of greater scholarly interest, and as a result,The Secret Gardenbegan to garner more scholarly analysis.[48]The Secret Gardenbecame accepted as part of the scholarlycanonof children's literature in the 1980s.[48]

In the twentieth-first century,The Secret Gardencontinues to be well regarded among readers. In 2003 it ranked No. 51 inThe Big Read, a survey of the British public by theBBCto identify the "Nation's Best-loved Novel" (not just children's novel).[49]Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted it as one of "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".[50][51]In 2012, it was ranked No. 15 among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal, a monthly with a primarily US audience.[52]A Little Princesswas ranked number 56 andLittle Lord Fauntleroydid not make the Top 100.[52]Jeffrey MassonconsidersThe Secret Garden"one of the greatest books ever written for children".[53]In an oblique compliment,Barbara Sleighhas her title character readingThe Secret Gardenon the train at the beginning of her children's novelJessamyandRoald Dahl, in his children's bookMatilda, has his title character say that she likedThe Secret Gardenbest of all the children's books in the library.[54]
