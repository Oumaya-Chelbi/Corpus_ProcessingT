On the surface, the novel is a love story between theprotagonistJake Barnes—a man whose war wound has made him unable to havesex—and the promiscuous divorcée Lady Brett Ashley. Jake is anexpatriateAmerican journalist living inParis, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman withbobbedhair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Jake's Princeton friend Robert Cohn (whom the characters often refer to by his last name) causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-oldmatadorRomero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards inPamplona.

Book One is set in thecafé societyof young American expatriates in Paris. In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with Cohn, picks up aprostitutenamed Georgette, and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they both know that they have no chance at a stable relationship.

In Book Two, Jake is joined by Bill Gorton, recently arrived fromNew York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives fromScotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Cohn atBayonnefor a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona to wait for the overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn had an affair with Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams nearBurguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.

All begin to drink heavily. Cohn is resented by the others, who taunt him withantisemiticremarks. During thefiesta, the characters drink, eat, watch therunning of the bulls, attend bullfights, and bicker. Jake introduces Brett to the 19-year-old matador Romero at the Hotel Montoya; she is smitten with him and seduces him. The jealous tension among the men builds—Jake, Mike, Cohn, and Romero each want Brett. Cohn, who had been a championboxerin college, has a fistfight with Jake and Mike, and another with Romero, whom he beats up. Despite his injuries, Romero continues to perform brilliantly in the bullring.

Book Three shows the characters in the aftermath of the fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes toSan Sebastiánon the northern coast ofSpain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives atelegramfrom Brett asking for help; she had gone toMadridwith Romero. He finds her in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking and thinking of what might have been.

The first book ofThe Sun Also Risesis set in mid-1920s Paris.  Americans were drawn to Paris in theRoaring Twentiesby the favorableexchange rate, with as many as 200,000 English-speaking expatriates living there.  TheParis Tribunereported in 1925 that Paris had anAmerican Hospital, an American Library, and an American Chamber of Commerce.[30]Many American writers were disenchanted with the US, where they found less artistic freedom than in Europe. (For example, Hemingway was in Paris during the period whenUlysses, written by his friendJames Joyce, was banned  and burned in New York.)[31]

The themes ofThe Sun Also Risesappear in its twoepigraphs. The first is anallusionto the "Lost Generation", a term coined byGertrude Steinreferring to the post-war generation;[note 2][32]the other epigraph is a long quotation fromEcclesiastes: "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."[33]Hemingway told his editor Max Perkins that the book was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever." He thought the characters inThe Sun Also Risesmay have been "battered" but were not lost.[5]

Hemingway scholar Wagner-Martin writes that Hemingway wanted the book to be about morality, which he emphasized by changing the working title fromFiestatoThe Sun Also Rises.Wagner-Martin argues that the book can be read either as a novel about bored expatriates or as a morality tale about a protagonist who searches for integrity in an immoral world.[34]Months before Hemingway left for Pamplona, the press was depicting the ParisianLatin Quarter, where he lived, as decadent and depraved.  He began writing the story of a matador corrupted by the influence of the Latin Quarter crowd; he expanded it into a novel about Jake Barnes at risk of being corrupted by wealthy and inauthentic expatriates.[35]

The characters form a group, sharing similar norms, and each greatly affected by the war.[34]Hemingway captures the angst of the age and transcends the love story of Brett and Jake, although they are representative of the period: Brett is starved for reassurance and love and Jake is sexually maimed.  His wound symbolizes the disability of the age, the disillusion, and the frustrations felt by an entire generation.[34]

Hemingway thought he lost touch with American values while living in Paris, but his biographerMichael S. Reynoldsclaims the opposite, seeing evidence of the author'smidwestern Americanvalues in the novel.  Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of "the rotten crowd" living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval of the people who did not pay up.[36]Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, and those who do not work for a living spend their lives posing.[37]

The twice-divorced Brett Ashley represented the liberatedNew Woman(in the 1920s, divorces were common and easy to be had in Paris).[38]James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created one of the more fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: the men drink too much and fight over her. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes aCircein the festival.[39]Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway "treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy."[40]She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.[41]

Nagel considers the novel a tragedy. Jake and Brett have a relationship that becomes destructive because their love cannot be consummated.  Conflict over Brett destroys Jake's friendship with Robert Cohn, and her behavior in Pamplona affects Jake's hard-won reputation among the Spaniards.[39]Meyers sees Brett as a woman who wants sex without love while Jake can only give her love without sex.  Although Brett sleeps with many men, it is Jake she loves.[42]Dana Fore writes that Brett is willing to be with Jake in spite of his disability, in a "non-traditional erotic relationship."[43]Other critics such asLeslie FiedlerandNina Baymsee her as a supreme bitch; Fiedler sees Brett as one of the "outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'"[44][45]Jake becomes bitter about their relationship, as when he says, "Send a girl off with a man .... Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love."[46]

Critics interpret the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways.  Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality.[47]Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship in such a manner that Jake knew "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill."[48]Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid toSan Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike.[49]In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, "you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her."[50]By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her.[50]Reynolds believes that Jake represents the "everyman," and that in the course of the narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as amorality playwith Jake as the person who loses the most.[51]

InThe Sun Also Rises, Hemingway contrasts Paris with Pamplona, and the frenzy of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside.  Spain was among Hemingway's favorite European countries; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country "that hasn't been shot to pieces."[52]He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing,

He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—calledafición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisianbohemians.[53]To be accepted as anaficionadowas rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the "fellowship ofafición."[54]

Allen Josephs thinks the novel is centered on thecorrida(the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between the world of the inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death.[55]Thecorridais presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment ofexistentialismornada(nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.[56]

Hemingway presents matadors as heroic characters dancing in a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, in contrast to the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced.[34]Critic Keneth Kinnamon argues that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character.[54]Hemingway named Romero afterPedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still.  Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the "one idealized figure in the novel."[57]Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one ofrecibiendo(receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.[58]

Before the group arrives in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take a fishing trip to the Irati River. AsHarold Bloompoints out, the scene serves as an interlude between the Paris and Pamplona sections, "an oasis that exists outside linear time."  On another level it reflects "the mainstream of American fiction beginning with the Pilgrims seeking refuge from English oppression"—the prominent theme in American literature of escaping into the wilderness, as seen inCooper,Hawthorne,Melville,Twain, andThoreau.[59]Fiedler calls the theme "The Sacred Land"; he thinks the American West is evoked inThe Sun Also Risesby thePyreneesand given a symbolic nod with the name of the "Hotel Montana."[44]In Hemingway's writing, nature is a place of refuge and rebirth, according to Stoltzfus, where the hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at the moment the prey is killed.[56]Nature is the place where men act without women: men fish, men hunt, men find redemption.[44]In nature Jake and Bill do not need to discuss the war because their war experience, paradoxically, is ever-present. The nature scenes serve as counterpoint to the fiesta scenes.[34]

All of the characters drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay "Alcoholism in Hemingway'sThe Sun Also Rises", Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake's self-pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic, as is Brett's out-of-control behavior.[60]William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch.[61]Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context ofProhibition in the United States.  The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition.  Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, he drinks constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.[62]

Critics have seen Jake as an ambiguous representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, in the bar scene in Paris, Jake is angry at somehomosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity.[63]His sense of masculine identity is lost—he is less than a man.[64]Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women.[65]Hemingway's writing has been calledhomophobicbecause of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, "I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot."[66]

In contrast to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery and competence. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might be trying to undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.[67]

Critics have examined issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent in much of Hemingway's work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women.[68]In his fiction, a woman's hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, isandrogynousand compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity lies in the fact that she is described as a "damned fine-looking woman." While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects Brett because, among other things, she will not grow her hair.

Hemingway has been called antisemitic, most notably because of the characterization of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'.[70]Shunned by the other members of the group, Cohn is characterized as "different", unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta.[70]Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith.[34]Barry Gross, comparing Jewish characters in literature of the period, commented that "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew."[71][72]Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a "shlemiel" (or fool), but she points out that Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.[73]

Cohn is based onHarold Loeb, a fellow writer who rivaled Hemingway for the affections of Duff, Lady Twysden (the real-life inspiration for Brett). Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that in 1925, Loeb should have declined Hemingway's invitation to join them in Pamplona. Before the trip, he was Duff's lover and Hemingway's friend; during the fiasco of the fiesta, he lost Duff and Hemingway's friendship. Hemingway used Loeb as the basis of a character remembered chiefly as a "rich Jew."[74]

The Sun Also Risesreflects the pervasive disillusionment experienced by the "Lost Generation" in the aftermath ofWorld War I. The novel portrays a world where traditional sources of meaning—religion, work, and love—fail to provide lasting fulfillment, leaving characters trapped in cycles of dissatisfaction. Jake Barnes and his expatriate companions struggle to find purpose in a modern world marked by loss and despair. Hemingway suggests that the only viable response to this existential crisis is a stoic acceptance of life’s inherent tragedy. His sparse prose and emphasis on omission underscore the underlying themes of repressed desires and emotional detachment.[75]

The novel is well known for its style, which is variously described as modern,hard-boiled, or understated.[76]As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned toEzra Pound—who had a reputation as "an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent"—to mark and blue-ink his short stories.[77]From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in themoderniststyle: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book's conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake.[76][note 3]The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to "distrust adjectives," he created a style "in accordance with the esthetics and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by shutting the door on sentiment, on the subjective."[78]

F. Scott Fitzgeraldtold Hemingway to "let the book's action play itself out among its characters." Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin writes that, in taking Fitzgerald's advice, Hemingway produced a novel without a central narrator: "Hemingway's book was a step ahead; it was the modernist novel."[79]When Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to trim at least 2500 words from the opening sequence, which was 30 pages long, Hemingway wired the publishers telling them to cut the opening 30 pages altogether. The result was a novel without a focused starting point, which was seen as a modern perspective and critically well received.[80]
