A few hundred years after the One State's conquest of the entire world, the spaceshipINTEGRALis being built in order to invade and conquer extraterrestrial planets. The project's chief engineer, D-503, begins ajournalthat he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship. The book is this journal—it titles chapters as '[n]th Entry' and begins each entry with three lines of notes summarising the events therein.

Like all other citizens of the One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by thesecret police, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by that status. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.

While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are illegal according to the laws of the One State.

Repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in the One State, except for windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians but finds that he cannot.

D-503 begins to have dreams, which disturb him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom ofmental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organization plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of the One State with the outside world.

Despite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. During the pregnancy, O-90 realizes that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby. At D-503's request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall.

In his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the "Great Operation", which has recently been mandated for all citizens of the One State to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical "reliability", they would now function as "tractors in human form".[8][9]This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor, the dictator of the One State, about the inner workings of the Mephi. I-330 is then brought to an interrogation chamber, and subjected to torture by suffocation; D-503 expresses surprise that even torture could not induce I-330 to denounce her comrades. Despite her refusal, I-330 and those arrested with her have been sentenced to death, "under the Benefactor's Machine".

The Mephi uprising gathers strength; parts of the Green Wall have been destroyed, birds are repopulating the city and people start committing acts of social rebellion. Although D-503 expresses hope that the Benefactor shall restore "reason", the novel ends with the One State's survival in doubt. I-330's mantra is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be nofinalrevolution.

The dystopian society depicted inWeis presided over by the Benefactor and is surrounded by a giant Green Wall to separate the citizens from primitive untamed nature.[10]All citizens are known as "numbers".[11]Every hour in one's life is directed by the "Table of Hours". The action ofWeis set at some time after the Two Hundred Years' War, which has wiped out all but "0.2 [20%] of the earth's population".[12]The war was over a rare substance only mentioned in the book through a metaphor; the substance was called "bread" as the "Christians gladiated over it"—as in Christians killed for sport in Roman gladiator games as a form of entertainment, "bread and circuses", suggesting a war that was meant to distract the population from a power grab by the government. The war only ended after the use ofweapons of mass destruction, so that the One State is surrounded with a post-apocalyptic landscape.

Many of the names and numbers inWeare allusions to the experiences of Zamyatin or to culture and literature. "Auditorium 112" refers to cell number 112, where Zamyatin was twice imprisoned and the name of S-4711 is a reference to theEau de Colognenumber4711.[13][14]Zamyatin, who worked as anaval architect, refers to the specifications of theicebreakerSt. Alexander Nevsky.[15]

Many comparisons to The Bible exist inWe.  There are similarities betweenGenesisChapters 1–4 andWe, where the One State is consideredParadise, D-503 isAdamand I-330 isEve. The snake in this piece is S-4711, who is described as having a bent and twisted form, with a "double-curved body"; he is a double agent. References to Mephistopheles (in the Mephi) are seen as allusions toSatanand his rebellion againstHeavenin the Bible (Ezekiel 28:11–19; Isaiah 14:12–15).[18][19][20]The novel can be considered a criticism of organised religion given this interpretation.[21]Zamyatin, influenced byFyodor Dostoyevsky'sNotes from UndergroundandThe Brothers Karamazov, made the novel a criticism of the excesses of a militantly atheistic society.[21][22]The novel displayed an indebtedness toH. G. Wells's dystopiaWhen the Sleeper Wakes(1899).[23]

The novel uses mathematical concepts symbolically. The spaceship that D-503 is supervising the construction of is called theIntegral, which he hopes will "integrate the grandiose cosmic equation". D-503 also mentions that he is profoundly disturbed by the concept ofthe square root of −1—which is the basis for imaginary numbers, imagination having been deprecated by the One State. Zamyatin's point, probably in light of the increasingly dogmatic Soviet government of the time, would seem to be that it is impossible to remove all the rebels against a system. Zamyatin even says this through I-330, "There is no final revolution. Revolutions are infinite".[24]

Along withJack London'sThe Iron Heel,Weis generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristicdystopiagenre. It takes the modern industrial society to an extreme conclusion, depicting a state that believes thatfree willis the cause of unhappiness, and that citizens' lives should be controlled with mathematical precision based on the system of industrial efficiency created byFrederick Winslow Taylor. The Soviet attempt at implementing Taylorism, led byAleksei Gastev, may have immediately influenced Zamyatin's portrayal of the One State.[25]In Russia, a dystopian totalitarian society before Zamyatin was described byMikhail Saltykovin his satirical novelThe History of a Town, and Saltykov's idea of "Utopia of the straight line" continues inWe: "To unbend the wild curve, to straighten it out to a tangent — to a straight line!"[26]

Christopher Collins inEvgenij Zamjatin: An Interpretive Studyfinds the many intriguing literary aspects ofWemore interesting and relevant today than the political aspects:

The little-known Russian dystopian novelLove in the Fog of the Future, published in 1924 by Andrei Marsov, has also been compared toWe.[27]

George Orwellclaimed thatAldous Huxley'sBrave New World(1932) must be partly derived fromWe.[28]However, in a letter to Christopher Collins in 1962, Huxley says that he wroteBrave New Worldas a reaction to H. G. Wells's utopias long before he had heard ofWe.[29]

Kurt Vonnegutsaid that in writingPlayer Piano(1952), he "cheerfully ripped off the plot ofBrave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin'sWe".[30]Ayn Rand'sAnthem(1938) has many significant similarities toWe(detailedhere), although it is stylistically and thematically different.[31]Vladimir Nabokov's novelInvitation to a Beheadingmay suggest a dystopian society with some similarities to Zamyatin's; Nabokov readWewhile writingInvitation to a Beheading.[32]

Orwell beganNineteen Eighty-Four(1949) some eight months after he readWein a French translation and wrote a review of it.[33]Orwell is reported as "saying that he was taking it as the model for his next novel".[34]Brown writes that for Orwell and certain others,We"appears to have beenthecrucial literary experience".[35]Shane states that "Zamyatin's influence on Orwell is beyond dispute".[36]Robert Russell, in an overview of the criticism ofWe, concludes that "1984shares so many features withWethat there can be no doubt about its general debt to it"; but that there is a minority of critics who view the similarities betweenWeandNineteen Eighty-Fouras "entirely superficial". Further, Russell finds that "Orwell's novel is both bleaker and more topical than Zamyatin's, lacking entirely that ironic humour that pervades the Russian work".[29]

InThe Right Stuff(1979),Tom WolfedescribesWeas a "marvelously morose novel of the future" featuring an "omnipotent spaceship" called theIntegralwhose "designer is known only as 'D-503, Builder of the Integral'". Wolfe goes on to use theIntegralas a metaphor for the Sovietlaunch vehicle, the Soviet space programme, or the Soviet Union.[37]

Jerome K. Jeromehas been cited as an influence on Zamyatin's novel.[38]Jerome's short storyThe New Utopia(1891)[39]describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarishegalitarianism, where men and women are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin's "unifs") and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has a name: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as inWe. Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome has anyone with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation—something of central importance inWe. There is a shared depiction by both Jerome and Zamyatin that individual and, by extension, familial love is a disruptive and humanizing force.  Jerome's works were translated in Russia three times before 1917.[citation needed]

In 1998, the first English translation ofCursed Days, a diary kept in secret in 1918-20 byanti-communistRussian authorIvan Buninduring theRussian Civil WarinMoscowandOdessawas published inChicago. In a foreword, the diary's English translator, Thomas Gaiton Marullo, describedCursed Daysas a rare example ofdystopiannonfictionand pointed out multiple parallels between the secret diary kept by Bunin and the diary kept by D-503.[40]

Zamyatin's literary position deteriorated throughout the 1920s, and he was eventually allowed to emigrate to Paris in 1931, probably after the intercession ofMaxim Gorky.

The novel was first published in English in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York in a translation byGregory Zilboorg,[41]but its first publication in theSoviet Unionhad to wait until 1988,[42]whenglasnostresulted in it appearing alongsideGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four. A year later,WeandBrave New Worldwere published together in a combined edition.[43]

In 1994, the novel received aPrometheus Awardin the "Hall of Fame" category.[44]

The German TV networkZDFadapted the novel for a TV movie in 1982, under the German titleWir(English: We).[45]

Weis heavily referenced in the 2023 sci-fi feature film1984.

The novel has also been adapted, by Alain Bourret, a French director, into a short film calledThe Glass Fortress(2016).[46]The Glass Fortressis an experimental film that employs a technique known asstill image film, and is shot inblack-and-white, which help support the grim atmosphere of the story'sdystopian society.[47]The film is technically similar toLa Jetée(1962), directed byChris Marker, and refers somewhat toTHX 1138(1971), byGeorge Lucas, in the "religious appearance of the Well Doer".[48]According to film criticIsabelle Arnaud,The Glass Fortresshas a special atmosphere underlining a story of thwarted love that will be long remembered.[49]

A Russian film adaptation, directed by Hamlet Dulyan and starringEgor Koreshkov, initially planned for release in 2021,[50]was released in 2024.

A two-part adaptation by Sean O'Brien and directed by Jim Poyser was broadcast on 18 and 25 April 2004 onBBC Radio 4'sClassic Serial.[51]The cast includedAnton Lesseras D-503,Joanna Ridingas I-330, Julia Routhwaite as O-90,Brigit Forsythas U, Patrick Bridgeman as S andDon Warringtonas R-13.

The Montreal company Théâtre Deuxième Réalité produced an adaptation of the novel in 1996, adapted and directed byAlexandre Marine, under the titleNous Autres.[52]

Released in 2015,The Glass Fortress[53]is a musical and narrative adaptation of the novel by Rémi Orts Project and Alan B.

In 2022, the Canadianindie rockbandArcade FirereleasedWe, an album whose title was inspired by the novel.[54]

In 2022, independent creator Doug Strain producedBeyond the Green Wall, a Dungeons and Dragons adventure based on the novel.
