The entire book is presented as adream sequencenarrated by anomniscient narrator. The allegory's protagonist, Christian, is aneverymancharacter, and the plot centres on his journey from his hometown, the "City of Destruction" ("this world"), to the "Celestial City" ("that which is to come":Heaven) atop MountZion. Christian is weighed down by a great burden—the knowledge of his sin—which he believed came from his reading "the book in his hand" (theBible). This burden, which would cause him to sink into Hell, is so unbearable that Christian must seek deliverance. He meets Evangelist as he is walking out in the fields, who directs him to the "Wicket Gate" for deliverance. Since Christian cannot see the "Wicket Gate" in the distance, Evangelist directs him to go to a "shining light", which Christian thinks he sees.[16]Christian leaves his home, his wife, and children to save himself: he cannot persuade them to accompany him. Obstinate and Pliable go after Christian to bring him back, but Christian refuses. Obstinate returns disgusted, but Pliable is persuaded to go with Christian, hoping to take advantage of the Paradise that Christian claims lies at the end of his journey. Pliable's journey with Christian is cut short when the two of them fall into theSlough of Despond, a boggy mire-like swamp where pilgrims' doubts, fears, temptations, lusts, shames, guilts, and sins of their present condition of being a sinner are used to sink them into the mud of the swamp. It is there in that bog where Pliable abandons Christian after getting himself out. After struggling to the other side of the slough, Christian is pulled out by Help, who has heard his cries and tells him the swamp is made out of the decadence, scum, and filth of sin, but the ground is good at the narrow Wicket Gate.

On his way to the Wicket Gate, Christian is diverted by thesecular ethicsof Mr. Worldly Wiseman into seeking deliverance from his burden through the Law, supposedly with the help of a Mr. Legality and his son Civility in the village of Morality, rather than through Christ, allegorically by way of the Wicket Gate. Evangelist meets the wayward Christian as he stops beforeMount Sinaion the way to Mr. Legality's home. It hangs over the road and threatens to crush any who would pass it; also the mountain flashes with fire. Evangelist exposes Worldly Wiseman, Legality, and Civility for the frauds they are: they would have the pilgrim leave the true path by trusting in his own good deeds to remove his burden. Evangelist directs Christian to return to the way to the Wicket Gate, and Christian complies.

At the Wicket Gate begins the "straight and narrow" King's Highway, and Christian is directed onto it by the gatekeeper Goodwill who saves him from Beelzebub's archers at Beelzebub's castle near the Wicket Gate and shows him the heavenly way he must go. In the Second Part, Goodwill is shown to beJesusHimself.[17]To Christian's query about relief from his burden, Goodwill directs him forward to "the place of deliverance".[14][18]

Christian makes his way from there to the House of the Interpreter, where he is shown pictures andtableauxthat portray or dramatize aspects of the Christian faith and life. Roger Sharrock denotes them "emblems".[14][19]

From the House of the Interpreter, Christian finally reaches the "place of deliverance" (allegorically, the cross ofCalvaryand the opensepulchre of Christ), where the "straps" that bound Christian's burden to him break, and it rolls away into the open sepulchre. This event happens relatively early in the narrative: the immediate need of Christian at the beginning of the story is quickly remedied. After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three angels, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City. Encouraged by all this, Christian happily continues his journey until he comes upon three men named Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. Christian tries to help them, but they disregard his advice. Before coming to the Hill of Difficulty, Christian meets two well-dressed men named Formality and Hypocrisy who prove to be false Christians that perish in the two dangerous bypasses near the hill, named Danger and Destruction. Christian falls asleep at the arbour above the hill and loses his scroll, forcing him to go back and get it. Near the top of the Hill of Difficulty, he meets two weak pilgrims named Mistrust and Timorous who tell him of the great lions of the Palace Beautiful. Christian fearfully avoids the lions through Watchful the porter who tells them that they are chained and put there to test the faith of pilgrims.

Atop the Hill of Difficulty, Christian makes his first stop for the night at the House of the Palace Beautiful, which is a place built by God for the refreshment of pilgrims and godly travellers. Christian spends three days here, and leaves clothed with the Armour of God (Eph. 6:11–18),[20]which stands him in good stead in his battle against the demonic dragon-likeApollyon(the lord and god of the City of Destruction) in the Valley of Humiliation. This battle lasts "over half a day" until Christian manages to wound and stab Apollyon with his two-edged sword (a reference to the Bible, Heb. 4:12).[21]"And with that Apollyon spread his dragon wings and sped away."

As night falls, Christian enters the fearful Valley of the Shadow of Death. When he is in the middle of the Valley amidst the gloom, terror, and demons, he hears the words of theTwenty-third Psalm, spoken possibly by his friend Faithful:

As he leaves this valley the sun rises on a new day.

Just outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful, also a former resident of the City of Destruction, who accompanies him to Vanity Fair, a place built by Beelzebub where every thing to a human's taste, delight, and lust is sold daily, where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the Fair. Faithful is put on trial and executed by burning at the stake as a martyr. A celestial chariot then takes Faithful to the Celestial City, martyrdom being a shortcut there. Hopeful, a resident of Vanity Fair, takes Faithful's place to be Christian's companion for the rest of the way.

Christian and Hopeful then come to a hill called Lucre where there is a silver mine. A man called Demas urges them to join in the mining going on, but Christian sees through Demas's trickery and they avoid the mine. Afterward, a false pilgrim named By-Ends and his friends, who followed Christian and Hopeful only to take advantage of them, perish at the Hill Lucre, never to be seen or heard from again. On a rough, stony stretch of road, Christian and Hopeful leave the highway to travel on the easier By-Path Meadow, where a rainstorm forces them to spend the night. In the morning they are captured by Giant Despair, who is known for his savage cruelty, and his wife Diffidence; the pilgrims are taken to the Giant's Doubting Castle, where they are imprisoned, beaten and starved. The Giant and the Giantess want them to commitsuicide, but they endure the ordeal until Christian realizes that a key he has, called Promise, will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle. Using the key and the Giant's vulnerability to sunlight, they escape.

The Delectable Mountains form the next stage of Christian and Hopeful's journey, where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as "Immanuel's Land". The pilgrims are shown sights that strengthen their faith and warn them against sinning, like the Hill Error or the Mountain Caution. On Mount Clear, they are able to see the Celestial City through the shepherd's "perspective glass", which serves as a telescope. (This device is given to Mercy in the Second Part at her request.) The shepherds tell the pilgrims to beware of the Flatterer and to avoid the Enchanted Ground. Soon they come to a crossroad and a man dressed in white comes to help them. Thinking he is a "shining one" (angel), the pilgrims follow the man, but soon get stuck in a net and realize their so-called angelic guide was the Flatterer. A true shining one comes and frees them from the net. The Angel punishes them for following the Flatterer and then puts them back on the right path. The pilgrims meet an Atheist, who tells them Heaven and God do not exist, but Christian and Hopeful remember the shepherds and pay no attention to the man. Christian and Hopeful come to a place where a man named Wanton Professor is chained by the ropes of seven demons who take him to a shortcut to the Lake of Fire (Hell). This reminds them of a man named Little Faith, who had been mugged by thieves that stole his spending money and resulted in him having a hard life, although the thieves did not take Little Faith's scroll or his jewels, which he kept safe through his journey.

On the way, Christian and Hopeful meet a lad named Ignorance, who believes that he will be allowed into the Celestial City through his own good deeds rather than as a gift of God's grace. Christian and Hopeful meet up with him twice and try to persuade him to journey to the Celestial City in the right way. Ignorance persists in his own way that he thinks will lead him into Heaven. After getting over the River of Death on the ferry boat of Vain Hope without overcoming the hazards of wading across it, Ignorance appears before the gates of Celestial City without a passport, which he would have acquired had he gone into the King's Highway through the Wicket Gate. The Lord of the Celestial City orders the shining ones (angels) to take Ignorance to one of the byways of Hell and throw him in.

Christian and Hopeful, with deep discourse about the truth of their glorious salvation, manage to make it through the dangerous Enchanted Ground (a place where the air makes them sleepy and if they fall asleep, they never wake up) into the Land of Beulah, where they ready themselves to cross the dreaded River of Death on foot to Mount Zion and the Celestial City. Christian has a rough time of it because of his past sins wearing him down, but Hopeful helps him over, and they are welcomed into the Celestial City.

The Second Part ofThe Pilgrim's Progresspresents the pilgrimage of Christian's wife, Christiana, and their sons, and the maiden, Mercy. They visit the same stopping places that Christian visited, with the addition of Gaius' Inn between the Valley of the Shadow of Death and Vanity Fair, but they take a longer time in order to accommodate marriage andchildbirthfor the four sons and their wives. Theheroof the story is Greatheart, a servant of the Interpreter, who is the pilgrims' guide to the Celestial City. He kills four giants called Giant Grim, Giant Maul, Giant Slay-Good, and Giant Despair and participates in the slaying of a monster called Legion that terrorizes the city of Vanity Fair.

When Christiana's party leaves Gaius's Inn and Mr. Feeble-Mind lingers in order to be left behind, he is encouraged to accompany the party by Greatheart. Christiana, Matthew, Samuel, Joseph, James, Mercy, Greatheart, Old Mr. Honest, Mr. Feeble-Mind, Mr. Ready-To-Halt, Phoebe, Grace, and Martha come to Bypath-Meadow and, after much fight and difficulty, slay the cruel Giant Despair and the wicked Giantess Diffidence, and demolish Doubting Castle for Christian and Hopeful who were oppressed there. They free a pale man named Mr. Despondency and his daughter named Much-Afraid from the castle's dungeons.

When the pilgrims end up in the Land of Beulah, they cross over the River of Death by appointment. As a matter of importance to Christians of Bunyan's persuasion reflected in the narrative ofThe Pilgrim's Progress, the last words of the pilgrims as they cross over the River of Death are recorded. The four sons of Christian and their families do not cross but remain for the support of the church in that place.

Scholars have pointed out that Bunyan may have been influenced in the creation of places inThe Pilgrim's Progressby his own surrounding environment. Albert Foster[22]describes the natural features ofBedfordshirethat apparently turn up inThe Pilgrim's Progress.Vera Brittainin her thoroughly researched biography of Bunyan,[23]identifies seven locations that appear in theallegory. Other connections are suggested in books not directly associated with either John Bunyan orThe Pilgrim's Progress.[citation needed]

At least twenty-one natural or man-made geographical or topographical features fromThe Pilgrim's Progresshave been identified—places and structures John Bunyan regularly would have seen as a child and, later, in his travels on foot or horseback. The entire journey from The City of Destruction to the Celestial City may have been based on Bunyan's own usual journey fromBedford, on the main road that runs less than a mile behind his cottage inElstow, throughAmpthill,DunstableandSt Albans, to London.

In the same sequence as these subjects appear inThe Pilgrim's Progress, the geographical realities are as follows:

The Pilgrim's Progresswas much more popular than its predecessors. Bunyan's plain style breathes life into the abstractions of theanthropomorphizedtemptations and abstractions that Christian encounters and with whom he converses on his course to Heaven.[according to whom?]Samuel Johnsonsaid that "this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing". Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted incolonial America, and was widely read in thePuritancolonies. The book was often divided into smaller parts or individual episodes that could be made into individual sermons, postcards, or wall charts. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Religious Tract Society produced the book into Sunday School prize editions and cheap abridgments. There were also Bunyan inspired jigsaw puzzles, and some followers crafted their landscapes in Bunyan theme parks.[9]

Because of its English Protestant theology,The Pilgrim's Progressshares the then-popular English antipathy toward theCatholic Church. It was published over the years of thePopish Plot(1678–1681) and ten years before theGlorious Revolutionof 1688, and it shows the influence ofJohn Foxe'sActs and Monuments. Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named "Pope":

When Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair, Bunyan adds the editorial comment:

In the Second Part, while Christiana and her group of pilgrims led by Greatheart stay for some time in Vanity, the city is terrorized by a seven-headed beast[45]which is driven away by Greatheart and other stalwarts.[46]In his endnotes, W. R. Owens notes about the woman that governs the beast: "This woman was believed by Protestants to represent Antichrist, the Church of Rome. In a posthumously published treatise,Of Antichrist, and his Ruine(1692), Bunyan gave an extended account of the rise and (shortly expected) fall of Antichrist."[47]

"The Pilgrim's Progresshas been translated into 200 languages", including Dutch in 1681, German in 1703, and Swedish in 1727, as well as over eighty African languages.[which?][48]In 1681, the first North American edition was issued. In addition, there were nine translations in Southeast Asia, twenty four translations in South Asia, and another eleven in Australasia and the Pacific.[49]Beginning in the 1850s, illustrated versions ofThe Pilgrim's Progressin Chinese were printed inHong Kong,ShanghaiandFuzhouand widely distributed by Protestant missionaries.Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Christianity-inspiredTaiping Rebellion, declared that the book was his favorite reading.[50]

Henry Alfred Krishnapillai'smagnum opus,Ratchanya Yaathrigam(The Journey of Salvation) is an adaptation ofThe Pilgrim's Progressin theTamil languageand is considered one of the finest Tamil literary works of the 19th century.Paradeshi Mokshayathraby Rev.K. Koshy/Rev. Joseph Peet (1844), andSanchariyude Prayanam(1846) by Rev. C. Muller/Rev. P. Chandran are allegorical translations inMalayalamand are one of theearliest prose worksin the language.[51]

In Turkish, translations of the book appeared in Greek script in 1879, and in Armenian script in 1881.

The literal textual meaning ofThe Pilgrim's Progresswas also adapted by young converts and missionaries to make sense in different cultural contexts.[49]"For example, Kele Protestants in the Congo omitted the sections that explained original sin" since "this idea was incompatible with their cultural assumptions."[49]The Pilgrim's Progresswas also adapted to be relevant for non-Europeans, by tailoring the story to make sense of their own experiences. Heaven was often a place designed to resemble what they had gone through in life. For example, in the American Southern Black culture, Bunyan was changed to be a black protagonist who "was redeemed not only from sin but also slavery."[49]Similarly, a version was written where theinjustices which took placein South Africa were reformulated.[52]

There are collections of old foreign language versions ofThe Pilgrim's Progressat both theMoot Hall Museumin Elstow, and at theJohn Bunyan Museumin Mill Street in Bedford.

The Third Part of the Pilgrim's Progresswas written by an anonymous author; beginning in 1693, it was published with Bunyan's authentic two parts. It continued to be republished with Bunyan's work until 1852.[53]This third part presented the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions.

The book was the basis of a condensed radio adaptation, originally presented in 1942 and starringJohn Gielgud, which included, as background music, several excerpts fromRalph Vaughan Williams' orchestral works.[citation needed]

The book was the basis ofThe Pilgrim's Progress(opera)by Vaughan Williams, premiered in 1951.

The radio version was newly recorded byHyperion Recordsin 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best. It again starred Gielgud, and featuredRichard PascoandUrsula Howells.[citation needed]

English composerErnest Austinset the whole story as a hugenarrativetone poemfor soloorgan, with optional 6-partchoirandnarrator, lasting approximately2+1⁄2hours.[when?][citation needed]

Under the nameThe Similitude of a Dream, the progressive rock band ofNeal Morsereleased a concept album based onThe Pilgrim's Progressin November 2016. A sequel, entitledThe Great Adventure, focusing on Christian's son Joseph, was released in January 2019. Both albums received critical acclaim.

A number of illustrations created by Henry Melville appear in the Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books under the editorship ofLetitia Elizabeth Landon. Each is accompanied by a poem, either byBernard Bartonor by Miss Landon herself. These plates are as follows:

The Pilgrim's Progresswas a favourite subject among painters in 1840s America, including major figures of theHudson River Schooland others associated with theNational Academy of Design.Daniel Huntington,Jasper Cropsey,Frederic Edwin Church,Jesse Talbot,Edward Harrison May, and others completed canvases based on the work.Thomas Cole'sThe Voyage of Lifewas inspired byThe Pilgrim's Progress.[63]

In 1850, Huntington, Cropsey, and Church contributed designs to amoving panoramabased onThe Pilgrim's Progress, conceptualized by May and fellow artist Joseph Kyle, which debuted in New York and travelled all over the country.[64]A second version of the panorama, organized by Kyle and artist Jacob Dallas, premiered in 1851.[65]The second version exists today in the collections of theSaco Museum.

InWole Soyinka's novelChronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth(2021), the third chapter is entitled 'Pilgrim's Progress'. In describes the travels of the character Dennis Tibidje. He encounters John Bunyan's bookPilgrim's Progresswhile detained as an illegal immigrant in New Jersey.

Charles Dickens' bookOliver Twist(1838) is subtitled 'The Parish Boy's Progress'. The titular character ofThe Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby(1839) and his companion Smike start to read it but are interrupted.

The title ofWilliam Makepeace Thackeray's 1847–1848 novelVanity Fairalludes to the location in Bunyan's work.

Mark Twaingave his 1869 travelogue,The Innocents Abroad, the alternative titleThe New Pilgrims' Progress. In Twain's later workAdventures of Huckleberry Finn,the titular charactermentionsThe Pilgrim's Progressas he describes the works of literature in the Grangerfords' library. Twain uses this to satirize the Protestant Southern aristocracy.

E. E. Cummingsmakes numerous references to it in his prose work,The Enormous Room.

Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, "The Celestial Railroad", recreates Christian's journey in Hawthorne's time. Progressive thinkers have replaced the footpath by a railroad, and pilgrims may now travel under steam power. The journey is considerably faster, but somewhat more questionable. Hawthorne's novelThe Scarlet Letteralso makes reference to it, by way of the authorJohn Bunyanwith a metaphor comparing a main character's eyes with the fire depicted in the entrance to Hell inThe Pilgrim's Progress.

John Buchanwas an admirer of Bunyan's, andPilgrim's Progressfeatures significantly in his thirdRichard Hannaynovel,Mr. Standfast, which also takes its title from one of Bunyan's characters.

Alan Moore, in hisLeague of Extraordinary Gentlemen, enlistsThe Pilgrim's Progressprotagonist, Christian, as a member of the earliest version of this group,Prospero's Men, having become wayward on his journey during his visit in Vanity Fair, stepping down an alleyway and found himself in London in the 1670s, and unable to return to his homeland. This group disbanded in 1690 after Prospero vanished into theBlazing World; however, some parts of the text seem to imply that Christian resigned from Prospero's League before its disbanding and that Christian travelled to the Blazing World before Prospero himself. The apparent implication is that; within the context of the League stories; the Celestial City Christian seeks and the Blazing World may in fact be one and the same.[citation needed]

InLouisa May Alcott'sLittle Women, the protagonist Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the novel, and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times toPilgrim's Progressand liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. A number of chapter titles directly reference characters and places fromPilgrim's Progress.

The cartoonistWinsor McCaydrew an allegorical comic strip, entitledA Pilgrim's Progress, in theNew York Evening Telegram. The strip ran from 26 June 1905 to 18 December 1910. In it, the protagonist Mr. Bunion is constantly frustrated in his attempts to improve his life by ridding himself of his burdensome valise, "Dull Care".[66]

C. S. Lewiswrote a book inspired byThe Pilgrim's Progress, calledThe Pilgrim's Regress, in which a character named John follows a vision to escape from The Landlord, a less friendly version of The Owner inThe Pilgrim's Regress. It is an allegory of C. S. Lewis' own journey from a religious childhood to a pagan adulthood in which he rediscovers his Christian God.

Henry Williamson'sThe Patriot's Progressreferences the title ofThe Pilgrim's Progressand the symbolic nature of John Bunyan's work. The protagonist of thesemi-autobiographicalnovel is John Bullock, the quintessential English soldier during World War I.

The character ofBilly PilgriminKurt Vonnegut's novelSlaughterhouse-5: The Children's Crusadeis a clear homage to a similar journey to enlightenment experienced by Christian, although Billy's journey leads him to anexistentialacceptance of life and of afatalisthuman condition. Vonnegut's parallel toThe Pilgrim's Progressis deliberate and evident in Billy's surname.

Charlotte Brontërefers toPilgrim's Progressin most of her novels, includingJane Eyre,[67]Shirley,[68]andVillette.[69]Her alterations to the quest-narrative have led to much critical interest, particular with the ending ofJane Eyre.[70]

Walt WillisandBob Shaw's classicscience fiction fannovelette,The Enchanted Duplicator, is explicitly modeled onThe Pilgrim's Progressand has been repeatedly reprinted over the decades since its first appearance in 1954: inprofessional publications, infanzines, and as amonograph.

Enid BlytonwroteThe Land of Far Beyond(1942) as a children's version ofThe Pilgrim's Progress.

John Steinbeck's novelThe Grapes of WrathmentionsThe Pilgrim's Progressas one of an (anonymous) character's favorite books. Steinbeck's novel was itself an allegorical spiritual journey by Tom Joad through America during theGreat Depression, and often made Christian allusions to sacrifice and redemption in a world of social injustice.

The book was commonly referenced in African Americanslave narratives, such as "Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom" byEllen and William Craft, to emphasize the moral and religious implications of slavery.[71]

Hannah Hurnard's novelHinds' Feet on High Places(1955) uses a similar allegorical structure toThe Pilgrim's Progressand takes Bunyan's character Much-Afraid as its protagonist.

InLois McMaster Bujold'sThe Borders of Infinity(1989),Miles Vorkosiganuses half a page torn fromThe Pilgrim's Progressas a coded message to his fleet to rescue him and 9,000 others from a POW camp.

Sir Walter Scottuses Bunyan's tale in chapter 32 of his novelThe Heart of Midlothian(1818) to illustrate the relationship between Madge Wildfire andJeanie Deans. Madge explains: "But it is all over now.—But we'll knock at the gate and then the keeper will admit Christiana, but Mercy will be left out—and then I'll stand at the door trembling and crying, and then Christiana—that's you, Jeanie,—will intercede for me. And then Mercy,—that's me, ye ken,—will faint[.]"

InMarguerite Young's novel,Miss MacIntosh, My Darling, the titular character always carries a copy ofPilgrim's Progresswith her. The structure of the novel is inspired byPilgrim's Progresstoo, being composed largely of the narrator's seemingly omniscient reminiscences about other characters' inner lives and dreams.

InGeorge Eliot's novelMiddlemarch, a lengthy quotation from the conclusion of the trial of Faithful in Vanity Fair serves as the epigraph to Chapter 85.
