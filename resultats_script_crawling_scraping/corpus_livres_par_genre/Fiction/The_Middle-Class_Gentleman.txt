The play takes place at Mr. Jourdain's house inParis. Jourdain is a middle-aged "bourgeois" whose father grew rich as acloth merchant. The foolish Jourdain now has one aim in life, which is to rise above this middle-class background and be accepted as anaristocrat. To this end, he orders splendid new clothes and is very happy when the tailor's boy mockingly addresses him as "my Lord". He applies himself to learning the gentlemanly arts of fencing, dancing, music and philosophy, despite his age; in doing so he continually manages to make a fool of himself, to the disgust of his hired teachers. His philosophy lesson becomes a basic lesson on language in which he is surprised and delighted to learn that he has been speakingproseall his life without knowing it.

Madame Jourdain, his intelligent wife, sees that he is making a fool of himself and urges him to return to his previous middle-class life, and to forget all he has learned. A cash-strapped nobleman called Dorante has attached himself to M. Jourdain. He secretly despises Jourdain but flatters his aristocratic dreams. For example, by telling Jourdain that he mentioned his name to theKingatVersailles, he can get Jourdain to pay his debts. Jourdain's dreams of being upper-class go higher and higher. He dreams of marrying aMarchioness, Dorimène, and having his daughter Lucile marry a nobleman. But Lucile is in love with the middle-class Cléonte. Of course, M. Jourdain refuses his permission for Lucile to marry Cléonte.

Then Cléonte, with the assistance of his valet Covielle and Mme Jourdain, disguises himself and presents himself to Jourdain as the son of theSultan of Turkey. Jourdain is taken in and is very pleased to have his daughter marry foreign royalty. He is even more delighted when the "Turkish prince" informs him that, as father of the bride, he too will be officially ennobled at a special ceremony. The play ends with this ridiculous ceremony, including theSabirlanguage standing in for Turkish.

The original production brought together the finest actors and musicians of the time. Molière played the role of Monsieur Jourdain, clothed in bright colors trimmed with silver lace and multicolored feathers; André Hubert played Madame Jourdain (travesti); Mlle de Brie played Dorimène;Armande Béjartplayed Lucile; and the composerJean-Baptiste Lullydanced themuftiin the last actcérémonie des Turcs.

Le Bourgeois gentilhommereflected the then-current trend forles turqueries,all things related to theOttoman Empire. The work stemmed from the scandal caused by the Turkish ambassadorSuleiman Agawho, upon visiting the court ofLouis XIVin 1669, affirmed the superiority of the Ottoman court over that of the Sun King.

The first performance ofDer Bürger als Edelmann, a German version of the play, took place on 25 October 1912,adaptedbyHugo von Hofmannsthalwithincidental musicbyRichard Strauss. Theturqueriewas replaced by an appendedoperaticentertainmentAriadne auf Naxos, composed by Strauss to alibrettoby Hofmannsthal, in which Jourdain's eccentric requirements have led toAriadnebeing marooned on a desert island where there just happens to be acommedia dell'artetroupe. The production was directed byMax Reinhardt. The combination of play and opera proved problematic. Hofmannsthal created a revised version of the play, reinstating theturquerieand removing the opera. Strauss provided further incidental music including some arrangements of Lully. Meanwhile, the entertainment was provided with a separate operatic prologue and this is the form in whichAriadneis now usually given.[2]

George Balanchinechoreographed a number ofmodern versions, from the 1930s to the 1970s, using Strauss's score. The first version was performed in 1932 byWassily de BasilandRené Blum'sBallet Russe de Monte-Carlo, featuringDavid LichineandTamara Toumanova, with sets byAlexandre Benois.[3]In 1944, a new version of the ballet was performed by the second iteration of theBallet Russe de Monte-Carlo, withNicholas Magallanes(taking over for an injuredFrederic Franklin),Maria Tallchief, andNathalie Krassovska.[3]The most well-known version, from 1979 for theNew York City Opera, featured input fromJerome Robbins, who stepped in during a period of Balanchine's illness.[3]Peter Martinsalso choreographed one scene near the end of the ballet.[4]The production starredJean-Pierre Bonnefoux,Patricia McBride,Rudolf Nureyev,Darla Hoover,Michael Puleoand students of theSchool of American Ballet.

In 2005Le Poème Harmoniquein collaboration withBenjamin Lazar[fr](stage director) andCécile Roussat[fr](choreographer) presentedLe Bourgeois gentilhommeat the Utrecht Baroque Festival. Informed by the musical and theatrical traditions of 17th century France, the production revived the musical and dance interludes originally scored byJean-Baptiste Lullyand the work was presented in its entirety. The wardrobe was notably bourgeois and ridiculous, evidently the intent of the directors to present Monsieur Jordain as a naive, stunned and yet vulnerable man new to the world of money and privilege "victim and architect of the action". The use of candlelight as the only lighting source on stage and a frontal performance style even during conversations between characters gave the production a distinctly baroque air and was well received. The 2005 production was the first ever since the play's first performance to render it in its entirety, as faithful as possible to the original score and script by Molière and Lully.

Many male and female musicians, instrumentalists, dancers, cooks, tailor's apprentices, and others are needed for the interludes.

An hour-long version adapted by Harry McFadden was broadcast on theNBC radioseriesGreat Playson December 18, 1938.[citation needed]
