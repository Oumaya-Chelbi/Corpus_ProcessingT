The story is narrated in thefirst personas an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm with his mother, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country. Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness. Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty's life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal ofverisimilitude.[1]

The book describes conditions among London horse-drawncabdrivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixedfares. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day cab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day cab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the cab licence fee was much reduced.

Black Beautyis considered to be one of the first fictional animal autobiographies.[9]Originally meant to be informative literature read by adults on the norms of horse cruelty and preventions of these unjust acts,Black Beautyis now seen as a children's book.[10]Narrated by the main character, Black Beauty, the novel is read by thousands of children worldwide.[11]

Sewell usesanthropomorphisminBlack Beauty. The text advocates the fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England. The story is narrated from Black Beauty's perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the "bearing rein" and "blinkers" as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses. For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the "bearing rein" to Black Beauty, by stating, "it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don't know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips".[12]Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty's story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves. The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings. Coslett emphasizes that, whileBlack Beautyis not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that "allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide".[13]Dwyer suggests that  "by the end of the nineteenth century the concern for animal welfare was often mediated by considerations of utility", implying that these animals (horses) were seen to get the job done by any means rather than the approach that they could be demonizing the animal.[14][clarification needed]

Published in 1877, in the last years of Anna Sewell's life,Black Beautysold over 50 million copies worldwide in 50 different languages.[15]This different viewpoint sparked people's interest to speak for horses' well-being and implement legislation.[16]According to Sewell, providing information was her original goal of horse injustice.[1]Although the shift of perspectives was seen as good for some, it was also an issue to others including horse owners and people who sold such equipment for horses (equipment like blinders).[17]It has been alleged thatBlack Beautywas banned in some countries, e.g. South Africa, for containing the words "Black" and "Beauty" during its apartheid restrictions on African natives.[18]However, Claire Datnow, in her memoirBehind the Walled Garden of Apartheid: Growing up White in Segregated South Africa,[19]writes that this "fact" was a standing joke among her circle of friends, invented to make fun of the "ignorance of the censors"—the idea being thatBlack Beautyhad been banned "because the censors thought it referred to a black woman."

Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimized horses, sympathized and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses. Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies ofBlack Beautywere in circulation in the United States.[20]In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables.[21]The depiction of the "bearing rein" inBlack Beautyspurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly. The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses inBlack Beautyinspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals.[22]The impact of the novel is still very much recognized today. Writing in theEncyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, Bernard Unti callsBlack Beauty"the most influential anti-cruelty novel of all time".[23]Comparisons have also been made betweenBlack Beautyand the most importantsocial protest novelin the United States,Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.[22]

The book has been adapted into film and television several times, including:

Black Beautywas adapted for the stage in 2011 by playwright James Stone. The play was performed at the Broughton Hall Estate, North Yorkshire and Epsom Racecourse, Surrey. The production was a critical success and was performed around the UK in 2012.[28]
