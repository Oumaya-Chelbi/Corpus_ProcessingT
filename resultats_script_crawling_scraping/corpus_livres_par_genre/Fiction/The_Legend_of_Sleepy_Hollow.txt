The story is set in 1790 in the countryside near the formerDutch settlementofTarry Town, in a secludedglenknown asSleepy Hollow. It relates the tale ofIchabod Crane, a lean, lanky, superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut. Ichabod intends to woo Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, in order to procure her family's riches for himself. He competes for her affection with Abraham "Brom Bones" Van Brunt, the town rowdy. Unable to goad Ichabod into fighting for Katrina's hand, Brom instead wages a campaign of harassment against the schoolmaster, plaguing him with a series of pranks and practical jokes.

One autumn night, Ichabod is invited to attend a harvest party at the Van Tassel homestead. At the party, Brom tells the story of the Headless Horseman, the notorious ghost of aHessian trooperdecapitated by a cannonball during theRevolutionary War. The Horseman is supposedly buried in a churchyard in Sleepy Hollow and rises from his grave every night to search for his missing head but is supernaturally barred from crossing a wooden bridge that spans a nearby stream.

Katrina rejects Ichabod before he leaves. He leaves the party crestfallen and rides home on a borrowed plow horse named Gunpowder. He encounters a cloaked rider and believes it to be the Headless Horseman. Ichabod rides for his life with the apparition close behind. At the bridge, the Horseman rears his horse and hurls his severed head directly at Crane, knocking him off his horse.

The next morning, Gunpowder is found eating the grass at his master's gate, but Ichabod has disappeared from the area, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones. Although the true nature of both the Headless Horseman and Ichabod's disappearance is left open to interpretation, it is implied that the Horseman was actually Brom. A shattered pumpkin is found near Ichabod's hat where he fell, suggesting that the severed head thrown at him was merely ajack-o'-lanternand that Crane survived the fall from Gunpowder and fled Sleepy Hollow in horror.

In a postscript, a Mr. Knickerbocker recounts hearing the tale at a Corporation meeting in Manhattan, narrated by a humorous, shabby gentleman. The story ends with mixed reactions from the audience, including laughter and skepticism. A serious old gentleman questions the moral of the story, to which the storyteller humorously responds that the tale proves life's situations have their advantages if one can find humor in them. The old gentleman remains puzzled, and the storyteller admits he doesn't believe half of the story himself.

The story was the longest one published as part ofThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.(commonly referred to asThe Sketch Book), which Irving issued serially throughout 1819 and 1820, using the pseudonym "Geoffrey Crayon".[2]Irving wroteThe Sketch Bookduring a tour of Europe, and parts of the tale may also be traced to European origins. Headless horsemen were staples ofnorthern Europe storytelling, featured in German, Irish (e.g.,Dullahan), Scandinavian (e.g.,the Wild Hunt), and British legends, and included inRobert Burns's Scots poem "Tam o' Shanter" (1790) andGottfried August Bürger'sDer Wilde Jäger(1778), translated asThe Wild Huntsman(1796). Usually viewed as omens of ill fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions, these specters found their victims in proud, scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance.[3]One particularly influential rendition of this folktale is the last of the "Legenden von Rübezahl" ('Legends ofRübezahl') fromJohann Karl August Musäus's literary retellings of German folktales,Volksmärchen der Deutschen(1783).[4]

After theBattle of White Plainsin October 1776, the country south of theBronx Riverwas abandoned by theContinental Armyand occupied by theBritish. The Americans were fortified north ofPeekskill, leavingWestchester Countya 30-mile stretch of scorched and desolated no-man's-land, vulnerable to outlaws, raiders, and vigilantes. Besides droves of Loyalist rangers and British light infantry, HessianJägers—renowned sharpshooters and horsemen—were among the raiders who often skirmished with Patriot militias.[5]The Headless Horseman may have indeed been based loosely on the discovery of such a corpse found inSleepy Hollowafter a violent skirmish and later buried by the Van Tassel family in an unmarked grave in theOld Dutch Burying Ground.[6]Two possible inspirations for the Headless Horseman were two actual incidents during the October 1776 Battles of White Plains: Lt Abraham Ondernock of the Orange County Militia, was beheaded by a cannonball; during the battle of Chatterton Hill One of the veterans of the battle, Gen. William Heath, noted in his journal that he witnessed a Hessian artilleryman lose his head on October 31st.[7]

According to another hypothesis, Irving could have drawn the figure of the "headless rider" from German Silesian literature, precisely from the Chronicle ofSprottau(since 1945 Polish Szprotawa) by J.G. Kreis, written in the first half of the 19th century. In the 19th century, the police counselor Kreis noted that, in the previous century, the inhabitants of this city were afraid to move after dusk onHospitalstrasse(now Sądowa Street) due to the headless rider apparition seen there.[8]In support of the hypothesis, according to information inPolish Reception of Washington Irving's Work: Between Enlightenment and Romanticismby Zofia Sinko,Walter Scottencouraged Irving to learn German to be able to read stories, ballads, and legends in their native language.[9]

Irving, while he was anaide-de-campto New York GovernorDaniel D. Tompkins, met an army captain namedIchabod CraneinSackets Harbor, New York, during an inspection tour of fortifications in 1814. Irving may have patterned the character afterJesse Merwin, who taught at the local schoolhouse inKinderhook, further north along theHudson River, where Irving spent several months in 1809.[10]Alternatively, it is claimed by many inTarrytownthatSamuel Youngsis the individual from whom Irving drew his character.[11]AuthorGary Dennissasserts that while Crane is loosely based on Merwin, it may include elements from Youngs's life.[12]

With "Rip Van Winkle", "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is one of Irving's most anthologized, studied, and adapted sketches. Both stories are often paired together in books and other representations, and both are included in surveys of earlyAmerican literatureandRomanticism.[13]Irving's depictions ofregional cultureand themes of progress versus tradition,supernaturalintervention in the commonplace, and theplight of the individual outsider in a homogeneous communitypermeate both stories and helped develop a unique sense of American cultural and existential selfhood during the early 19th century.[14]

Sleepy Hollow, New York, as the setting for the story, contains many of the referenced locations, including ones that can still be visited today.Sleepy Hollow, Illinois;Sleepy Hollow, Marin County, California; andSleepy Hollow, Wyoming, have street names that reference the story. The latter hosts an annual event called Sleepy Hollow Days.[39]There is also aSleepy Hollow State ParkinLaingsburg, Michigan. The original schoolhouse inKinderhook, New York, is now owned by theColumbia County Historical Societyand called theIchabod Crane Schoolhouse.[40]The area's modern-day school district,Ichabod Crane Central School District, is also named for the character.
