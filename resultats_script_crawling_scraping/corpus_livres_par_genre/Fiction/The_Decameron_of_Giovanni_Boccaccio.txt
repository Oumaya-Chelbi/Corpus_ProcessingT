The book is structured as aframe storycontaining 100 tales told by a group of seven young women and three young men; they shelter in a secluded villa just outsideFlorencein order to escape theBlack Death, which was afflicting the city. The epidemic is likely what Boccaccio used for the basis of the book which  was thought to be written between 1348–1353. The various tales of love inThe Decameronrange from theeroticto thetragic.
