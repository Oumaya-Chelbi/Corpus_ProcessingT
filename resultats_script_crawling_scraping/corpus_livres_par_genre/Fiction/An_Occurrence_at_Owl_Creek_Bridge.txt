Peyton Farquhar, a civilian who is also a wealthy planter andslaveowner, is being prepared for execution byhangingfrom anAlabamarailroad bridge during theAmerican Civil War. Six military men and a company ofinfantrymenare present, guarding the bridge and carrying out the sentence. Farquhar thinks of his wife and children and is then distracted by a noise that, to him, sounds like an unbearably loud clanging. It is actually the ticking of his watch. He considers the possibility of jumping off the bridge and swimming to safety if he can free his tied hands, but the soldiers drop him from the bridge before he can act on the idea.

In a flash-back, Farquhar and his wife are relaxing at home one evening when a soldier dressed inConfederategray rides up to the gate. Farquhar, a supporter of the Confederacy, learns from him thatUniontroops have seized the Owl Creek railroad bridge and repaired it. The soldier suggests that Farquhar might be able to burn the bridge down if he can slip past its guards. He then leaves, but doubles back after nightfall to return north the way he came. The soldier is actually a disguised Union scout who has lured Farquhar into a trap, as any civilian caught interfering with the railroads will be hanged.

The story returns to the present, and Farquhar falls into the creek when the rope around his neck breaks. He frees his hands, pulls the noose away and rises to the surface to begin his escape. His senses now greatly sharpened, he dives and swims downstream to avoid rifle and cannon fire. Once he is out of range, he leaves the creek to begin the journey to his home thirty miles (48 kilometres) away. Farquhar walks all day through a seemingly endless forest and that night he begins to hallucinate, seeing strange constellations and hearing whispered voices in an unknown language. He travels on, urged by the thought of his wife and children despite the pains caused by his ordeal. The next morning, after having apparently fallen asleep while walking, he finds himself at the gate to his plantation. He rushes to embrace his wife, but before he can do so he feels a heavy blow upon the back of his neck. There is a loud noise and a flash of white and "then all is darkness and silence!" It is revealed that Farquhar never escaped at all. He imagined his escape and journey home during the time between falling through the bridge and the noose breaking his neck.

"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" was first published in the July 13, 1890, issue ofThe San Francisco Examinerand collected in the compilationTales of Soldiers and Civilians(1891).

Editors of a modern compilation described the story as "one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature".[2]AuthorKurt Vonnegutwrote in 2005: "I consider anybody a twerp who hasn't read the greatest American short story, which is '[An] Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,' by Ambrose Bierce. It isn't remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like 'Sophisticated Lady' byDuke Ellingtonor theFranklin stove."[4]

The real Owl Creek Bridge is in Tennessee. Bierce likely changed the setting to northern Alabama because the actual bridge did not have a railroad near it at the time of the story.[5]

The story explores the concept of "dying with dignity". It shows the reader that the perception of "dignity" provides no mitigation for the deaths that occur in warfare. It further demonstrates psychological escape right before death. Farquhar experiences an intense delusion to distract him from his inevitable death. The moment of horror that the reader experiences at the end of the piece reflects the distortion of reality that Farquhar encounters.[6]

It is not only the narrator who experiences the story but also the readers themselves. Bierce said that he detested "bad readers—readers who, lacking the habit of analysis, lack also the faculty of discrimination, and take whatever is put before them, with the broad, blindcatholicityof a slop-fed conscience of a parlor pig".[7]

The plot device of a long period of subjective time passing in an instant, such as the imagined experiences of Farquhar while falling, has been explored by several authors.[8]An early literary antecedent appears in theTang dynasty taleThe Governor of Nanke, byLi Gongzuo. Another medieval antecedent isDon Juan Manuel'sTales of Count Lucanor, Chapter XII (c.1335), "Of that which happened to a Dean of Santiago, with Don Illan, the Magician, who lived at Toledo," in which a life happens in an instant.[9][10]Charles Dickens's essay "A Visit to Newgate", wherein a man dreams he has escaped his death sentence, has been speculated as a possible source for the story.[11]Bierce's story, in turn, may have influenced "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" byErnest HemingwayandPincher MartinbyWilliam Golding.[5]

Bierce's story highlighted the idea of subjective time passing at the moment of death and popularized the fictional device of false narrative continuation, which has been in wide circulation ever since then. Notable examples of this technique from the early-to-mid 20th century includeH. G. Wells's "The Door in the Wall" (1906) and "The Beautiful Suit" (1909),Vladimir Nabokov's "Details of a Sunset" (1924) and "The Aurelian" (1930),Jorge Luis Borges's "The Secret Miracle" (1944) and "The South" (1949),William Golding'sPincher Martin(1956),Paul Auster'sLulu on the Bridge(1998),Claude Chabrol'sAlice or The Last Escapade(1977),Terry Gilliam'sBrazil(1985) as well asJulio Cortázar's "The Island at Midday", andLeo Perutz's "From Nine to Nine".Alexander Lernet-Holenia's novellaDer Baron Bagge(1936) shares many similarities with Bierce's story, including the setting in the midst of a war and the bridge as a symbol for the moment of passage from life to death.

Among more recent works,David Lynch's later films have been compared to "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge", although they also have been interpreted asMöbius stripstorylines.[12][13]A particularly strong inspiration for the 1990 filmJacob's Ladder, for bothBruce Joel RubinandAdrian Lyne, wasRobert Enrico's 1962 short filmAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,[14]one of Lyne's favorite movies.[15]Tobias Wolff's short story "Bullet in the Brain" (1995) reveals the protagonist's past through relating what he remembers—and does not—in the millisecond after he is fatally shot.John Shirley's 1999 short story "Occurrence at Owl Street Ridge" about a depressed housewife is modeled after Bierce's story and Bierce plays a minor role in it.

Critics have noted a similar final act in the 1985 filmBrazil.[16]In the 2005 filmStay(withEwan McGregor,Naomi WattsandRyan Gosling; directed byMarc Forster; written byDavid Benioff) the entire story takes place in a character's mind after a tragic accident. Similar to Bierce's story, in theBoardwalk Empireepisode "Farewell Daddy Blues" (2013),Richard Harrowhallucinates a long journey home to his family before his death is revealed.[17]In an interview with Afterbuzz,Teen Wolfwriter and creatorJeff Davissaid that the final sequence of theSeason 3finale (2014) was inspired by "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge."

An episode of the British TV seriesBlack Mirrorfollowed a similar plot. In the episode "Playtest", Cooper tests a revolutionary video game that causes him to confuse the game with reality. Similar to Bierce's protagonist, it is revealed at the end that the entire sequence of events has taken place in the short span of his death. InScrubs,the episode "My Occurrence" has a similar plot structure, where the main character J.D. believes that a clerical mistake was made with his patient Ben. J.D. spends the entire episode trying to get it rectified, only to realize at the end that this was all a fantasy to avoid the reality that Ben had been diagnosed with leukemia. The episode's title is also a reference to the story.

The filmGhosts of Waris about a group of soldiers who find themselves in a time loop. In one scene, one of the main characters briefly tells his fellow soldiers aboutAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, implying that they may be going through a similar situation. It is later revealed that they are in fact part of an experiment and the entire situation is taking place in their minds. The broken hangman's knot and lost traveler cliché figure into the plot for the movieFrom Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughterin which Ambrose Bierce is a character.

The story has also influenced music. For example, the fourteenth track onBressa Creeting Cake'sself-titled 1997 album is entitled "Peyton Farquhar". The heavy metal bandDeceasedretold the tale in the song "The Hanging Soldier" on its 2000 albumSupernatural Addiction. Adam Young has said that the story was the inspiration for the name of his 2007 electronica musical project,Owl City.[18]TheDoobie Brotherssong "I Cheat The Hangman" was inspired by the story according its composer,Patrick Simmons. The song Mendokusai onTellison's2015 albumHope Fading Nightlyfeatures the refrain "We are all broken necked, swinging from the timbers of Owl Creek Bridge."

Several adaptations of "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" have been produced.
