Victor Frankenstein, son of an upper-classGenevesefamily, spends his youth obsessed withalchemy. As he grows older, he develops an interest in modern sciences such aschemistryandelectricity. After his mother Caroline dies ofscarlet fever, Victor leaves home to attend theUniversity of Ingolstadt. Through his studies, Victor discovers a new way to create life, which he uses to create alarge and grotesque humanoid creature. Whenthe creatureawakens, Victor flees in terror. He returns to find the creature gone.

The newly conscious creature runs away, discovers fire, and learns to avoid humans, who find him frightening. He finds ahovelattached to a small house, which lets him observe a family while remaining unseen. As the family teaches their language to a foreigner, the creature also learns to speak and write. He also finds a collection of books, includingParadise Lost, and learns to read. When he finally reveals himself to the family, they are horrified by his appearance and chase him away. The creature then saves a young girl from drowning, only to be shot by her father, who perceives his rescue as an attack.

Angry at humanity, the creature returns to Geneva to find Victor, and instead meets Victor's brother William. Realizing that William belongs to the same family, the creature kills him, then frames the Frankensteins' servant Justine for his death. Victor suspects his creature was responsible, but does not intervene while Justine is tried and executed. Later, while hiking onMer de Glace, Victor encounters the creature again. The creature relays his story and asks Victor to create a female companion, which he believes will be his only chance at happiness. Victor agrees.

Victor and his friend Henry Clerval leave the European mainland forBritain, where Victor establishes a laboratory inOrkney. While working on the female creature, Victor worries about his creations giving birth, and decides to destroy the incomplete female instead. In retaliation, the original creature murders Henry. Victor suffers a mental breakdown, then returns home. Back in Geneva, Victor marries his childhood friendElizabeth Lavenza, only for the creature to murder her on the wedding night. Days later, Victor's father Alphonse dies of grief. With no remaining family, Victor vows revenge and pursues the creature, eventually following him to theArctic.

Chasing the creature across Arctic ice, Victor nearly dies from exhaustion andhypothermia. He is rescued by Captain Robert Walton, who is leading an expedition to the North Pole. Victor recounts his story to Walton and encourages the crew to continue their expedition; instead, they decide to abandon their journey and turn back. Victor vows to continue chasing the creature, but in his weakened state, he dies aboard the ship. As the ship leaves the Arctic, the creature comes onboard. He mourns Victor's death, tells Walton he plans to burn himself on a pyre, and then departs to build a pyre.

Mary Shelley's mother,Mary Wollstonecraft, died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her. Shelley grew close to her father,William Godwin, having never known her mother. Godwin hired a nurse, who briefly cared for her and her half sister, before marrying his second wifeMary Jane Clairmont, who did not like the close bond between Shelley and her father. The resulting friction caused Godwin to favour his other children.

Shelley's father was a famous author of the time, and her education was of great importance to him, although it was not formal. Shelley grew up surrounded by her father's friends, writers, and persons of political importance, who often gathered at the family home. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Mary, at the age of sixteen, met Percy Bysshe Shelley (who later became her husband) while he was visiting her father. Godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older, married man, so they fled to France along with her stepsister,Claire Clairmont. On 22 February 1815, Shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child, Clara, who died two weeks later.[10]

In thesummer of 1816, Mary, Percy, and Claire took a trip to visit Claire's lover, Lord Byron, inGeneva. Poor weather conditions, more akin to winter, forced Byron and the visitors to stay indoors. To help pass time, Byron suggested that he, Mary, Percy, and Byron's physician,John Polidori, have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors.[11]Mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation ofFrankenstein.[12][13]

Shelley's work was heavily influenced by that of her parents. Her father was famous forEnquiry Concerning Political Justiceand her mother famous forA Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Her father's novels also influenced her writing ofFrankenstein. These novels includedThings as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams,St. Leon, andFleetwood. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting inFrankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear inFrankensteinarePygmalionet Galatéeby Mme de Genlis, andOvid, with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society.[14]Ovid also inspires the use ofPrometheusin Shelley's title.[15]

The influence ofJohn Milton'sParadise LostandSamuel Taylor Coleridge'sThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerare evident in the novel. InThe Frankenstein of the French Revolution, author Julia Douthwaite posits that Shelley probably acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character fromHumphry Davy's bookElements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that,

References to theFrench Revolutionrun through the novel; a likely source isFrançois-Félix Nogaret[fr]'sLe Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant(1790), a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn, who creates a life-sized automaton.[16]

Both Frankenstein and the monster quote passages from Percy Shelley's 1816 poem, "Mutability", and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. Percy Shelley's name never appeared as the author of the poem, although the novel credits other quoted poets by name.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1798) is associated with the theme of guilt andWilliam Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" (1798) with that of innocence.

Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then-popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work because of several notable similarities. Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries wereGiovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London,[17]andJohann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

Ideas about life and death discussed by Percy and Byron were of great interest to scientists of that time. They discussed ideas fromErasmus Darwinand the experiments ofLuigi Galvanias well asJames Lind.[18]Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin, Galvani and perhaps Lind were present in her novel.

Shelley's personal experiences also influenced the themes withinFrankenstein. The themes of loss, guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance. In a 1965 issue ofThe Journal of Religion and Healtha psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.[13]

During the rainy summer of 1816, the "Year Without a Summer", the world was locked in a long, coldvolcanic wintercaused by the eruption ofMount Tamborain 1815.[19][20]Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and future husband),Percy Bysshe Shelley, visitedLord Byronat theVilla DiodatibyLake Geneva, in Switzerland'sAlps. The weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the bookFantasmagoriana.[21]Byron proposed that they "each write a ghost story."[22]Unable to think of a story, Mary Shelley became anxious. She recalled being asked "Have you thought of a story?" each morning, and every time being "forced to reply with a mortifying negative."[23]During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated," Mary noted, "galvanismhad given token of such things".[24]It was after midnight before they retired and, unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the "grim terrors" of her "waking dream".[6]

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa in the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her "waking dream" took place between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.[26]

Mary Shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a fully-fledged novel.[27]She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment "when I first stepped out from childhood into life."[28]Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[29]This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composingFrankensteinin 1816, she was probably nursing her second child, who was also dead by the time ofFrankenstein's publication.[30]Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre ofBathin 1816.[31]

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on thevampirelegends he heard while travelling theBalkans, and from thisJohn PolidoricreatedThe Vampyre(1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.[32][33][34]

The group talked aboutEnlightenmentandCounter-Enlightenmentideas as well. Mary Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society.[35]

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as thefair copyfor her publisher, are now housed in theBodleian LibraryinOxford. The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004, and they belong now to theAbingerCollection.[36][37]In 2008, the Bodleian published a new edition ofFrankenstein, edited by Charles E. Robinson, that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley's original text with Percy Shelley's additions and interventions alongside.[38]
