The Chorus explains that Faustus was low-born, or born of low social rank, but still managed to quickly achieve a doctorate intheologyat theUniversity of Wittenberg. However, his interest in learning and his pride soon led him tonecromancy.

In the first scene of the play, Faustus expresses his boredom and impatience with the various branches of knowledge and concludes that only magic is worth learning. He asks his servant Wagner to return with the magicians Valdes and Cornelius, who have been trying to interest him in magic for some time. While he waits, he is visited by a Good Angel, who tries to dissuade him from this path, and a Bad Angel, who encourages him. Valdes and Cornelius arrive and declare that if Faustus devotes himself to magic, great things are indeed possible with someone of Faustus's learning and intelligence.

While Faustus is at dinner with the magicians, two scholars notice Faustus's absence and ask Wagner about his whereabouts. When Wagner tells them he is with Valdes and Cornelius, the scholars worry that the magicians have corrupted him and leave to inform the rector of the university.

Faustus attempts to conjure a devil, andMephistophelesarrives. Faustus believes that he has summoned him, but Mephistopheles says that he came of his own accord, and that he servesLucifer, and cannot do anything without his leave. Faustus questions Mephistopheles about Lucifer and Hell, and tells him to speak to Lucifer and return. The next scene is a comedic reflection in which Wagner calls two devils, with which he scares the Clown into serving him.

Mephistopheles returns, and Faustus signs a contract in his own blood: Mephistopheles will serve him for 24 years, at which point Lucifer will claim him, body and soul. Once the contract is signed, Faustus asks for a wife, but Mephistopheles declines, saying marriage is "but a ceremonial toy"; he asks for books of knowledge, and Mephistopheles provides a single book. In the corresponding comedic scene, Robin, ahostler, has stolen a conjuring book, and plans mischief with it.

Faustus begins to waver and think about God and is visited again by the Good and Bad Angels. Lucifer arrives to remind him of his contract and entertains him with a show of the Seven Deadly Sins. Faustus and Mephistopheles then travel Europe, eventually arriving in Rome, where they play tricks on the Pope. Next, Robin and Rafe (A version) or Dick (B version), having been caught for stealing a goblet, call on Mephistopheles, who arrives and angrily turns them into animals before returning to attend on Faustus. Faustus has been called to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, where he and Mephistopheles conjureAlexander the Greatand hisparamourand give a knightcuckold's hornsfor being aheckler. In the A version, the emperor asks Faust to relent, and he does; in the B version a longer scene follows in which the knight and his friends attack Faustus; all are given horns. In both versions, Faustus then plays tricks on a horse dealer. Faustus and Mephistopheles then put on a magic show for theDuke and Duchess of Vanholt.

When Faustus's 24 years are nearly up, he bequeaths his possessions to Wagner. He conjuresHelen of Troyfor some students, and, when he starts to think of repenting again, renews his pledge to Lucifer and asks Mephistopheles for Helen as his lover. In the final scene, Faustus admits to some scholars that he has bargained away his soul; despite their prayers, the devils come for him.

The theological implications ofDoctor Faustushave been the subject of considerable debate. Among the most complicated points of contention is whether the play supports or challenges theCalvinistdoctrine of absolute predestination, which dominated the lectures and writings of many English scholars in the latter half of the sixteenth century. According to Calvin,predestinationmeant that God, acting of his own free will, elects some people to be saved and others to be damned—thus, the individual has no control over his own ultimate fate. This doctrine was the source of great controversy because it was seen by the so-called anti-Calvinists to limit man's free will in regard to faith and salvation, and to present a dilemma in terms oftheodicy.

At the timeDoctor Faustuswas performed, this doctrine was on the rise in England, and under the direction ofPuritantheologians at Cambridge and Oxford had come to be considered the orthodox position of theChurch of England.[36]Nevertheless, it remained the source of vigorous and, at times, heated debate between Calvinist scholars, such asWilliam WhitakerandWilliam Perkins, and anti-Calvinists, such as William Barrett andPeter Baro.[37]The dispute between these Cambridge intellectuals had quite nearly reached its zenith by the time Marlowe was a student there in the 1580s, and likely would have influenced him deeply, as it did many of his fellow students.[38]

Concerning the fate of Faustus, the Calvinist concludes that his damnation was inevitable. His rejection of God and subsequent inability to repent are taken as evidence that he never really belonged to the elect but rather had been predestined from the very beginning forreprobation.[39]For the Calvinist, Faustus represents the worst kind of sinner, having tasted the heavenly gift and rejected it. His damnation is justified and deserved because he was never truly adopted among the elect. According to this view, the play demonstrates Calvin's "three-tiered concept of causation," in which the damnation of Faustus is first willed by God, then by Satan, and finally, by himself.[40]

"Ravished" by magic (1.1.112), Faustus turns to the dark arts when law, logic, science, and theology fail to satisfy him. According toCharles Nichollthis places the play firmly in the Elizabethan period when the problem of magic ("liberation or damnation?") was a matter of debate, and whenRenaissance occultismaimed at a furthering of science. Nicholl, who connects Faustus as a "studious artisan" (1.1.56) to the "hands-on experience" promoted byParacelsus, sees in the former a follower of the latter, a "magician as technologist".[12]

The play is well-known for a famous line:"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?", said by Faustus upon seeing a demon impersonatingHelen.[41]The line is a paraphrase of a statement fromLucian'sDialogues of the Dead.[42][41]It is frequently quoted out of context to convey astonishment at Helen's beauty.[41]However, inDoctor Faustus, it is said to a devil posing as Helen, and is a response to the illusion; it may even express disappointment that she is not more beautiful.[41]The German poet and polymathJohann Wolfgang von Goethere-envisioned the meeting ofFaustand Helen.  InFaust: The Second Part of the Tragedy, the union of Helen and Faust becomes a complex allegory of the meeting of the classical-ideal and modern worlds.

Religionis a central theme represented throughout the play by using Dr. Faustus to portray the struggles of religious belief and worldly knowledge. The play explores the conflict between religious piety and the temptation of earthly power and wisdom. The text is deeply rooted inChristiantheology given its references to heaven, hell, devils, and biblical characters while simultaneously portraying anti-religious imagery which in turn reflects the criticism of religion during theReformation.[43]

Faustus's fate reflects the theme of seeking redemption and salvation through a religious perspective.[44]Despite several occasions of listening to the warnings from the scholars about the consequences of his actions, Faustus continues down his path of sin. It is not until his deal with Mephistopheles must be fulfilled that he begs for God's mercy and the chance to repent. In the end, his prayers go unanswered as he is ultimately damned, highlighting the irreversible consequences of his choices.

In the past, it was assumed that the comic scenes within the play were additions by other writers and were not written by Christopher Marlowe himself. However, most scholars today consider the comic interludes an integral part of the play, regardless of their author, and so they continue to be included in print.[45]The tone of the comedic scenes throughout both A-text and B-text shows the progressive change in Faustus' ambitions, which, in turn, created various theories of the composers of the comedic lines.[46]

TheClownsand comedic figures in Marlowe'sDoctor Faustus(Wagner, Robin, and Rafe) serve as bothcomic reliefand demonstrate that anyone can access thesupernaturalregardless of their degree of experience.[47]The scenes including clown characters provide a lighter alternate outlook ofdemonicstudies.[47]Additionally, scholar Bryan Lowrance suggests thatChristopher Marloweutilizeshumorto make various positions in society easier to grasp.[48]

The first television adaptation was broadcast in 1947 by the BBC starringDavid King-Woodas Faustus andHugh Griffithas Mephistopheles.[49]In 1958, another BBC television version starredWilliam Squireas Faustus in an adaptation by Ronald Eyre intended for schools.[50]In 1961, the BBC adapted the play for television as a two-episode production starringAlan Dobieas Faustus; this production was also meant for use in schools.[51]

The play wasadapted for the screenin 1967 byRichard BurtonandNevill Coghill, who based the film on an Oxford University Dramatic Society production in which Burton starred oppositeElizabeth Tayloras Helen of Troy.

There have been several adaptations on BBC Radio and elsewhere:

TheDoctor Faustusplay was written byChristopher MarlowepostProtestant Reformation, and during the height ofElizabethan era. The religious reformation, or otherwise known as the Protestant Reformation, of the Elizabethan era helped the various religious, moral, and philosophical questions presented by Marlowe inDoctor Faustusto even be considered as legitimate, answerable questions at the time.[62]It is also believed by some that theDoctor Faustusplay tapped into some form of post reformation religious trauma for its viewers, which furthered its overall cultural significance and impact for its early audiences.[63]Doctor Faustushas raised much controversy due to Faust's alleged interaction with the demonic realm.[64]Before Marlowe, there were few authors who ventured into this kind of writing. After his play, other authors began to expand on their views of the spiritual world.[65]Marlowe also never specifies the intentions of his play, or who it was intended to be directed towards.[66]This lack of specification has since led to the increase of academic interest in both A and B texts.[67]Nonetheless, theDoctor Faustusplay also served and continues to serve as a representation for the restless, rebellious, and inquisitive minds ofRenaissancewriters and culture.[66]

Furthermore,Doctor Faustushas sparked extensive critical debate since its first performances. As Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith observe, “no Elizabethan play outside theShakespearecanon has raised more controversy” regarding its textual history, date of composition, and interpretive ambiguity. They emphasize that the centrality of the Faust legend in Western intellectual history complicates any attempt at a definitive reading of the play. Over the centuries, scholars have variously interpreted the play as a Christian morality tale, a critique of Renaissance ambition, asatireof scholasticism, and a reflection of Marlowe’s own views onreligionandhumanism.[68]
