The Forsyte Saga, first published under that title in 1922, is a series of three novels and two interludes published between 1906 and 1921 by the English authorJohn Galsworthy, who won the1932 Nobel Prize in Literature. They chronicle the vicissitudes of the leading members of a large upper-middle-class English family that is similar to Galsworthy's.[1]Only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors, its members are keenly aware of their status as "new money". The main character, thesolicitorandconnoisseurSoames Forsyte, sees himself as a "man of property" by virtue of his ability to accumulate material possessions, but that does not succeed in bringing him pleasure.
