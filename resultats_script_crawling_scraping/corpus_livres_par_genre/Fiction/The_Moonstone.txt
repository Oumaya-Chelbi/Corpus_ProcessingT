Colonel Herncastle, an unpleasant former soldier, brings the Moonstone back with him from India where he acquired it by theft and murder during theSiege of Seringapatam. Angry at his family, who shun him, he leaves it in his will as a birthday gift to his niece Rachel, thus exposing her to attack by the stone's hereditary guardians, who will stop at nothing to retrieve it.

Rachel wears the stone to her birthday party, but that night it disappears from her room. Suspicion falls on three Indian jugglers who have been near the house; on Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a localquicksand; and on Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious with Franklin Blake, with whom she has previously appeared to be enamoured, when he directs attempts to find it. Despite the efforts of Sergeant Cuff, a renownedScotland Yarddetective, the house party ends with the mystery unsolved, and the protagonists disperse.

During the ensuing year there are hints that the diamond was removed from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby, watching and waiting. Rachel's grief and isolation increase, especially after her mother dies, and she first accepts and then rejects a marriage proposal from her cousinGodfrey Ablewhite, a philanthropist who was also present at the birthday dinner and whose father owns the bank near Rachel's old family home. Finally Franklin Blake returns from travelling abroad and determines to solve the mystery. He first discovers that Rosanna Spearman's behaviour was due to her having fallen in love with him. She found evidence (a paint smear on his nightclothes) that convinced her that he was the thief and concealed it to save him, confusing the trail of evidence and throwing suspicion on herself. In despair at her inability to make him acknowledge her despite all she had done for him, she killed herself, leaving behind the smeared gown and a letter he did not receive at the time because of his hasty departure abroad.

Now believing that Rachel suspects him of the theft on Rosanna's evidence, Franklin engineers a meeting and asks her. To his astonishment she tells him she actually saw him steal the diamond and has been protecting his reputation at the cost of her own even though she believes him to be a thief and a hypocrite. With hope of redeeming himself he returns to Yorkshire to the scene of the crime and is befriended by Mr.Ezra Jennings, the assistant of Dr. Candy, the doctor. They join to continue the investigations and learn that Franklin was secretly givenlaudanumduring the night of the party (by Mr. Candy, who wanted to exact vengeance on Franklin for criticising medicine); it appears that this, in addition to his anxiety about Rachel and the diamond and other nervous irritations, caused him to take the diamond in a narcotic trance, to move it to a safe place. A re-enactment of the evening's events confirms this, but how the stone ended up in a London bank remains a mystery solved only a year after the birthday party when the stone is redeemed.

Franklin and his allies trace the claimant to a seedy waterside inn, only to discover that the Indians have got there first: the claimant is dead and the stone is gone. Under the dead man's disguise is none other than Godfrey Ablewhite, who is found to haveembezzledthe contents of atrust fundin his care and to have been facing exposure soon after the birthday party. The mystery of what Blake did while in his drugged state is solved: he encountered Ablewhite in the passageway outside Rachel's room and gave the Moonstone to him to be put back in his father's bank, from which it had been withdrawn on the morning of the party to be given to Rachel. Seeing his salvation, Ablewhite pocketed the stone instead, and pledged it assuretyfor a loan to save himself temporarily from insolvency. When he was murdered, he was on his way toAmsterdamto have the stone cut; it would then have been sold to replenish the plundered trust fund before the beneficiary inherited. The mystery is solved,Rachel and Franklin marry, and in an epilogue from Mr. Murthwaite, a noted adventurer, the reader learns of the restoration of the Moonstone to the place where it should be, in the forehead of thestatue of the godin India.

In researching the novel, Collins primarily drew on texts such asCharles William King'sThe Natural History of Precious Stones and Gems and of the Precious Metals(1865),Sir David Baird'sautobiography andJames Talboys Wheeler'sThe History of India(1867).[2]As well as this, he consulted various explorers to provide him first-hand information about Indian culture in order to increase the veracity of his book. At this early stage, the book's title wasThe Serpent's Eye.[3]

The final novel was serialised in the periodicalAll the Year Roundfrom 4 January to 8 August 1868, as well as simultaneously in the American publicationHarper's Magazine. This period was affected by several difficulties in Collins' life. His mother, Harriet Collins, died on 19 March 1868, and his presence at her bedside caused the novel to fall behind schedule. He also began to suffer a painful attack of gout, which he described in a preface to the 1871 edition as "the bitterest affliction of my life and the severest illness from which I have ever suffered".[4]To dull the pain, Collins took large amounts of laudanum, resulting in portions of the novel to be written in a drug-induced haze. He would later comment that he did not recall writing these passages.[3]Considering the substantial role the memory-altering effects of opium have in the plot of the novel, this seems significant.The Moonstonewas eventually published in book form by William Tinsley on 16 July 1868; it was dedicated to his mother.

A major theme of the novel is the intrusion of imperialism on everyday English life. Lynn Pykett argues that "the main narrative ofThe Moonstoneconcerns the disruption of the tranquility and order of genteel English life by a colonial legacy."[5]The events of the plot are set into motion by Colonel John Herncastle's unlawful theft of the Moonstone in India, and, in leaving the diamond to Rachel Verinder in his will, he is perpetuating his crime. It is only when the diamond is returned to its rightful owners that the 'curse' can be lifted. Pykett also comments that the contradictory forces of feminine passion and silence provide the conflict of the novel, "[Sergeant] Cuff is defeated by the silence of women (Rachel and Rosanna), by feminine reticence (Lady Verinder), and the failure of individual women to conform to dominant stereotypes of femininity".

The book is regarded by some as the forerunner of the modern mystery novel and thesuspensenovel.T. S. Eliotcalled it "the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels in a genre invented by Collins and not byPoe,"[6]andDorothy L. Sayerspraised it as "probably the very finest detective story ever written".[7]G. K. Chestertoncalls it "probably the best detective tale in the world".[8]Graham Greeneargues thatThe Sign of Fouris derived "a little too closely" from it.[9]It was published in 1868, later than Poe's short story mysteries "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1841) (which introduced the famous locked-room paradigm), "The Mystery of Marie Rogêt" (1842) and "The Purloined Letter" (1845). The plot also shows some parallels withThe Hermitage(1839), an earlier murder mystery story by the English novelistSarah Burney: for example, the return of a childhood companion, the sexual symbolism of defloration implied in the crime, and the almost catatonic reactions of the heroine to it.[10]The Moonstoneintroduced a number of the elements that became classic attributes of the twentieth-century detective story in novel form, as opposed to Poe's short story form. These include:

Franklin Blake, the gifted amateur, is an early example of thegentleman detective. The highly competent Sergeant Cuff, the policeman called in fromScotland Yard(whom Collins based on the real-life InspectorJonathan Whicherwho solved the murder committed byConstance Kent),[11]is not a member of the gentry and is unable to break Rachel Verinder's reticence about what Cuff knows is an inside job.The Moonstonehas also been described as perhaps the earliestpolice procedural, due to the portrayal of Cuff.[12]The social difference between Collins's two detectives is shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff befriends Gabriel Betteredge, Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries her daughter Rachel.

A number of critics have suggested that Charles Felix (pseudonym forCharles Warren Adams), in hisNotting Hill Mystery(1862–1863), first used techniques that came to define the genre.[13][14]

The Moonstonerepresents Collins's only complete reprisal of the popular "multi-narration" method that he had previously used to great effect inThe Woman in White. The sections by Gabriel Betteredge (steward to the Verinder household) and Miss Clack (a poor relative and religious crank) offer both humour and pathos through their contrast with the testimony of other narrators, at the same time constructing and advancing the novel's plot.

The novel was Collins's last great success, coming at the end of an extraordinarily productive period in which four successive novels became bestsellers. AfterThe MoonstoneCollins wrote novels containing more overt social commentary that did not achieve the same audience.

A fictionalised account of Collins's life while writingThe Moonstoneforms much of the plot ofDan Simmons's novelDrood(2009).[15]

The Moonstonehad a great influence on other authors of the time, and books inspired by Collins' work quickly began appearing.Charles Dickens'The Mystery of Edwin Drood(1870) also features the theme of opium addiction, as well as several Anglo-Indian characters.Anthony Trollope'sThe Eustace Diamonds(1873) was written to tap into the thread of popular interest that Collins' novel caused, with the central plot revolving around the investigation of stolen jewels. A later book inspired by Wilkie Collins isPhilip Pullman'sThe Ruby in the Smoke(1985).[3]

The novel was made into several silent films during the first few decades of the twentieth century. A 1909 film version,The Moonstone, was produced byWilliam Nicholas Selig, although no copies have since survived. Another silent film,The Moonstone, was directed in 1915 byFrank Hall Crane.
