The novella opens on "the sea-reach of theThames" whereCharles Marlowtells his friends that "when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago" they would have sensed "the savagery, the utter savagery" surrounding them. Marlow then relates how he became captain of a river steamboat for anivory tradingcompany. He tells of his fascination as a child for "the blank spaces" on maps, particularly in Africa. The image of a river on the map particularly drew his attention.

In a flashback, Marlow makes his way to Africa by taking passage on a steamer. He travels 30 mi (50 km) up the river to where his company's station is. Work on a railway is taking place. Marlow explores a narrow ravine, and is horrified to find himself in a place full of critically ill Africans who worked on the railroad and are now dying. Marlow must wait for ten days in the company's devastated Outer Station. Marlow meets the company's chief accountant, who tells him of aMr. Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading post, and is described as a respected first-class agent. The accountant predicts that Kurtz will go far.

Marlow departs with 60 men to travel to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he will command is based. At the station, he learns that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident. The general manager informs Marlow that he could not wait for Marlow to arrive, and tells him of a rumour that Kurtz is ill. Marlow fishes his boat out of the river and spends months repairing it. Delayed by the lack of tools and replacement parts, Marlow is frustrated by the time it takes to perform the repairs. He learns that Kurtz is resented, not admired, by the manager. Once underway, the journey to Kurtz's station takes two months.

The journey pauses for the night about 8 miles (13 km) below the Inner Station. In the morning the boat is enveloped by a thick fog. The steamboat is later attacked by a barrage of arrows, and the helmsman is killed. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers away.

After landing at Kurtz's station, a man boards the steamboat: a Russian wanderer who strayed into Kurtz's camp. Marlow learns that the natives worship Kurtz and that he has been very ill. The Russian tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and admires Kurtz even for his power and his willingness to use it. Marlow suspects that Kurtz has gone mad.

Marlow observes the station and sees a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, Kurtz appears with supporters who carry him as a ghost-like figure on a stretcher. The area fills with natives ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something and they retreat. His entourage carries Kurtz to the steamer and lays him in a cabin. The manager tells Marlow that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region because his methods are "unsound". The Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings were discussed.

After midnight, Kurtz returns to shore. Marlow finds Kurtz crawling back to the station house. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he did not accomplish more. The next day they prepare to journey back down the river.

Kurtz's health worsens during the trip. The steamboat breaks down, and while stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him weakly whisper, "The horror! The horror!" A short while later, the manager's boy announces to the crew that Kurtz has died (the famous line "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" would become theepigraphofT. S. Eliot's poem "The Hollow Men"). The next day Marlow pays little attention to Kurtz's pilgrims as they bury "something" in a muddy hole.

Returning to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the "civilised" world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée. When Marlow visits her, she is deep in mourning although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Marlow tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.

The novella was not a big success during Conrad's life.[20]When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, "Youth" and "The End of the Tether", it received the least commentary from critics.[20]F. R. Leavisreferred toHeart of Darknessas a "minor work" and criticised its "adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery".[21]Conrad did not consider it to be particularly notable;[20]but by the 1960s it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.[22]

Literary criticHarold Bloomwrote thatHeart of Darknesshad been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's "unique propensity for ambiguity".[23]InKing Leopold's Ghost(1998),Adam Hochschildwrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects ofHeart of Darkness, while paying scant attention to Conrad's accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. "Heart of Darknessis experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case".[24]Other critiques include Hugh Curtler'sAchebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness(1997).[25]The French philosopherPhilippe Lacoue-LabarthecalledHeart of Darkness"one of the greatest texts of Western literature" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on "The Horror of the West".[26]

Heart of Darknessis criticised inpostcolonialstudies, particularly by Nigerian novelistChinua Achebe.[27][28]In his 1975 public lecture "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad'sHeart of Darkness", Achebe described Conrad's novella as "an offensive and deplorable book" thatdehumanisedAfricans.[29]Achebe argued that Conrad, "blinkered ... withxenophobia", incorrectly depicted Africa as the antithesis of Europe and civilisation, ignoring the artistic accomplishments of theFang peoplewho lived in the Congo River basin at the time of the book's publication. He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that "depersonalises a portion of the human race" and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.[27][30]

Achebe's critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow's view from Conrad's, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella.[31]In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his scepticism about the moral superiority of European men.[32]Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, Marlow remarks: "After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings." Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples.[33]Jeffrey Meyersnotes that Conrad, like his acquaintanceRoger Casement, "was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from theRenaissanceto theGreat War, to attack the hypocritical justification ofcolonialismand to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa."[34]: 100–01Likewise,E.D. Morel, who led international opposition toKing Leopold II's rule in the Congo, saw Conrad'sHeart of Darknessas a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as "the most powerful thing written on the subject."[35]

Conrad scholarPeter Firchowwrites that "nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference". If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, sinceHeart of Darknessacknowledges racial distinctions "but does not suggest an essential superiority" of any group.[36][37]Achebe's reading ofHeart of Darknesscan be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad's other African story, "An Outpost of Progress", which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow.[citation needed]Masood Ashraf Rajahas suggested that Conrad's positive representation ofMuslimsin hisMalaynovels complicates these charges of racism.[38]

In 2003, Motswana scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was "the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe".[39]Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara, however, broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be "sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa".[40]The novelistCaryl Phillipsstated in 2003 that: "Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe".[41]

In his 1983 criticism, the British academic Cedric Watts criticises the insinuation in Achebe's critique—the premise that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella, as well as mentioning that Achebe's critique falls into self-contradictory arguments regarding Conrad's writing style, both praising and denouncing it at times.[29]Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison ofHeart of DarknesswithJungle Tales of Tarzan, "The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people".[42]More recent critics like Nidesh Lawtoo have stressed that the "continuities" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of "postcolonial mimesis" ties the two authors via productive mirroring inversions.[43]

Orson Wellesadapted and starred inHeart of Darknessin aCBS Radiobroadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series,The Mercury Theatre on the Air. In 1939, Welles adapted the story for his first film forRKO Pictures,[44]writing a screenplay withJohn Houseman. The story was adapted to focus on the rise of afascistdictator.[44]Welles intended to play Marlow and Kurtz[44]and it was to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It is reportedly lost. The film's prologue to be read by Welles said "You aren't going to see this picture - this picture is going to happen to you."[44]The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak ofWorld War II. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio seriesThis Is My Best. Welles scholarBret Woodcalled the broadcast of 13 March 1945, "the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast."[45]: 95, 153–156, 136–137

In 1991, Australian author/playwrightLarry Buttrosewrote and staged a theatrical adaptation titledKurtzwith the Crossroads Theatre Company,Sydney.[46]The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by theVision Australia RadioNetwork,[47]and also by the RPH –Radio Print Handicapped Networkacross Australia. In 2011, composerTarik O'Reganand librettistTom Phillipsadapted anopera of the same name, which premiered at theLinbury Theatreof theRoyal Opera Housein London.[48]A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it.[49]In 2015, an adaptation of Welles' screenplay byJamie LloydandLaurence Bowenaired onBBC Radio 4.[50]The production starredJames McAvoyas Marlow. Another BBC Radio 4 adaptation, first broadcast in 2021, transposes the action to the 21st century.[51]

In 1958, theCBStelevision anthologyPlayhouse 90(S3E7) aired a loose 90-minute television play adaptation. This version, written byStewart Stern, uses the encounter between Marlow (Roddy McDowall) and Kurtz (Boris Karloff) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son. The cast includesInga SwensonandEartha Kitt.[52]

Perhaps the best known adaptation isFrancis Ford Coppola's 1979 filmApocalypse Now, based on the screenplay byJohn Milius, which moves the story from the Congo toVietnamandCambodiaduring theVietnam War.[53]InApocalypse Now,Martin Sheenstars as Captain Benjamin L. Willard, aUS ArmyCaptain assigned to "terminate the command" of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played byMarlon Brando. A film documenting the production, titledHearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, was released in 1991. It chronicles a series of difficulties and challenges that director Coppola encountered during the making of the film, several of which mirror some of the novella's themes.

A 1993 television filmadaptation was written byBenedict Fitzgeraldand directed byNicolas Roeg. The film, which was aired byTNT, starredTim Rothas Marlow,John Malkovichas Kurtz,Isaach de Bankoléas Mfumu, andJames Foxas Gosse.[54]James Gray's 2019 science fiction filmAd Astrais loosely inspired by the events of the novel. It featuresBrad Pittas an astronaut travelling to the edge of theSolar Systemto confront and potentially kill his father (Tommy Lee Jones), who has gone rogue.[55]

In 2020,African Apocalypse, a documentary film directed and produced by Rob Lemkin and featuring Femi Nylander portrays a journey fromOxford, England toNigeron the trail of a colonial killer called CaptainPaul Voulet. Voulet's descent into barbarity mirrors that of Kurtz in Conrad'sHeart of Darkness. Nylander discovers Voulet's massacres happened at exactly the same time that Conrad wrote his book in 1899. It was broadcast by theBBCin May 2021 as an episode of theArenadocumentary series.[56]

A British animated film adaption of the novella is planned, directed by Gerald Conn. It was written by Mark Jenkins and Mary Kate O Flanagan and is produced by Gritty Realism andMichael Sheen. Kurtz is voiced by Sheen and Harlequin byAndrew Scott.[57]The animation uses sand to better convey atmosphere of the book.[58]A Brazilian animated film (2023) also adapts the novella. It is directed by Rogério Nunes and Alois Di Leo and moves the story to a near futureRio de Janeiro.[59][60][61]

The video gameFar Cry 2, released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation ofHeart of Darkness. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive "Jackal". The last area of the game is called "The Heart of Darkness".[62][63][64]

Spec Ops: The Line, released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation ofHeart of Darkness. The player assumes the role ofDelta ForceoperatorCaptain Martin Walkeras he and his team searchDubaifor survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to Joseph Conrad.[65]

T. S. Eliot's 1925 poem "The Hollow Men" quotes, as its first epigraph, a line fromHeart of Darkness: "Mistah Kurtz – he dead."[66]Eliot had planned to use a quotation from the climax of the tale as the epigraph forThe Waste Land, butEzra Poundadvised against it.[67]Eliot said of the quote that "it is much the most appropriate I can find, and somewhat elucidative."[68]BiographerPeter Ackroydsuggested that the passage inspired or at least anticipated the central theme of the poem.[69]

Chinua Achebe's 1958 novelThings Fall Apartis Achebe's response to what he saw as Conrad's portrayal of Africa and Africans as symbols: "the antithesis of Europe and therefore civilization".[70]Achebe set out to write a novel about Africa and Africans by an African. InThings Fall Apartwe see the effects of colonialism and Christian missionary endeavours on an Igbo community in West Africa through the eyes of that community's West African protagonists.

Another literary work with an acknowledged debt toHeart of DarknessisWilson Harris' 1960postcolonial novelPalace of the Peacock.[71][72][73]J. G. Ballard's 1962climate fictionnovelThe Drowned Worldincludes many similarities to Conrad's novella. However, Ballard said he had read nothing by Conrad before writing the novel, prompting literary critic Robert S. Lehman to remark that "the novel's allusion to Conrad works nicely, even if it is not really an allusion to Conrad".[74][75]

Robert Silverberg's 1970 novelDownward to the Earthuses themes and characters based onHeart of Darknessset on the alien world of Belzagor.[76]InJosef Škvorecký's 1984 novelThe Engineer of Human Souls, Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism and, there and elsewhere, Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad's concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.[77]

Timothy Findley's 1993 novelHeadhunteris an extensive adaptation that reimagines Kurtz and Marlow as psychiatrists in Toronto. The novel begins: "On a winter's day, while a blizzard raged through the streets of Toronto, Lilah Kemp inadvertently set Kurtz free from page 92 ofHeart of Darkness."[78][79]Ann Patchett's 2011 novelState of Wonderreimagines the story with the central figures as female scientists in contemporary Brazil.[80][81]
