During theAmerican Civil War, five Northernprisoners of warescape during theSiege of Richmond, Virginia, by hijacking a hydrogen-filled observation balloon.  The escapees areCyrus Smith, arailroadengineerin theUnionarmy (named Cyrus Harding inKingston's translation); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short forNebuchadnezzar);Bonadventure Pencroff, asailor(who is addressed only by his surname; in Kingston's version, he is named Pencroft); hisprotégéand adopted sonHarbert Brown(called Herbert in some translations); and thejournalistGedéon Spilett(Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus's dog "Top".a

After flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic,unknown island, described as being located at34°57′S150°30′W﻿ / ﻿34.950°S 150.500°W﻿ /-34.950; -150.500(Southern Pacific Ocean/Asian:Oceanian side), about 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) east of New Zealand and about 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) from Virginia. They name it "Lincoln Island" in honor ofAbraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks,nitroglycerin, iron, anelectric telegraph, a cave home inside a stony cliff called "Granite House", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the "Bonadventure". They start to think of themselves as colonists rather than castaways.

During their stay on the island, the "colonists" endure bad weather and domesticate anorangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseendeus ex machina, responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from adugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.

The group finds amessage in a bottledirecting them to rescue acastawayon nearbyTabor Island, who is none other thanTom Ayrton(fromIn Search of the Castaways). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.

Ayrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly evading death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contractsmalariabut is saved by a box ofquininesulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds except for a little red spot on each of them.

The island is revealed to beCaptain Nemo's hideout, and home port of theNautilus. Having escaped themaelstromat the end ofTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, theNautilussailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned theNautilusto its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an "electric gun". On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of arajaof the then-independent territory ofBundelkundand a nephew of the Indian heroTippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failedIndian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to adesert islandwith twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of theNautilusand adopted the new name of "Captain Nemo". Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo's final words are "God and my country!" ("Independence!", in Verne's original manuscript). TheNautilusis scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.b

Afterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find shelter on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the shipDuncan, which had come to rescue Ayrton, but was redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to the United States they form a new colony in Iowa, financed with Nemo's gifts.

In the United States the first English printing began inScribner's Monthly, April 1874, as a serial.[5]In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston Low, and Searle published the first British edition ofMysterious Islandin three volumes entitledDropped from the Clouds,The Abandoned, andThe Secret of the Island(195,000 words).  In November 1875 Scribner's published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator,W. H. G. Kingston, was a famous author of boys' adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator ofMysterious Islandand his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from "Smith" to "Harding"; "Smith" is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers. This became the standard translation for more than a century.

In 1876 theStephen W. Whitetranslation (175,000 words) appeared first in the columns ofThe Evening Telegraphof Philadelphia and subsequently as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book. This translation is more faithful to the original story and restores the death scene of Captain Nemo, but there is still condensation and omission of some sections such as Verne's description of how a sawmill works. In the 20th century two more abridged translations appeared: the Fitzroy Edition (Associated Booksellers, 1959) abridged by I. O. Evans (90,000 words) andMysterious Island(Bantam, 1970) abridged by Lowell Bair (90,000 words).

Except for the Complete and Unabridged Classics Series CL77 published in 1965 (Airmont Publishing Company, Inc), no other unabridged translations appeared until 2001 when the illustrated version of Sidney Kravitz appeared (Wesleyan University Press) almost simultaneously with the new translation of Jordan Stump published by Random House Modern Library (2001).  Kravitz also translatedShipwrecked Family:  Marooned With Uncle Robinson, published by the North American Jules Verne Society and BearManor Fiction in 2011.

The 2003 English edition ofWrecked on a Reef(1869), a memoir by French shipwreck survivorFrançois Édouard Raynal, has additional appendices by French scholar Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal's book on Verne'sThe Mysterious Island. TheGraftonwas wrecked near New Zealand on theAuckland Islandson 3 January 1864, where the crew of five survived for 19 months before obtaining rescue.Wrecked on a Reef, Raynal's memoir of the incident, was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal's account and loosely based his novel on the true life story ofGraftonshipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.

The novel has been translated intoMarathibyB. R. Bhagwattitled 'निर्जन बेटावरचे धाडसी वीर', which roughly translates as "Brave Fighters on a Deserted Island", and has a cult following inMaharashtra. The novel has also been translated toMalayalam, asNigoodadweep, translated by Kesavan Nambisan. There is more than one translation inBengali. The translation by Kuladaranjan Roy is called “আশ্চর্য দ্বীপ” (Aschorjo Dwip) and was republished byKalpabiswa Publicationsin 2023. Another translation by Shamsuddin Nawab fromSheba Prokashoni, published in 1979, is calledRahosshor Dip.

There is also some significance of an adaptation of Captain Nemo and the Mysterious Island in the first arc of the sixth season ofOnce Upon a Time.
