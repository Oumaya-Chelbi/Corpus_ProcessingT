Ivanhoeis the story of one of the remainingAnglo-Saxonnoble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelminglyNorman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for Sir Wilfred's allegiance to the Norman kingRichard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of theThird Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured byLeopold of Austriaon his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.

Protagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, a ward of Cedric and descendant of the Saxon Kings of England. Cedric planned to have Rowena marry the powerful Lord Athelstane, apretenderto the Crown of England by his descent from the last Saxon King,Harold Godwinson. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on theThird Crusade, where he is said to have played a notable role in theSiege of Acre.

The book opens with a scene of Norman knights andprelatesseeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by apilgrim, known at that time as apalmer. That same night, Isaac ofYork, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood on his way to the tournament at Ashby. Following the night's meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, theTemplarBrian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to hisSaracensoldiers to capture Isaac.

The palmer then assists in Isaac's escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of theswineherdGurth.

Isaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and awar horseto participate in thetournamentatAshby-de-la-ZouchCastle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight. The palmer is taken by surprise, but accepts the offer.

The tournament is presided over byPrince John. Also in attendance are Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca,Robin of Locksleyand his men, Prince John's advisor Waldemar Fitzurse, and numerous Normanknights.

On the first day of the tournament, in a bout of individualjousting, a mysterious knight, identifying himself only as "Desdichado" (described in the book as Spanish, taken by the Saxons to mean "Disinherited"), defeats Bois-Guilbert. The masked knight declines to reveal himself despite Prince John's request, but is nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose the Queen of the Tournament. He bestows this honour upon Lady Rowena.

On the second day, at amelee, Desdichado is the leader of one party, opposed by his former adversaries. Desdichado's side is soon hard-pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes until rescued by a knight nicknamedLe Noir Faineant('the Black Sluggard'), who thereafter departs in secret. When forced to unmask himself to receive hiscoronet(the sign of championship), Desdichado is identified as Wilfred of Ivanhoe, returned from the Crusades. This causes much consternation to Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King Richard.

Ivanhoe is severely wounded in the competition yet his father does not move quickly to tend to him. Instead, Rebecca, a skilledphysician, tends to him while they are lodged near the tournament and then convinces her father to take Ivanhoe with them to their home in York when he is fit for that trip. The conclusion of the tournament includes feats of archery by Locksley, such as splitting a willow reed with his arrow. Prince John's dinner for the local Saxons ends in insults.

In the forests between Ashby and York, Isaac, Rebecca and the wounded Ivanhoe are abandoned by their guards, who fear bandits and take all of Isaac's horses. Cedric, Athelstane and the Lady Rowena meet them and agree to travel together. The party is captured by de Bracy and his companions and taken to Torquilstone, the castle of Front-de-Bœuf. The swineherd Gurth and Wamba the jester manage to escape, and then encounter Locksley, who plans a rescue.

The Black Knight, having taken refuge for the night in the hut oflocal friar, the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, volunteers his assistance on learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley. They then besiege the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin's own men, including the friar and assorted Saxonyeomen. Inside Torquilstone, de Bracy expresses his love for the Lady Rowena but is refused. Brian de Bois-Guilbert tries to rape Rebecca and is thwarted. He then tries to seduce her and is rebuffed. Front-de-Bœuf tries to wring a hefty ransom from Isaac of York, but Isaac refuses to pay unless his daughter is freed.

When the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives, their Norman captors demand a priest to administer theFinal Sacramentto Cedric; whereupon Cedric'sjesterWamba slips in disguised as a priest, and takes the place of Cedric, who escapes and brings important information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its layout. On his way out, Cedric meets the Saxon crone Ulrica, who vows revenge on Front-de-Bœuf and advises Cedric to tell the besiegers. The besiegers storm the castle. The castle is set aflame during the assault by Ulrica, the daughter of the original lord of the castle, Lord Torquilstone, as revenge for her father's death. Front-de-Bœuf is killed in the fire while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight, who identifies himself as King Richard and releases de Bracy. Bois-Guilbert escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is captured by the Clerk of Copmanhurst. The Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric, while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is rescued from the burning castle by King Richard. In the fighting, Athelstane is wounded and presumed dead while attempting to rescue Rebecca, whom he mistakes for Rowena.

Following the battle, Locksley plays host to King Richard. Word is conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King's return and the fall of Torquilstone. In the meantime, Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive to the nearest Templar Preceptory, where Lucas de Beaumanoir, theGrand Master of the Templars, takes umbrage at Bois-Guilbert's infatuation and subjects Rebecca to a trial for witchcraft. At Bois-Guilbert's secret request, she claims the right totrial by combat; and Bois-Guilbert, who had hoped to fight as Rebecca's champion, is devastated when the Grand Master orders him to fight on behalf of the Templestowe. Rebecca then writes to her father to procure a champion for her. Cedric organizes Athelstane's funeral atConingsburgh, in the midst of which the Black Knight arrives with Ivanhoe. Cedric, who had not been present at Locksley's carousal, is ill-disposed towards the knight upon learning his true identity, but Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him with his son. During this conversation, Athelstane emerges—not dead, but laid in his coffin alive by monks desirous of the funeral money. Over Cedric's renewed protests, Athelstane pledges his homage to the Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to allow Rowena to marry Ivanhoe, to which Cedric finally agrees.

Soon after this reconciliation, Ivanhoe receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca's behalf. Ivanhoe, riding day and night, arrives in time for the trial by combat; however, both horse and man are exhausted, with little chance of victory. Bois-Guilbert refuses to fight but Ivanhoe accuses him of breaking his word and the Templar reacts fiercely. His face becomes flushed and he is ready for combat. The two knights make one charge at each other with lances, Bois-Guilbert appearing to have the advantage. Ivanhoe and his horse go down, but Bois-Guilbert also falls though barely touched. Ivanhoe quickly gets up to finish the fight with his sword, but Bois-Guilbert does not rise and dies a victim of his own contending passions.

Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together. Fearing further persecution, Rebecca and her father plan to quit England forGranada. Before leaving, Rebecca comes to Rowena shortly after the wedding to bid her a solemn farewell. Ivanhoe's military service ends with the death of King Richard five years later.

Dedicatory Epistle: An imaginary letter to the Rev. Dr Dryasdust from Laurence Templeton who has found the materials for the following tale mostly in the Anglo-Norman Wardour Manuscript. He wishes to provide an English counterpart to the preceding Waverley novels, in spite of various difficulties arising from the chronologically remote setting made necessary by the earlier progress of civilisation south of the Border.

Ch. 1: Historical sketch. Gurth the swineherd and Wamba the jester discuss life under Norman rule.

Ch. 2: Wamba and Gurth wilfully misdirect a group of horsemen headed by Prior Aymer and Brian de Bois-Guilbert seeking shelter at Cedric's Rotherwood. Aymer and Bois-Guilbert discuss the beauty of Cedric's ward Rowena and are redirected, this time correctly, by a palmer [Ivanhoe in disguise].

Critics of the novel have treated it as a romance intended mainly to entertain boys.[7]Ivanhoemaintains many of the elements of theRomance genre, including the quest, a chivalric setting, and the overthrowing of a corrupt social order to bring on a time of happiness.[8]Other critics assert that the novel creates a realistic and vibrant story, idealising neither the past nor its main character.[7][8]

Scott treats themes similar to those of some of his earlier novels, likeRob RoyandThe Heart of Midlothian, examining the conflict between heroic ideals and modern society. In the latter novels, industrial society becomes the centre of this conflict as the "backward" Scots and the "advanced" English have to arise from chaos to create unity. Similarly, the Normans inIvanhoe, who represent a more sophisticated culture, and the Saxons, who are poor, disenfranchised, and resentful of Norman rule, band together and begin to mould themselves into one people. The conflict between the Saxons and Normans focuses on the losses both groups must experience before they can be reconciled and thus forge a united England. The particular loss is in the extremes of their own cultural values, which must be disavowed in order for the society to function. For the Saxons, this value is the final admission of the hopelessness of the Saxon cause. The Normans must learn to overcome the materialism and violence in their own codes ofchivalry. Ivanhoe and Richard represent the hope of reconciliation for a unified future.[7]

Ivanhoe, though of a more noble lineage than some of the other characters, represents a middling individual in the medieval class system who is not exceptionally outstanding in his abilities, as is expected of other quasi-historical fictional characters, such as theGreek heroes. CriticGyörgy Lukácspoints to middling main characters like Ivanhoe in Walter Scott's other novels as one of the primary reasons Scott's historical novels depart from previous historical works, and better explore social and cultural history.[9]

The location of the novel is centred upon southernYorkshire, north-westLeicestershireand northernNottinghamshirein England. Castles mentioned within the story includeAshby de la Zouch Castle(now a ruin in the care ofEnglish Heritage), York (though the mention ofClifford's Tower, likewise an extant English Heritage property, isanachronistic, it not having been called that until later after various rebuilds) and 'Coningsburgh', which is based uponConisbrough Castle, in the ancient town ofConisbroughnearDoncaster(the castle also being a popular English Heritage site). In the novel, Aymer is the Prior of Jorvaulx, a historical spelling of the greatJervaulx AbbeyofYorkshire. Reference is made within the story toYork Minster, where the climactic wedding takes place, and to the Bishop of Sheffield, although theDiocese of Sheffielddid not exist at either the time of the novel or the time Scott wrote the novel and was not founded until 1914. Such references suggest that Robin Hood lived or travelled in the region.

Conisbrough is so dedicated to the story ofIvanhoethat many of its streets, schools, and public buildings are named after characters from the book.

Sir Walter Scott took the title of his novel, the name of its hero, from the Buckinghamshire village ofIvinghoe.
"The name of Ivanhoe," he says in his 1830 Introduction to the Magnum edition, "was suggested by an old rhyme.

Ivanhoe is an alternate name for Ivinghoe first recorded in 1665.[10]

Older rural people in the Ivinghoe area most probably pronounced the name the same as Ivanhoe, according to Prof. Paul Kerswill of the University of York, a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).[11]

It is most probable Scott had direct knowledge of Ivinghoe and did some research before using it as the title for his novel, as he did for the other places mentioned in the novel.

The presence of Sir Walter Scott was recorded in Berkhamsted that is just eight miles away from Ivinghoe.[12]In the novel he speaks also of "the rich fief of Ivanhoe". The Manor of Ivanhoe is listed in the largest 20% of settlements recorded inDomesday.[13]

The modern conception of Robin Hood as a cheerful, decent, patriotic rebel owes much toIvanhoe.

"Locksley" becomes Robin Hood's title in the Scott novel, and it has been used ever since to refer to the legendaryoutlaw. Scott appears to have taken the name from an anonymousmanuscript—written in 1600—that employs "Locksley" as an epithet for Robin Hood. Owing to Scott's decision to make use of the manuscript, Robin Hood from Locksley has been transformed for all time into "Robin of Locksley", alias Robin Hood. (There is, incidentally, a village calledLoxleyin Yorkshire.)

Scott makes the 12th-century's Saxon-Norman conflict a major theme in his novel. The original medieval stories about Robin Hood did not mention any conflict between Saxons and Normans; it was Scott who introduced this theme into the legend.[14]The characters inIvanhoerefer to Prince John and King Richard I as "Normans"; contemporary medieval documents from this period do not refer to either of these two rulers as Normans.[14]Recent re-tellings of the story retain Scott's emphasis on the Norman-Saxon conflict.

Scott also shunned the late-16th-century depiction of Robin as a dispossessed nobleman (the Earl of Huntingdon).

This, however, has not prevented Scott from making an important contribution to the noble-hero strand of the legend, too, because some subsequent motion picture treatments of Robin Hood's adventures give Robin traits that are characteristic of Ivanhoe as well. The most notable Robin Hood films are the lavishDouglas Fairbanks1922 silent film, the 1938 triple Academy Award-winningAdventures of Robin HoodwithErrol Flynnas Robin (which contemporary reviewerFrank Nugentlinks specifically withIvanhoe[15]), and the 1991 box-office successRobin Hood: Prince of ThieveswithKevin Costner. There is also theMel BrooksspoofRobin Hood: Men in Tights.

In most versions of Robin Hood, both Ivanhoe and Robin, for instance, are returning Crusaders. They have quarrelled with their respective fathers, they are proud to be Saxons, they display a highly evolved sense of justice, they support the rightful king even though he is of Norman-French ancestry, they are adept with weapons, and they each fall in love with a "fair maid" (Rowena and Marian, respectively).

This particular time-frame was popularised by Scott. He borrowed it from the writings of the 16th-century chroniclerJohn Mairor a 17th-centuryballadpresumably to make the plot of his novel more gripping. Medieval balladeers had generally placed Robin about two centuries later in the reign ofEdward I,IIorIII.

Robin's familiar feat of splitting his competitor's arrow in an archery contest appears for the first time inIvanhoe.

The general political events depicted in the novel are fairly accurate; the novel tells of the period just after King Richard's imprisonment in Austria following the Crusade and of his return to England after a ransom is paid. Yet the story is also heavily fictionalised. Scott himself acknowledged that he had taken liberties with history in his "Dedicatory Epistle" toIvanhoe. Modern readers are cautioned to understand that Scott's aim was to create a compelling novel set in a historical period, not to provide a book of history.[16]

There has been criticism of Scott's portrayal of the bitter extent of the "enmity of Saxon and Norman, represented as persisting in the days of Richard" as "unsupported by the evidence of contemporary records that forms the basis of the story."[17]HistorianE. A. Freemancriticised Scott's novel, stating its depiction of a Saxon–Norman conflict in late twelfth-century England was unhistorical. Freeman cited medieval writerWalter Map, who claimed that tension between the Saxons and Normans had declined by the reign ofHenry I.[18]Freeman also cited the late twelfth-century bookDialogus de ScaccariobyRichard FitzNeal. This book claimed that the Saxons and Normans had so merged throughintermarriageandcultural assimilationthat (outside the aristocracy) it was impossible to tell "one from the other."[18][19]Finally, Freeman ended his critique of Scott by saying that by the end of the twelfth century, the descendants of both Saxons and Normans in England referred to themselves as "English", not "Saxon" or "Norman".[18][19][20]

However, Scott may have intended to suggest parallels between theNorman Conquest, which takes place roughly 130 years before the setting ofIvanhoe, and Scott's native Scotland, which hadunited with England in 1707roughly the same length of time ago, and witnessed a resurgence inScottish nationalismevidenced by the emergence ofRobert Burns, the famous poet who deliberately chose to work in Scots vernacular though he was an educated man and spoke modern English eloquently.[21]Some experts suggest that Scott deliberately usedIvanhoeto illustrate his own combination of Scottish patriotism andunionism.[22][23]

The novel generated a new name in English—Cedric. The original Saxon name had beenCerdicbut Scott misspelled it—an example ofmetathesis. "It is not a name but a misspelling" said satiristH. H. Munro.[citation needed]

In England in 1194, it would have been anachronistic for Rebecca, a Jewish woman, to be charged withwitchcraft. In medieval witch trials, it was usually the belief in witchcraft that was prosecuted as a heresy, a charge a non-Christian woman would not have been subject to. Death did not become the usual penalty until the 15th century and even then, the form of execution used for witches in England was hanging, notburning. The conductor of the trial, the Grand Master Of The Templars, is referred to as Lucas de Beaumanoir, whereas the historically real Master during that time wasGilbert Horal. There are other various minor errors, e.g. the description of the tournament at Ashby owes more to the 14th century, most of the coins mentioned by Scott are exotic,William Rufusis said to have been John Lackland's grandfather, but he was actually his great-great-uncle, and Wamba (disguised as a monk) says "I am a poor brother of the Order of St Francis", butSt. Francis of Assisionly began his preaching ten years after the death of Richard I. Also, in Chapter 43, Bois-Guilbert commences the fight being mounted on his horse named Zamor, which he claimed that he had won from the "Soldan of Trebizond". This is anachronistic, as the Comnenids founded the rumpByzantineEmpire of Trebizondonly in 1204, just by the end of theFourth Crusade. Lastly, in the novel's ultimate chapter, Rebecca and her father move to Granada to spend the rest of their lives under Mohammed Boabdil. In fact, the realMuhammad XII of Granada, popularly known to the Western world as Boabdil, was not even born before 1460, and theEmirate of Granadaestablished before 1230.

Despite this fancifulness,Ivanhoedoes make some prescient historical points. The novel is occasionally critical of King Richard, "who seems to love adventure more than he loves the well-being of his subjects"—in contrast to the idealised, romantic view of Richard popular at the time, but rather echoes the way King Richard is often judged by historians today.[24]

Most of the original reviewers gaveIvanhoean enthusiastic or broadly favourable reception.[25]As usual, Scott's descriptive powers and his ability to present the matters of the past were generally praised. More than one reviewer found the work notably poetic. Several of them found themselves transported imaginatively to the remote period of the novel, although some problems were recognised: the combining of features from the high and late Middle Ages; an awkwardly created language for the dialogue; and antiquarian overload. The author's excursion into England was generally judged a success, the forest outlaws and the creation of 'merry England' attracting particular praise. Rebecca was almost unanimously admired, especially in her farewell scene. The plot was either criticised for its weakness, or just regarded as of less importance than the scenes and characters. The scenes at Torquilstone were judged horrible by several critics, with special focus on Ulrica. Athelstane's resurrection found no favour, the kindest response being that of Francis Jeffrey inThe Edinburgh Reviewwho suggested (writing anonymously, like all the reviewers) that it was 'introduced out of the very wantonness of merriment'.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon, who was a devotee of Scott's, wrote a poetical illustration to a picture ofThe Tournament. byThomas Allomin Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838.[26]

TheEglinton Tournament of 1839held bythe 13th Earl of EglintonatEglinton Castlein Ayrshire was inspired by and modelled onIvanhoe.

On 5 November 2019,BBC NewsincludedIvanhoeon its list of the100 most influential novels.[27]

The novel has been the basis for several motion pictures:

There have also been many television adaptations of the novel, including:

Victor Sieg's dramaticcantataIvanhoéwon thePrix de Romein 1864 and premiered in Paris the same year.Ivanhoewas thegrand operabyArthur SullivanandJulian Sturgis(Sturgis was recommended by Sullivan's oft-time partnerW. S. Gilbert). It debuted in 1891, and ran for 155 consecutive performances.[33]Other operas based on the novel have been composed byGioachino Rossini(Ivanhoé),Thomas Sari(Ivanhoé),Bartolomeo Pisani(Rebecca),A. Castagnier(Rébecca),Otto Nicolai(Il Templario), andHeinrich Marschner(Der Templer und die Jüdin). Rossini's opera is apasticcio(an opera in which the music for a new text is chosen from pre-existent music by one or more composers). Scott attended a performance of it and recorded inhis journal, "It was an opera, and, of course, the story sadly mangled and the dialogue, in part nonsense."[34]

The railway running throughAshby-de-la-Zouchwas known as theIvanhoe linebetween 1993 and 2005, in reference to the book's setting in the locality.

A portion of theSilver Lakeneighborhood in Los Angeles was established in 1887 as a real estate tract called Ivanhoe. (Realtors John C. Byram and Robert W. Poindexter were behind the tract; it is a myth that it was named decades earlier by Scottish settler Hugo Reid, as he never lived in this section of Los Angeles County.) The upper reservoir and an elementary school are still named Ivanhoe while many of the streets in the area reference Scott's other works and characters such as Locksley, Rowena, Kenilworth, Waverly [sic], Avenel, and St. George.[35]

Ivanhoe, North Carolinais named afterIvanhoe.[36]
