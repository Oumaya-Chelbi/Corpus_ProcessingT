In 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterioussea monster, which is speculated to be a giganticnarwhal. The U.S. government assembles an expedition inNew York Cityto find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a Frenchmarine biologistand the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition.Canadianwhalerand masterharpoonerNed Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.

The expedition leaves Brooklyn aboard theUnited States NavyfrigateAbraham Lincoln, then travels south aroundCape Horninto thePacific Ocean. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. Aronnax and Land are hurled into the sea, and Conseil jumps into the water after them. They survive by climbing onto the "monster", which, they are startled to find, is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they are captured and introduced to the submarine's mysterious constructor and commander,Captain Nemo.

The rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard theNautilus, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation — a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to escape terrestrialcivilization. Nemo explains that his submarine iselectrically poweredand can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he cannot let them leave — they must remain on board permanently.

They visit many oceanic regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers viewcoralformations, sunken vessels from theBattle of Vigo Bay, theAntarcticice barrier, thetransatlantic telegraph cable, and the legendary underwater realm ofAtlantis. They even travel to the South Pole and are trapped in an upheaval of an iceberg on the way back, caught in a narrow gallery of ice from which they are forced to dig themselves out. The passengers also put ondiving suits, huntsharksand other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by theNautilus. When the submarine returns to theAtlantic Ocean, a school ofgiant squid("devilfish") attacks the vessel and kills another crewman.

The novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, theNautilusis attacked by awarshipfrom the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo — whom Aronnax dubs an "archangel of hatred" — rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression.

Circumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, he announces that they are in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him, yet he is still drawn to the man. Fearing that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, he avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, "O almighty God! Enough! Enough!". Aronnax immediately joins his companions as they carry out their escape plans, but as they board the submarine's skiff they realize that theNautilushas seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, theMoskenstraumen(more commonly known as the "Maelstrom"). They escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate remained unknown until the events ofThe Mysterious Island.

Captain Nemo's assumed name recallsHomer'sOdyssey, whenOdysseusencounters the monstrousCyclopsPolyphemusin the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it isOutis(Οὖτις) 'no one', translated intoLatinas "Nemo". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for ten years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.

The novel repeatedly mentions the U.S. Naval CommanderMatthew Fontaine Maury, an oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.

The novel alludes to other Frenchmen, includingLapérouse, the celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation;Dumont d'Urville, a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lapérouse's ships; andFerdinand de Lesseps, builder of theSuez Canaland nephew of the sole survivor of Lapérouse's ill-fated expedition. TheNautilusfollows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lapérouse's vessels disappeared; she entersTorres Straitand becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, theAstrolabe; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

In possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-described battle with a school ofgiant squid, one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: "To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author ofThe Toilers of the Sea." A bestselling novel in Verne's day,The Toilers of the Seaalso features a threateningcephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by critics to be symbolic of theIndustrial Revolution. Certainly, Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in theRevolutions of 1848.

Other symbols and themes pique modern critics.Margaret Drabble, for instance, argues that Verne's masterwork also anticipated theecology movementand influenced Frenchavant-gardeimagery.[8]As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during theCretan Revolt of 1866–1869, proving to Professor Aronnax that he had not severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues anIndianpearl diverfrom a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. When asked why he would help a "representative of that race from which he'd fled under the seas", Nemo responds that the diver, as an "East Indian", "lives in the land of the oppressed".[9]

Indeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the book's final form, Nemo says to professor Aronnax, "That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!"[10]In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was aPolish nobleman, whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the PolishJanuary Uprisingof 1863. These specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisherPierre-Jules Hetzel, believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of theRussian Empire, hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy war, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins.

Even so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under a Polish hero,Tadeusz Kościuszko, leader of theuprising against Russian and Prussian control in 1794;[11]Kościuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation "Finis Poloniae!" ("Polandis no more!").

Five years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel,The Mysterious Island. The novel changes the captain's nationality from Polish to Indian; in the book's final chapters, Nemo reveals that he is an Indian prince named Dakkar who was a descendant ofTipu Sultan, a prominent ruler of theKingdom of Mysore, and participated in theIndian Rebellion of 1857, an ultimately unsuccessful uprising againstCompany rule in India. After the rebellion, which led to the death of his family, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages.

Verne took the name "Nautilus" from one of theearliest successful submarines, built in 1800 byRobert Fulton, who also invented the first commercially successfulsteamboat. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chamberednautilus. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developedFrench NavysubmarinePlongeurat the 1867Exposition Universelle, which guided him in his development of the novel'sNautilus.[4]

The diving gear used by passengers on theNautilusis presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) thesurface-supplied[12]hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatusdesigned by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865. Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demandregulator.[12][13][14]The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called anaérophore(Greek for "air-carrier"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, but Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: "TheNautilus's pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours."

The novel was first translated into English in 1872 by ReverendLewis Page Mercier. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the Frenchscaphandre— properly "diving suit" — as "cork-jacket", following a long-obsolete usage as "a type oflifejacket"). Some of these distortions may have been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally includingDaniel O'Connell[15]among other international figures. Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later retranslations continued to recycle its mistakes, including mistranslating the title as "...under the Sea", rather than "...under the Seas".

In 1962, Anthony Bonner published a translation of the novel withBantam Classics. This edition included an introduction byRay Bradbury, comparing Captain Nemo toCaptain AhabofMoby-Dick.[16]

A significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.[17]Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text. In 1976, Miller published "The Annotated Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"[18]at the suggestion of theThomas Y. Crowel Companyeditorial staff.[19]The cover declared it "The only completely restored and annotated edition". In 1993, Miller collaborated with his fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter to produce "The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition", published in 1993 by theNaval Institute Press.[20]Its text took advantage of Walter's unpublished translation, whichProject Gutenberglater made available online.

In 1998, William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, published byOxford University Press(ISBN978-0-19-953927-7). Butcher includes detailed notes, a comprehensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by Hetzel, his publisher.

In 2010, Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation,20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations titledAmazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classicsand published byState University of New York Press(ISBN978-1-4384-3238-0).

In 2017, David Coward issued a new translation published byPenguin Classics(ISBN9780141394930) with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, including a new introduction, notes, and a note on the text, using the 1871 Christian Chelebourg edition of the text as the basis for his translation. Coward also included 42 illustrations, which were published for the first time in the 'Collection Hetzel' in 1901.

The science fiction writerTheodore L. Thomascriticized the novel in 1961, claiming that "there is not a single bit of valid speculation" in the book and that "none of its predictions has come true". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and theNautilusas "pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time." The notes to the 1993 translation point out that the errors Thomas notes were in Mercier's translation, not the original.

Despite his criticisms, Thomas conceded: "Put them all together with the magic of Verne's story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it".[13]

In 2023, Malaurie Guillaume presented Nemo as the firsteco-terroristor first figure of ecologic radicality.[21]
