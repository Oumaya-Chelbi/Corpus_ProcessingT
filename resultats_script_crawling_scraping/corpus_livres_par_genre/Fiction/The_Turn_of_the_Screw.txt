OnChristmas Eve, an unnamed narrator and some of his friends are gathered around a fire. One of them, Douglas, reads a manuscript written by his sister's late governess. The manuscript tells the story of her being hired by a man who has become responsible for his young niece and nephew following the deaths of their parents. He lives mainly in London and has a country house in Bly,Essex.

The boy, Miles, is attending a boarding school, while his younger sister, Flora, is living in Bly, where she is cared for by Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper. Flora's uncle, the governess's new employer, is uninterested in raising the children and gives her full charge, explicitly stating that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort.  The governess travels to Bly and begins her duties.

Miles returns from school for the summer just after a letter arrives from the headmaster, informing his caretakers that he has been expelled. Miles never speaks of the matter, and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue. She fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion, but is too charmed by the boy to want to press the issue.

Soon after, around the grounds of the estate, the governess begins to see the figures of a man and woman whom she does not recognize. The figures come and go at will without being seen or challenged by other members of the household, and they seem to the governess to be supernatural. She learns from Mrs. Grose that the governess's predecessor, Miss Jessel, and another employee, Peter Quint, had had a close relationship. Before their deaths, Jessel and Quint spent much of their time with Flora and Miles, and the governess becomes convinced that the two children are aware of the ghosts' presence and influenced by them.

Without permission, Flora leaves the house while Miles is playing music for the governess. The governess notices Flora's absence and goes with Mrs. Grose in search of her. They find her on the shore of a nearby lake, and the governess is convinced that Flora has been talking to the ghost of Miss Jessel. The governess sees Miss Jessel and believes Flora sees her as well, but Mrs. Grose does not. Flora denies seeing Miss Jessel and begins to insist that she will not see the new governess again.

The governess decides that Mrs. Grose should take Flora away to her uncle in attempt to escape Miss Jessel's influence. Left alone with the governess, Miles at last confesses he was expelled for something he said but cannot remember what he said or to whom he said it. The ghost of Quint appears to the governess at the window. The governess shields Miles, who attempts to see the ghost. The governess insists to Miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost, only to find that Miles has died in her arms.

As a piece of Gothic fiction, critics highlight the influence ofCharlotte Brontë'sJane Eyre(1847) on the novella.The Turn of the Screwborrows both fromJane Eyre's themes ofclassand gender,[1]and from its mid-nineteenth-century setting.[2]The novella alludes toJane Eyrein tandem with an explicit reference toAnn Radcliffe's Gothic novelThe Mysteries of Udolpho(1794), wherein the governess wonders if there might be a secret relative hidden in the attic at Bly.[3]One critic writes that the only "definite event" in the novel that does not "belong" in Gothic fantasy is Miles' expulsion from school.[4]

Although the influence of the Gothic on the novella is clear, it cannot only be characterised as one. James' ghosts differ from those of traditional Gothic tales – frightening, often bound in chains – by appearing like their living selves.[5]Similarly, the novella foregoes major devices associated with Gothic novels, such as digressions, as inFrankenstein(1818) andDracula(1897), instead relating one whole, continuous narrative.[6]

For the story's publication inCollier's Weekly, James was contracted to write a ghost story.[7]As a result, some critics have regarded it in that tradition. L. Andrew Cooper observed thatThe Turn of the Screwmight be the best-known example of a ghost story which exploits the ambiguity of afirst-person narrative.[8]Citing James' reference to the work as his "designed horror", Donald P. Costello suggested that the effect of a given scene varies depending on who represents the action. In scenes where the governess directly reports on what she sees, the effect is horror, but in those where she merely comments, the effect is "mystification".[9]In his 1983 nonfiction survey of the horror genre, authorStephen KingdescribedThe Turn of the ScrewandThe Haunting of Hill House(1959) as the only two great supernatural works of horror in a century. He argued that both contain "secrets best left untold and things left best unsaid", calling that the basis of the horror genre.[10]Gillian Flynncalled the novella one of the most chilling ghost stories ever written.[11]

Several biographers have indicated that James was familiar withspiritualism, and at the very least regarded it as entertainment. His brotherWilliamwas an active researcher of supernatural phenomena.[12]Scientific inquiry at the time was curious about the existence of ghosts, and James' description of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel—dressed in black with severe expressions—resemble the ghosts found in scientific literature rather than those of fictional narratives.[13]The character of Douglas describes himself as a student ofTrinity College, where James knew research into the supernatural occurred. It is unknown whether James believed in ghosts.[14][a]

By the 1890s, James' readership had dwindled since the success ofDaisy Miller(1878), and he had encountered financial troubles. His health had also worsened, with advancinggout,[15]and several of his close friends had died: his sister and diaristAlice James, and writersRobert Louis StevensonandConstance Fenimore Woolson.[16]In a letter from October 1895, James wrote: "I see ghosts everywhere".[17]In an entry in his journal from January 12, 1895, James recounts a ghost story told to him byEdward White Benson, the archbishop of Canterbury, while visiting him for tea at his home two days earlier. The story bears a striking resemblance to what would eventually becomeThe Turn of the Screw, with depraved servants corrupting young children before and after their deaths.[18]

Towards the end of 1897, James was contracted to write a twelve-part ghost story forCollier's Weekly, an illustrated magazine. Having just signed a twenty-one year lease on a house in Rye, East Sussex, James —thankful for the additional income—accepted the offer.[19][20]Collier's Weeklypaid James US$900 (equivalent to US$34,000 in 2024) for the serial rights.[21]A year earlier, in 1897,The Chap-Bookpaid him US$150 (equivalent to US$5,700 in 2024) for serial and book rights toWhat Maisie Knew.[22]

James found it difficult to write by hand,[23]reserving that for his journals.The Turn of the Screwwas dictated to his secretary, William MacAlpine, who took shorthand notes and returned with typed notes the following day. Finding such a delay frustrating, James purchased his ownRemingtontypewriter and dictated directly to MacAlpine.[24][25]In December 1897, James wrote to his sister-in-law: "Ihave, at last, finished my little book."[26]

The Turn of the Screwwas first published in the magazineCollier's Weekly, serialised in 12 installments (27 January – 16 April 1898). The title illustration byJohn La Fargedepicts the governess with her arm around Miles. Episode illustrations were byEric Pape.[27]

In October 1898, the novella appeared with the short story "Covering End" in a volume titledThe Two Magics, published byMacmillanin New York City and byHeinemannin London.[28]

Ten years after publication, James revisedThe Turn of the Screwfor theNew York Editionof the text.[29]James made many changes, but most were minor, such as changing "utter" to "express"; the narrative was unchanged. TheNew York Edition's most important contribution was the retrospective account of the influences and writing of the novella James gave in his preface. James indicated, for example, that he was aware of research into the supernatural.[30]In his preface, James only briefly mentions the story's origin in a magazine. In 2016, Kirsten MacLeod, citing James' private correspondence, indicated that he had a strong dislike for the serial form.[31]

Early reviews emphasised the novella's power to frighten, and most saw the tale as a brilliant, if simple, ghost story.[33]According to scholar Terry Heller, most early reviewers saw the novel as a formidable piece of Gothic fiction.[34]

An early review ofThe Turn of the Screwwas inThe New York Times Saturday Review of Books and Art, stating it was worthy of being compared to Robert Louis Stevenson'sStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886). The reviewer noted it as a successful study of evil, referring to the ghosts' influence over the children and the governess.[35]Scholar Terry Heller notes that the children featured prominently in early criticism because the novella violated a Victorian presumption of childhood innocence.[36]

Conceptions of the text wherein the ghosts are real entities are often referred to as the "apparitionist interpretation";[37]consequently, a "non-apparitionist" holds the opposite perspective.[38]In a 1918 essay,Virginia Woolfwrote that Miss Jessel and Peter Quint possessed "neither the substance nor independent existence of ghosts".[39]Woolf did not suggest that the ghosts were hallucinations, but—in a similar fashion to other early critics—said they represented the governess' growing awareness of evil in the world. The power of the story, she argued, was in forcing readers to realise the dark places fiction could take their minds.[40]

In 1934, literary criticEdmund Wilsonposited that the ghosts were hallucinations of the governess, who he suggested was sexually repressed. As evidence, Wilson points to her background as the daughter of a country parson, and suggests that she is infatuated with her employer.[41]Before Wilson's article, another critic—Edna Kenton—had written to similar effect, but Wilson's fame as a literary critic shifted the discourse around the novella completely.[42][43][c]Wilson drew heavily from Kenton's writing, but applied explicitlyFreudianterminology.[44]For example, he pointed to Quint first being sighted by the governess on a phallic tower.[45]A book-lengthclose readingof the text was produced in 1965 using Wilson's Freudian analysis as a foundation; it characterised the governess as increasingly mad and hysterical.[46]Leon Edel, James' most influential biographer, wrote that it is not the ghosts who haunt the children, but the governess.[47]

While many supported Wilson's theory, it was by no means authoritative.[48]Robert B. Heilmanwas a prominent advocate for the apparitionist interpretation; he saw the story as aHawthornesqueallegory about good and evil, and the ghosts as active agents to that effect.[49]Scholars critical of Wilson's essay pointed to Douglas' positive account of the governess's character in the prologue, long after her death. Most crucially, they indicated that the governess's description of the ghost enabled Mrs Grose to identify him as Peter Quint before the governess knew he existed.[49]The second point led Wilson to "retract his thesis (temporarily)";[48]in a later revision of his essay, he argued the governess had been made aware of another male at Bly by Mrs Grose.[50][d]

In the 1970s, critics began to applystructuralistTzvetan Todorov's notion of thefantastictoThe Turn of the Screw.[51][52]Todorov emphasised the importance of "hesitation" in stories with supernatural elements, and critics found an abundance of them within James' novella. For example, the reader's sympathy may hesitate between the children or the governess,[53]and the text hesitates between supporting the ghosts' existence, and rejecting them.[54]Christine Brooke-Roseargued in a three-part essay that the ambiguity so frequently argued over was a foundational part of the text that had been ignored.[55]From the 1980s onwards, critics increasingly refused to ask questions aboutdiegeticelements of the text, instead acknowledging that many elements simply cannot be known definitively.[56]

Focus shifted away from whether the ghosts were real and onto how James generated and then sustained the text's ambiguity. A study into revisions James made to two paragraphs in the novella concluded that James was not striving for clarity, but to create a text which could not be interpreted definitively in either direction.[57]

This is still a position held by many critics, such asGiovanni Bottiroli[it], who argues that evidence for the intended ambiguity of the text can be found at the beginning of the novella, where Douglas tells his fictional audience that the governess had never told anyone but himself about the events that happened at Bly, and that they "would easily judge" why. Bottiroli believes that this address to Douglas' fictional audience is also meant as an address to the reader, telling them that they will "easily judge" whether or not the ghosts are real.[58]

After the debate over the reality of the ghosts quieted in literary criticism, critics began to apply other theoretical frameworks toThe Turn of the Screw.Marxistcritics argued that the emphasis placed by academics on James' language distracted fromclass-based explorations of the text.[59]The children's uncle, who featured largely only in the psychoanalytic interpretations as an obsession of the governess, was regarded by some as symbolising a selfishupper-class. Heath Moon notes how he abandoned his orphaned niece, nephew, and their ancestral home to instead live in London as a bachelor.[60]Mrs Grose's distaste for the relationship between Quint and Miss Jessel was noted to be part of aVictoriandislike for relationships that were between different social classes.[61]The death of Miles and Flora's parents in India became a fixture ofpostcolonialexplorations of the text, given the status of India as aBritish colonyduring James' lifetime.[62]

Explorations of the governess have become a mainstay offeministwriting on the text. Priscilla Walton noted that James' account of the story's origin disparaged the ability of women to tell stories, and framedThe Turn of the Screwas James thus telling it on their behalf.[63]Others see James in a more positive light. Paula Marantz Cohen positively compares James' treatment of the governess to Sigmund Freud's writing about a young woman namedDora. Cohen likens the way that Freud transforms Dora into merely a summary of her symptoms to how critics such as Edmund Wilson reduced the governess to a case of neurotic sexual repression.[64]

The Turn of the Screwhas been the subject of a range of adaptations and reworkings in a variety of media. Many of these have, themselves, been analysed in the academic literature on Henry James andneo-Victorianculture.[65]

The novella was adapted toan operabyBenjamin Britten, which premiered in 1954,[65]and the opera has been filmed on multiple occasions.[66]The novella was adapted as a ballet score (1980) byLuigi Zaninelli,[67]and separately as a ballet (1999) by Will Tucket for theRoyal Ballet.[68]Harold PinterdirectedThe Innocents(1950), a Broadway play which was an adaptation ofThe Turn of the Screw.[69]An adaptation byJeffrey Hatcher, using the titleThe Turn of the Screw, premiered in Portland, Maine, in 1996 and was producedoff-Broadwayin 1999.[70]Another adaptation of the same title byRebecca Lenkiewiczwas presented in a co-production withHammerat theAlmeida Theatre, London, in January 2013.[71]

There have been numerous film adaptations of the novel.[67]The critically acclaimedThe Innocents(1961), directed byJack Clayton, andMichael Winner's prequelThe Nightcomers(1972) are two notable examples.[65]Other feature film adaptations includeRusty Lemorande's 1992 eponymous adaptation (set in the 1960s);[72]Eloy de la Iglesia'sSpanishlanguageOtra vuelta de tuerca(The Turn of the Screw, 1985);[67]Presence of Mind(1999), directed by Atoni Aloy; andIn a Dark Place(2006), directed by Donato Rotunno.[66]The Others(2001) is not an adaptation but has some themes in common with James's novella.[66][73]In 2018, directorFloria Sigismondifilmed an adaptation of the novella, titledThe Turning, on theKilruddery Estatein Ireland.[74]

Television films have included a 1959 American adaptation as part ofFord Startimedirected byJohn Frankenheimerand starringIngrid Bergman;[66][75]the West GermanDie sündigen Engel(The Sinful Angel, 1962),[76]a1974 adaptationdirected byDan Curtis, adapted byWilliam F.

The Turn of the Screwhas also influenced television.[85]In December 1968, the ABC daytime dramaDark Shadowsfeatured a storyline based onThe Turn of the Screw. In the story, the ghosts ofQuentin Collinsand Beth Chavez haunted the west wing of Collinwood, possessing the two children living in the mansion. The story led to a year-long story in the year 1897, as Barnabas Collins travelled back in time to prevent Quentin's death and stop the possession.[85]In early episodes ofStar Trek: Voyager("Cathexis", "Learning Curve" and "Persistence of Vision"),Captain Kathryn Janewayis seen on theholodeckacting out scenes from theholonovelJaneway Lambda one, which appears to be based onThe Turn of the Screw.[86]The novel was adapted as a Mexican miniseries entitledOtra vuelta de tuerca(The Turn of the Screw) in 1981,[76]and in 2020,Netflixadapted the novella asThe Haunting of Bly Manorfor the second season ofMike Flanagan'sThe Hauntinganthology series.[87][88]
