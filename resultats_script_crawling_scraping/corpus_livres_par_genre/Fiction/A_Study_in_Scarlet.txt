In 1881,Doctor John Watsonreturns toLondonafter serving in theSecond Anglo-Afghan Warand starts looking for a place to live. An old friend of his named Stamford tells him thatSherlock Holmesis looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at221B Baker Streetbut cautions Watson about Holmes's eccentricities. Holmes and Watson meet and, after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes is a "consulting detective", and his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes'sdeductiveskills, Watson's disbelief turns into astonishment.

Atelegramrequests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to thecrime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson andLestradeare already on the scene. The victim is Enoch Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is "RACHE" (German for "revenge"), which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber's body, they discover a woman's gold wedding ring.

Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys afacsimileof it, hoping to draw the murderer – who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring – out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise.

A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He went to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson stayed before the murder. Drebber, a drunk, attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. He, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with acudgelbut claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.

Stangerson is later murdered. His body is found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written "RACHE". The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying "J.H. is in Europe", and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sicklyScottish Terrierin residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier.

A young street urchin named Wiggins then arrives. He is the leader of theBaker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins has summoned a cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. The captive cabby is Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

In Utah'sSalt Lake Valleyin 1847, John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party ofpioneers, are rescued from death by a party ofLatter-day Saintsled byBrigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later in 1860, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church's Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn never to marry his daughter to a Mormon, sends word to Hope.

Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope arrives on the eve of the last day, and they all escape under cover of darkness.  The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed by Stangerson while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies less than a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson but begins to suffer from anaortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. After returning years later, he learns Drebber and Stangerson have fledSalt Lake Cityafter a schism between the Mormons. Drebber is now wealthy from Lucy's estate and Stangerson has become his secretary. For over 20 years Hope pursues them; in Cleveland, Ohio, Hope recognizes Drebber who has Hope imprisoned for a few months as a "rival in love". After being released, Hope tracks them to Europe through France, Russia, Denmark and to England.

In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier's son, Drebber gets into Hope's cab and spends hours drinking. Hope then takes him to the house on Brixton Road and forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write "RACHE" on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills. However, Stangerson attacks him and Hope stabs him in the heart.

Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he deduced the murderer's identity. In the newspapers, Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

Arthur Conan Doylewrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks.[4]As a doctor in general practice inSouthsea,Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodicalLondon Society. The story was originally titledA Tangled Skeinand was eventually published byWard, Lock & Co. in the 1887 edition ofBeeton's Christmas Annual, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed forroyaltybut instead received £25 in return for the full rights (equivalent to £3,371.95 considering inflation). It was illustrated byDavid Henry Friston.

The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock & Co, and featured drawings by the author's father,Charles Doyle. In 1890,J. B. Lippincott & Co.released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock & Bowden Limited (formerly Ward, Lock & Co.) was illustrated byGeorge Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt.[5]Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.

According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter-day Saints' organisation as being steeped inkidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: "all I said about theDaniteBand and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It's best to let the matter rest."[6]Conan Doyle's daughter has stated: "You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons."[6]Historians speculate that "Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books byFannie Stenhouse,William A. Hickman, William Jarman,John HydeandAnn Eliza Young, among others",[6]in explaining the author's early perspective on Mormonism.

Years after Conan Doyle's death,Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that the author had privately apologised, saying that "He [Conan Doyle] said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church"[6]and had "written a scurrilous book about the Mormons."[7]

In August 2011, theAlbemarle County, Virginia, school board removedA Study in Scarletfrom the district's sixth-grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons.[8][9]It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth-graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.[10]

As the first Sherlock Holmes story published,A Study in Scarletwas among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a Britishsilent filmbe produced byG. B. Samuelson. In the film, titledA Study in Scarlet, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story.[11]As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now alost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 filmThe Valley of Fear.[12]

A two-reel short film, also titledA Study in Scarlet, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starredFrancis Fordas Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.[12]

The 1933 film titledA Study in Scarlet, starringReginald Owenas Holmes andAnna May Wongas Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel.[13]Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names (Jabez Wilson, etc.).[13]The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later inAgatha Christie's novelAnd Then There Were None.[14]

Edith MeiseradaptedA Study in Scarletinto a four-part serial for the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, withRichard Gordonas Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.[15]

In 2023, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the beginning of the story in its first episode, "Mr Sherlock Holmes", but only alloded to the mystery itself at the very end and in the following episode. It starred Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

The1954–1955 television series(withRonald Howardas Holmes andH. Marion Crawfordas Watson) used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode "The Case of the Cunningham Heritage".[22]

The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television seriesSherlock Holmes,[23]withPeter Cushingin the lead role andNigel Stockas Dr Watson.

It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979Soviettelevision film,Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson(the first episode combines the story of their meeting with "The Adventure of the Speckled Band"; the second episode adapts the actual Jefferson Hope case).[24]

A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, withPeter O'Toolevoicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O'Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time.

A Study in Scarletis one of several stories not adapted forthe television seriesstarringJeremy Brettbetween 1984 and 1994.

Steven Moffatloosely adaptedA Study in Scarletinto "A Study in Pink" as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television seriesSherlockfeaturingBenedict Cumberbatchas a 21st-century Sherlock Holmes, andMartin Freemanas Dr Watson.[25]The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled "RACHE" and the two pills, and the killer's potentially fatalaneurysm(although it is located in his brain rather than his aorta). However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also featuresMoriarty's presence. The first meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted again in the Victorian setting in the special "The Abominable Bride".

"The Deductionist", an episode ofElementary, contains many elements of Hope's case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, "A Study in Charlotte".

"The First Adventure", the first episode of the 2014NHKpuppetry seriesSherlock Holmes, is loosely based onA Study in Scarletand "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons". In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school calledBeeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. "Scarlet Story", the series' opening theme tune, is named after the novel.[26]The name of "Beeton School" is partially inspired byBeeton's Christmas Annual.[27]

A Study in Scarletwas illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz forClassics Illustratedcomics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form byInnovation Publishingin 1969 by James Stenstrum and illustrated by Noly Panaligan, bySterling Publishingin 2010 byIan Edgintonand illustrated byI. N. J.

In hisNaked Is the Best Disguise(1974),Samuel Rosenbergnotes the similarity between Jefferson Hope's tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence inJames Joyce's novelUlysses, though of course Joyce's work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg's book.

The British fantasy and comic book writerNeil Gaimanadapted this story to the universe of horror writerH. P. Lovecraft'sCthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled "A Study in Emerald" (2004) and is modelled with a parallel structure.

InGarage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders(2016), the second murder is an imitation of this murder.

InThe Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve, a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life.
