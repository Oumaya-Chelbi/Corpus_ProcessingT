Marcus Yallow is a 17-year-oldhacker/techno whiz fromSan Francisco. One day Marcus and his best friend Darryl play truant from school to play anAlternate Reality Game. A terrorist attack is perpetrated against the city, and the four are captured and detained under suspicion of terrorism.

After a series of interrogations that take place over a period of six days, Marcus, Jolu, and Vanessa are finally released; Darryl's whereabouts are unknown. The DHS tells Marcus that they will be monitoring his actions and moves because he is still a suspect. Marcus is "infuriated at how his civil rights [are] ignored."[12]

In response to the increasing surveillance of the city and its citizens, Marcus creates Xnet, a privatemesh networkintended to allow people to communicate freely while fighting "the surveillance state."[13]Through XNet, using his pseudonym 'Mik3y', Marcus encourages his peers to rebel against the DHS surveillance.

While introducing a group to cryptography during akey signing party, Marcus meets Ange, and shortly thereafter they begin to date.

When a former prisoner who was held by the DHS tells Marcus that Darryl is still alive, Marcus tells a reporter and his family about his actions taken against the DHS. The journalist's story is then published and the DHS takes Marcus into custody again. On order from the governor, California Highway Patrol troopers raid the DHS compound during a waterboarding interrogation and arrest the DHS agents. Darryl is subsequently freed and Marcus, after his parents have to pay his bail to make sure he does not go to prison, finally returns to his life the way it was before the terrorist attacks.

Little Brotherhas major themes that, according to some, are too serious for ayoung adultnovel. In an interview, theJournal of Adolescent & Adult Literacyasked Doctorow about his "potentially heavy themes, including paranoia, loyalty, sex, torture, [and] fear"[14]and when his editing staff asked to censor the themes, he replied, "Oh, no."

The Hollywood Reporterremarked, "The book tackles many themes, including civil liberties and social activism".[15]

According to journalist April Spisak's article on "What Makes a Good Young Adult Dystopian Novel?" Spisak claims, "Cory Doctorow's Little Brother probably represents the purest example on the list—modern technology meets classic dystopic elements—even while the book itself is part instructional guide, part love story, and part rant at the increasingly dictatorial powers-that-be that consider safety at any cost a reasonable exchange. Small personal victories for the protagonist and his friends are present, but the power of Big Brother is hardly tempered by their work, and the folks who tangled with the government are all permanently scarred by the encounter."[16]

The book has also been characterized as "[expressing] astonishment, fear, uncertainty, shame, and guilt"[17]and addressing "issues of political authority, social order, individual freedom and electronic security."[18]

Little Brothertakes place in the "near future rather than decades or centuries away."[19]Little Brotheralso makes use of "obvious parallels toOrwellianwarnings and post9/11policies."[20]

Cindy Dobrez in her review forBooklistsaid that "Doctorow's novel blurs the lines between current and potential technologies, and readers will delight in the details of how Marcus attempts to stage a techno-revolution. Obvious parallels to Orwellian warnings and post-9/11policies, such as thePatriot Act, will provide opportunity for classroom discussion and raise questions about our enthusiasm for technology, who monitors our school library collections, and how we contribute to our own lack of privacy."[20]Kirkus Reviewsdescribed it as an "unapologetically didactic tribute to1984", and called it a "Terrifying glimpse of the future—or the present."[21]Publishers Weeklysaid that it was "filled with sharp dialogue and detailed descriptions of how to counteractgait-recognition cameras, RFID's (radio frequency IDtags), wireless Internet tracers and other surveillance devices, this work makes its admittedly didactic point within a tautly crafted fictional framework."[22]TheInstitute of Public Affairs, a thinktank, says that "Doctorow, like many freedom-fighting writers before him likes his women smart and strong. Male or female, freedom-loving writers tend to like writing strong female characters, often protagonists."[23]

In 2014, a high school principal inPensacola, Florida, Michael Roberts, pulledLittle Brotherfrom his school's summer reading list because the book is "about questioning authority" and portrays questioning authority "as a positive thing."; however it was kept on the list for advanced placement and grade 11 honors students. Roberts also described Cory Doctorow, a Canadian author living in England, as "an outsider to theGeorge W. Bushadministration."[24]In response, his publisher sent 200 copies of the book directly to the school.[25]

In early 2012, it was announced that the novelLittle Brotherwritten by Cory Doctorow will be made into a play directed by Josh Costello calledLittle Brother. The play was augmented with animated video projections, an original score by Chris Houston and original choreography by Daunielle Rasmussen.

Marin Independentsaid thatLittle Brotheris "required watching!'[26]

Charlie Jane Andersofio9praised theLittle Brotherplay: "I was lucky enough to catch a preview performance of the Custom Made Theatre Co.'s new stage adaptation of Cory Doctorow's award-winning novelLittle Brotherthe other day—and it was a total marvel. Somehow, writer/director Josh Costello managed to condense the novel down to a two-hour play, without losing any of the impact. If anything, the staged version hits a bit harder than the book, because of the intense, but not overstated, performances."[27]

According toTheatreStorm, "Costello has wisely tightened Doctorow's book to three main characters. On a nearly empty stage, Costello utilizes video and sound effects superbly, creating multiple San Francisco locations, mass demonstrations, press conferences, online experiences and coaching his actors to create multiple characterizations as necessary. This is the best kind of political theatre. Thought provoking, suspenseful, emotionally real, uncomfortably close to the hard truth."[28]

The novel has also been the subject of a possible movie. The production company AngryFilms has optionedLittle Brother"with the aim of translating it to the big screen."[29]

In September 2015, Doctorow announced on his blog thatLittle Brotherhad been optioned byParamountwithDon Murphyas the producer.[30]

In reference toLittle Brother,Cory Doctorowhas stated that "the enemy is obscurity, not piracy." His bookLittle Brotheris available on his website for free, which is provided in a variety of formats.[31][32]

On June 20, 2012, Doctorow posted the cover art of the sequel toLittle Brother, titledHomeland.[33]An excerpt of the book's opening, set at theBurning Manfestival, was posted the next month on the Tor Books website.[34]Homelandwas released in hardback, and for download under a Creative Commons license on Doctorow's website, in February 2013.
