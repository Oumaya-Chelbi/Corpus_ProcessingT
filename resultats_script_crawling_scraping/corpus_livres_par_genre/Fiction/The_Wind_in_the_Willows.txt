With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, "Hang spring cleaning!" He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with "Ratty" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had "read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends".[12]

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that "Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'..."[34]
