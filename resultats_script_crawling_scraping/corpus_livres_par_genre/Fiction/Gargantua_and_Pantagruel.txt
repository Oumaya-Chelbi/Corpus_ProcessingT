The original title of the work wasPantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables.[8]Although most modern editions of Rabelais' work placePantagruelas the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under thepen name"Alcofribas Nasier",[8]ananagramofFrançois Rabelais.

Inspired by an anonymous book,The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua(in French,Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua),Pantagruelis offered as a book of the same sort.

The narrative begins with the origin of giants; Pantagruel's particular genealogy; and his birth. His childhood is briefly covered, before his father sends him away to the universities. He acquires a great reputation. On receiving a letter with news that his father has been translated toFairylandbyMorgan le Fay, and that the Dipsodes, hearing of it, have invaded his land and are besieging a city, Pantagruel and his companions depart.

Through subterfuge, might, and urine, the besieged city is relieved, and their residents are invited to invade the Dipsodes, who mostly surrender to Pantagruel as he and his army approach their towns. During a downpour, Pantagruel shelters his army with his tongue, and the narrator travels into Pantagruel's mouth. He returns some months later and learns that the hostilities are over.
