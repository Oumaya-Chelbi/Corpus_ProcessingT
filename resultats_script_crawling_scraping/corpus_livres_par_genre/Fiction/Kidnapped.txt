The novel opens in the (fictional) village of Essendean in theEttrick Forestarea of theScottish Lowlandsin 1751. The main character and narrator is 17-year-old[a]David Balfour whose sole remaining parent, his father, has recently died. The minister of Essendean, Mr. Campbell, hands David a sealed letter left by his father with instructions that it be delivered to his father’s brother, Ebenezer, at his family's ancestral estate, the House of Shaws inCramond. Mr. Campbell tells David that he believes the letter may well prove to be advantageous to him.

After two day's walk cross country, David arrives at the ominous House of Shaws. There he is confronted by the paranoid Ebenezer with a loadedblunderbuss. His uncle is miserly, living on "parritch" andsmall ale, and the House of Shaws itself is partially unfinished and somewhat ruinous. David is allowed to stay and soon discovers evidence that his father may have been older than his uncle, thus making David the rightful heir to the estate. Ebenezer asks David to get a chest from the top of a tower in the house but refuses to provide a lamp or candle. David is forced to scale the stairs in the dark and realises that not only is the tower unfinished in some places, but the steps simply end abruptly and fall into an abyss. David concludes that his uncle intended for him to have an "accident", perhaps so as not to have to give over his nephew's inheritance.

David confronts his uncle, who promises to address the matter the next morning. A ship'scabin boy, Ransome, arrives the next morning and tells Ebenezer that Captain Hoseason of thebrigCovenantneeds to meet him to discuss business. Ebenezer takes David to a pier on theFirth of Forth, where Hoseason awaits, and David makes the mistake of leaving his uncle alone with the captain while he visits the shore with Ransome. Hoseason later offers to take them on board the brig for a drink and a brief tour, and David complies, only to see his uncle returning to shore alone in askiff. David is then immediately struck senseless.

David awakens, bound hand and foot, in the hold of the ship, and learns that per arrangement with David's uncle, the captain plans to sell him intoindentured servitudeinthe Carolinas. But the ship encounters contrary winds, which drive her back toward Scotland. Fog-bound near theHebrides, they strike a small boat. All of the small boat's crew are killed except one man,Alan Breck Stewart, who is brought on board and offers Hoseason a large sum of money to drop him off on the mainland. David later overhears the crew plotting to kill Alan instead. David and Alan barricade themselves in the roundhouse, where Alan kills the murderous helmsman and David wounds Hoseason. Alan then demonstrates his superior fighting skills as he easily kills five more men and intimidates the remaining crew into backing down.

Hoseason has no choice but to give Alan and David passage back to the mainland. David tells his tale to Alan, who in turn states that his birthplace, Appin, is under the tyrannical administration ofColin Roy of Glenure, the King'sfactorand a Campbell. Alan, who is a Jacobite agent and wears a French uniform, vows that should he find the "Red Fox" he will kill him.

TheCovenanttries to negotiate a difficult channel without a proper chart or pilot and is soon driven aground on the notoriousTorran Rocks. David and Alan are separated in the confusion, with David being washed ashore on the isle ofErraid, nearMull, while Alan and the surviving crew row to safety on that same island. David spends a few days alone in the wild before getting his bearings.

David learns that his new friend has survived, and David has two encounters with beggarly guides: one who attempts to stab him with a knife, and another who is blind but an excellent shot with a pistol. David soon reachesTorosay, where he is ferried across the river, receives further instructions from Alan's friend Neil Roy McRob, and later meets acatechistwho takes the lad to the mainland.

As he continues his journey, David encounters none other than the Red Fox, Colin Roy Campbell himself, who is accompanied by a lawyer, a servant, and a sheriff's officer. When David stops the Campbell man to ask him for directions, a hidden sniperkillsthe King's hated agent.

David is denounced as a conspirator and flees for his life, but by chance reunites with Alan. The youth believes Alan is the assassin, but Alan denies responsibility. Alan and David then begin their flight through theheather, hiding from government soldiers by day.  As the trek drains David's strength, his health rapidly deteriorates; by the time they are set upon by wild Highlanders who are sentries forCluny Macpherson, an outlawed chief in hiding, the lad is barely conscious. Alan convinces Cluny to give them shelter, and David is tended by a Highland doctor. He soon recovers, though in the meantime Alan loses all of their money at cards with Cluny, only for Cluny to give it back when David practically begs for it.

When David and Alan resume their flight in cold and rainy weather, David becomes ill again, and Alan carries him on his back down theburnto reach the nearest house, fortuitously that of aMaclaren, Duncan Dhu, who is both an ally of the Stewarts and a skilledpiper. David is bedridden and given a doctor's care, while Alan hides nearby, visiting after dark.

In one of the most humorous passages in the book, Alan convinces an innkeeper's daughter fromLimekilns(unnamed inKidnappedbut called "Alison Hastie" in its sequel) that David is a dying young Jacobite nobleman, despite David's objections, and she ferries them across the Firth of Forth. There, they meet a lawyer of David's uncle's, Mr. Rankeillor, who agrees to help David properly claim his inheritance. Rankeillor explains that David's father and uncle had once quarrelled over a woman, David's mother, and the older Balfour had married her, informally giving the estate to his brother to settle their dispute while living as an impoverished schoolteacher with his wife. This agreement had lapsed with his death.

David and the lawyer hide in bushes outside Ebenezer's house while Alan speaks to him, claiming to be a man who found David nearly dead after the wreck of theCovenantand says he is representing folk holding him captive in the Hebrides. He asks David's uncle whether Alan should kill David or keep him. The uncle flatly denies Alan's statement that David had been kidnapped but eventually admits that he paid Hoseason "twenty pound" to take David to "Caroliny". David and Rankeillor then emerge from their hiding places, and speak with Ebenezer in the kitchen, eventually agreeing that David will be provided two-thirds of the estate's income for as long as his uncle lives.

The novel ends with David and Alan parting ways onCorstorphine Hill; Alan returns to France, and David goes to a local bank to receive his money.

Kidnappedis ahistorical romance, but by the time it was written, attitudes towards the genre had evolved from the earlier insistence on historical accuracy to one of faithfulness to the spirit of a bygone age. In the words of a critic writing inBentley's Miscellany, the historical novelist "must follow rather the poetry of history than its chronology: his business is not to be the slave of dates; he ought to be faithful to the character of the epoch".[3]Indeed, in the preface toKidnappedStevenson warns the reader that historical accuracy was not primarily his aim, remarking "how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy".[4]

Stevenson presents the Jacobite version of theAppin murderin the novel,[2]but sets the events in 1751, whereas the murder occurred in 1752.[5]

Kidnappedwas first published in the magazineYoung Folksfrom May to July 1886, and as a novel in the same year.

Robert Louis Stevenson(1850–1894) planned to write this story as early as 1880. He immersed himself in books on Scotland in the early and middle 18th century in preparation for writing. He was born and raised in Edinburgh, then travelled in England, France and the US. After his father died, he took his wife, children and his own mother as he traveled in search of a place more salutary to his health, finally building a house inSamoa, where he later died at age 44. He wroteKidnappedon his stay in England.

Stevenson remains one of the most popular and revered writers in the history of the English language, and was extremely prolific. His other works includeTreasure IslandandStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

A central theme of the novel is the concept of justice, the imperfections of the justice system and the lack of a universal definition of justice. To David justice means the restoration of his inheritance, whereas for Alan it means the death of his enemy Colin Roy of Glenure.

Literary critic Leslie Fiedler has suggested that a unifying "mythic concept" in several of Stevenson's books, includingKidnapped, is what might be called the "Beloved Scoundrel", or the "Devil as Angel", "the beauty of evil".[6]The Rogue in this instance is of course Alan, "a rebel, a deserter, perhaps a murderer ... without a shred of Christian morality".[7]Good nevertheless triumphs over evil, as in David Balfour's situation.

Kidnappedwas well received and sold well while Stevenson was alive. After his death many viewed it with scepticism, seeing it as simply a boys' novel. By the mid-20th century it had regained critical approval and study. The novel has attracted the praise and admiration of writers as diverse asHenry James,Jorge Luis Borges, andHilary Mantel.[1]

While it is basically an adventure novel, it raises various moral issues, such as the nature of justice and the fact that friends may have different political viewpoints.

A sequel,Catriona, was published in 1893.[8]

The novel has been adapted a number of times, and in multiple media.

Film and television versions were made in1917,1938,1948,1960, 1968,1971,1978,1986,1995and2005.

An adaptation for the stage byKeith Dewhurstwas produced by theRoyal Lyceum Theatre Company, Edinburgh in August 1972, withPaul Youngas David Balfour, James Grant asAlan Breck Stewart, and music bySteeleye Span.[9]

A four-part adaptation written byCatherine Czerkawskaand starringDavid Rintoulas David Balfour andPaul Youngas Alan Breck Stewart was broadcast onBBC Radio 4in 1985. A more recent two-part adaptation written byChris Dolanand starring Owen Whitelaw as David Balfour andMichael Nardoneas Alan Breck was broadcast also on BBC Radio 4 in 2016.[10]

Marvel Illustratedpublished acomic bookversion in 2007–2008, byRoy ThomasandMario Gully, who had previously adaptedTreasure Island.[11]

In 2023 theNational Theatre of Scotlandperformeda new stage adaptation, which featuredFrances Stevensonas narrator and reimagined the relationship between David Balfour and Alan Breck Stewart as a romance.[12][13]

It has been speculated that the novel was inspired in part by the true story from earlier in the 18th century ofJames Annesley, heir to five aristocratic titles who was kidnapped at the age of 12 by his uncleRichardand shipped fromDublinto America in 1728.[14]He managed to escape after 13 years and return to reclaim his birthright from his uncle in one of the longest courtroom dramas of its time.[15]Kidnappeddoes not end in the way Annesley's life story did, as the ship on which the main character was kidnapped never got beyond Scotland, allowing for a rich story of Scotland, highlands and lowlands. Further, a key event in the plot happens when David is present when Colin Roy Campbell falls dead from the unseen murderer's bullet.

Annesley biographer Ekirch felt in his response to a remark in the review of his book that "It is inconceivable that Stevenson, a voracious reader of legal history, was unfamiliar with the saga of James Annesley, which by the time ofKidnapped'spublication in 1886 had already influenced four other 19th-century novels, most famouslySir Walter Scott'sGuy Mannering(1815) andCharles Reade'sThe Wandering Heir(1873)."[14][15]The Scottish authorAndro Linklater, who reviewed the book forThe Spectator, disagreed with this contention.[16]The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, did not mention the earlier historic event in the novel, nor in his correspondence; instead he namesThe Trial of James Stewartfor themurder of Colin Roy Campbell at Appinas an inspiration, according to his wife.[16]

As part of the events to celebrateEdinburghbecoming the firstUNESCOCity of Literature,[18]three versions ofKidnappedwere made freely available by being left in public places around the city.[19]Throughout February 2007, 25,000 copies of the novel were distributed in that way.[20]

A statue honouring Stevenson through a depiction of the two main characters fromKidnapped, Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour, was unveiled bySean Conneryin 2004 in Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh. The location for the work, which is by Scottish sculptorAlexander Stoddart, is where, in the novel, the two friends part ways.[21]
