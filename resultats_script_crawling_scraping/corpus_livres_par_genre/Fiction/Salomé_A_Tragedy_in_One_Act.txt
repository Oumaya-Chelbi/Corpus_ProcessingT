Jokanaan (John the Baptist, Iokanaan in the original French text) has been imprisoned by Herod Antipas in acisternbelow the terrace of Herod's palace, for his hostile comments about Herodias, Herod's second wife. A young captain of the guard admires the beautiful princess Salome, Herod's stepdaughter. A page warns the captain that something terrible may happen if he continues to stare at the princess. Salome is fascinated by Jokanaan's voice. She persuades the captain to open the cistern so that the prophet can emerge, and she can see him and touch him.[22]Jokanaan appears, denouncing Herodias and her husband. At first frightened by the sight of the holy man, Salome becomes fascinated by him, begging him to let her touch his hair, his skin and kiss his mouth. When she tells him she is Herodias's daughter, he calls her a "daughter of Sodom" and bids her keep away from him. All Salome's attempts to attract him fail, and he swears she will never kiss his mouth, cursing her as the daughter of an adulteress and advising her to seek the Lord. He returns to his underground confinement. The young captain of the guard, unable to bear Salome's desire for another man, fatally stabs himself.[23]

Herod appears from the palace, looking for the princess and commenting on the strange look of the moon. When he slips in the captain's blood, he suddenly panics. Herodias dismisses his fears and asks him to go back inside with her, but Herod's attention has turned libidinously towards Salome, who rejects his advances. From the cistern, Jokanaan resumes his denunciation of Herodias; she demands that Herod hand the prophet over to the Jews. Herod refuses, maintaining that Jokanaan is a holy man and has seen God. His words spark an argument among the Jews concerning the true nature of God, and two Nazarenes talk about the miracles of Jesus. As Jokanaan continues to accuse her, Herodias demands that he is silenced.[24]

Herod asks Salome to dance for him. She refuses, but when he promises to give her anything she wants, she agrees. Ignoring her mother's pleas – "Ne dansez pas, ma fille" – "Do not dance, my daughter" – Salome performs thedance of the seven veils.[n 8]Delighted, Herod asks what reward she would like, and she asks for the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter. Horrified, Herod refuses, while Herodias rejoices at Salome's choice. Herod offers other rewards, but Salome insists and reminds Herod of his promise. He finally yields. The executioner descends into the cistern, and Salome impatiently awaits her reward. When the prophet's head is brought to her, she passionately addresses Jokanaan as if he were still alive and finally kisses his lips:

Herod, frightened and appalled at Salome's behaviour, orders the soldiers, "Tuez cette femme!" – "Kill that woman!", and they crush her to death under their shields.[27]

In 1901, within a year of Wilde's death,Salomewas produced in Berlin byMax ReinhardtinHedwig Lachmann's German translation,[28]and ran, according toRobbie Ross, for "a longer consecutive period in Germany than any play by any Englishman, not excepting Shakespeare".[29]The play was not revived in Paris until 1973 (althoughRichard Strauss'soperatic versionwas frequently seen there from 1910 onwards).[30]Les Archives du spectaclerecord 13 productions of Wilde's play in France between 1973 and 2020.[30]

The American premiere was given in New York in 1905 by the Progressive Stage Society, an amateur group. A professional production was presented at theAstor Theatrethe following year, withMercedes Leighin the title role.[31]TheInternet Broadway Databaserecords five New York productions between 1917 and 2003.[32]The Salomes includedEvelyn Preer(1923),Sheryl Lee(1992) andMarisa Tomei(2003), and among the actors playing Herod wasAl Pacinoin 1992 and 2003.[32]

The play was given in Czech inBrnoin 1924, and in English at theGate Theatrein Dublin in 1928 (directed byHilton Edwards, withMicheál Mac Liammóiras Jokanaan).[33]In Tokyo in 1960Yukio Mishimadirected a Japanese version in a translation byKōnosuke Hinatsuwhich,The Timesreported, "rendered Wilde's rhetoric into the measured cadences of fifteenth-century Japanese".[34]A later Japanese production was seen in Tokyo and subsequently in France in 1996.[35]

In Britain, the Lord Chamberlain's consent to public performance still being withheld, the first production there was given in May 1905 in a private performance in London by the New Stage Club, in which the performance ofRobert Farquharsonas Herod was reportedly of remarkable power.[36]Millicent Murbyplayed Salome, andFlorence Farrdirected. A second private performance followed in 1906 by the Literary Theatre Society, with Farquharson again as Herod.[37]The costumes and scenery byCharles Rickettswere much admired, but the rest of the cast and the direction were poor, according to Ross.[38]A 1911 production at theCourt TheatrebyHarcourt Williams, withAdeline Bourneas Salome, received disparaging notices.[39]

The ban on public performance of Salome was not lifted until 1931. The last "private" production, earlier that year, featuring a dance of the seven veils choreographed byNinette de Valois, was judged "creepily impressive" byThe Daily Telegraph.[40]For the first sanctioned public production, at theSavoy Theatre, Farquharson reprised his Herod, with real-life mother and daughter casting,Nancy PriceandJoan Maudeas Herodias and Salome. The production was deemed tame and unthrilling, and the play – "gone modest and middle class" as one critic put it – was not seen again in the West End for more than twenty years.[41]

A 1954 London revival, a vehicle for the Australian actorFrank Thring, made little impact, and it was not untilLindsay Kemp's 1977 production at theRoundhousethatSalomewas established as a critical and box-office success, running for six months in repertory with Kemp's adaptation ofOur Lady of the Flowers.[42][43]That version was a free adaptation of the original, with an all-male cast, switching between French and English texts and using only about a third of Wilde's dialogue.[42]A 1988 production bySteven Berkoffin which he played Herod, was seen at the Gate Theatre, theEdinburgh Festivaland at theNational Theatre, London. It focused on Wilde's words, relying on the skills of the actors and the imagination of audiences to evoke the setting and action.[44]A 2017 production by theRoyal Shakespeare Company, described as "gender fluid", featured a male actor,Matthew Tennyson, as Salome.[45]

InLes Annales du théâtre et de la musique, Edouard Stoullig reported that press reviews had been generally benevolent out of protest at the harsh treatment received by Wilde in Britain. In Stoullig's view the play was a good piece of rhetoric marred by too many "ridiculous repetitions" of lines by minor characters.[12]InLe FigaroHenry Fouquiershared Stoullig's view that the piece owed something to Flaubert, and thought it "an exercise in romantic literature, not badly done, a little boring".[11]The reviewer inLe Tempssaid, "M. Wilde has certainly read Flaubert, and cannot forget it. The most interesting thing aboutSalomeis the style. The work was written in French by M. Wilde. It is full of very elaborate and ornate verses. The colours, the stars, the birds, the rare gems, everything that adorns nature, has provided M. Wilde with points of comparison and ingenious themes for the stanzas andantistrophesthatSalome'scharacters utter".[46]La Plumesaid, "Saloméhas almost all the qualities of a poem, the prose is as musical and fluid as verse, full of images and metaphors".[47]

When banning the original 1892 production ofSalome, the responsible official in the Lord Chamberlain's office commented privately, "The piece is written in French – half Biblical, half pornographic – by Oscar Wilde himself. Imagine the average British public's reception of it".[48]In Britain the critics in general either ignored or disparaged the play.The Timesdescribed it as "an arrangement in blood and ferocity, morbid, bizarre, repulsive, and very offensive in its adaptation of scriptural phraseology to situations the reverse of sacred".[49]The Pall Mall Gazettesuggested that the play was far from original: "the reader ofSalomeseems to stand in the Island of Voices, and to hear around him and about the utterances of friends, the whisperings of demigods" – particularlyGautier, Maeterlinck and above all Flaubert – "There is no freshness in Mr Wilde's ideas; there is no freshness in his method of presenting those ideas".[50]New York reviewers were not impressed when the play was first professionally produced there in 1906:The Suncalled it "bloodily degenerate";The New-York Tribunethought it "decadent stuff, not worthy of notice".[31]

Raby comments that later criticism of the play "has tended to treat it either as a literary text or as a theatrical aberration".[51]The historian John Stokes writes thatSalomeis a rare instance in British theatrical history of an authenticallySymbolistdrama. Symbolist authors rejected naturalism and used "poetic language and pictorial settings to invoke the inner lives of characters", expressing without the constraints of naturalism all kinds of emotions "both spiritual and sensual".[52]
