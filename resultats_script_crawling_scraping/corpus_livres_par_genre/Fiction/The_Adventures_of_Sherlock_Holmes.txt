All of the stories withinThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesare told in afirst-person narrativefrom the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories.[7]TheOxford Dictionary of National Biographyentry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmestend to point out social injustices, such as "a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent."[1]It suggests that, in contrast,  Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of "official incompetence and aristocratic privilege".[1]The Adventures of Sherlock Holmescontains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories toThe Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" (as his favourite), "The Red-Headed League" (second), "A Scandal in Bohemia" (fifth) and "The Five Orange Pips" (seventh).[8]The book was banned in theSoviet Unionin 1929 because of its alleged "occultism",[9]but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.[10]

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of "A Scandal in Bohemia" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being "worthy of the inventive genius" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it "might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago", but that "the unique power" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, "with all his little foibles",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as "rather a bore sometimes", noting that descriptions of his foibles "grows wearisome".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author "who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, "A Scandal in Bohemia", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: "It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler."[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes "the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection."[34]
