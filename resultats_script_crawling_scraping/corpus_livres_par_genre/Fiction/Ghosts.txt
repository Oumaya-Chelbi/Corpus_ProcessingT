Helen Alving is about to dedicate anorphanage, which she has built in memory of her late husband, Captain Alving. Despite her husband's affairs, Mrs. Alving stayed with him to protect her son Oswald from the taint of scandal and for fear of being shunned by the community.

In the course of the play, she discovers that Oswald (whom she had sent away to avoid his being corrupted by his father) is suffering fromsyphilis, which she believes he inherited from his father.[a]She also discovers that Oswald has fallen in love with her maid Regina Engstrand, who is revealed to be the illegitimate daughter of Captain Alving and is therefore Oswald'shalf-sister.

A sub-plot involves a carpenter, Jacob Engstrand, who married Regina's mother when she was already pregnant. He regards Regina as his own daughter. He is unaware, or pretends to be, that Captain Alving was Regina's father. Having recently completed his work building Mrs. Alving's orphanage, Engstrand announces his ambition to open a hostel forseafarers. He tries to persuade Regina to leave Mrs. Alving and help him run the hostel, but she refuses. The night before the orphanage is due to open, Engstrand asksPastorManders to hold a prayer-meeting there. Later that night, the orphanage burns down. Earlier, Manders had persuaded Mrs. Alving not to insure the orphanage, as to do so would imply a lack of faith in divine providence. Engstrand says the blaze was caused by Manders' carelessness with a candle and offers to take the blame, which Manders readily accepts. Manders in turn offers to support Engstrand's hostel.

When Regina and Oswald's sibling relationship is exposed, Regina departs, leaving Oswald in anguish. He asks his mother to help him avoid the late stages of syphilis with a fatalmorphineoverdose. She agrees, but only if it becomes necessary. The play concludes with Mrs. Alving having to confront the decision of whether or not toeuthanizeher son in accordance with his wishes.[3]

As with his other plays,Henrik IbsenwroteGhostsin Danish, the common written language of Denmark and Norway at the time. The original title, in both Danish and Norwegian, isGengangere, which can be literally translated as "again walkers", "ones who return", or "revenants".[7]It has a double meaning of both "ghosts" and "events that repeat themselves" which the English titleGhostsfails to capture.

Ibsen wroteGhostsduring the autumn of 1881 and published it that December.[10]As early as November 1880, when he was living in Rome, he had been meditating on a new play to followA Doll's House. When he went toSorrento, in the summer of 1881, he was hard at work upon it. He finished it by the end of November 1881[11]and published it inCopenhagenon 13 December 1881.

Ghostswas published in Copenhagen on 13 December 1881 in an edition of 10,000 copies.[2]It caused a firestorm of public outcry,[2]and most of the 10,000 copies did not sell, which was financially a severe blow for Ibsen.[2][12]A subsequent print run of the text was not published until 1894.[2]

The play was initially sent to a number of Nordic theaters, including the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, the Nya Teatern and Dramaten in Stockholm, and the Christiania Theater, but all of them rejected the play.[2]In the early 1880s, the play was generally rejected by all major European playhouses, including those in Norway.[12]

Upon the publication of the text,[2]Ibsen's contemporaries found the play shocking and indecent and disliked its frank treatment of the forbidden topic ofvenereal disease. At the time, the mere mention of venereal disease was scandalous, and to show that a person who followed society's ideals of morality was at risk from her own husband was considered beyond the pale. According to Richard Eyre, "There was an outcry of indignation against the attack on religion, the defence of free love, the mention of incest and syphilis."[9]

Ghostspremiered in May 1882 in the United States, produced in Danish for Scandinavian immigrants by a Danish-Norwegian cast inChicago, at the Aurora Turner Hall.[2][13]The first performance in Sweden was atHelsingborgon 22 August 1883.[11]Ghostswas produced in Norway in October 1883, and it received good reviews.[2][9]It was produced independently in September 1889 at Berlin'sDie Freie Bühne.[14]

The play achieved a single private London performance on 13 March 1891 at theRoyalty Theatre, which was its English-language premiere.[13]The issue ofLord Chamberlain's Officecensorship, because of the subject matter of illegitimate children and sexually transmitted disease, was avoided by the formation of a subscription-onlyIndependent Theatre Societyto produce the play. Its members included playwrightGeorge Bernard Shawand authorsThomas HardyandHenry James.[15]The play was reviled in the press. In a typical review at the time,The Daily Telegraphreferred to it as "Ibsen's positively abominable play entitledGhosts.... An open drain: a loathsome sore unbandaged; a dirty act done publicly.... A lazar house with all its doors and windows open ... Gross, almost putrid indecorum.... Literary carrion.... Crapulous stuff".[16]

In 1898 when Ibsen was presented to KingOscar IIof Sweden and Norway, at a dinner in Ibsen's honour, the King told Ibsen thatGhostswas not a good play. After a pause, Ibsen exploded, "Your Majesty, Ihadto writeGhosts!"[17][18][19]Ghostshad its first New York City production, and its first English-language production in the U.S., onBroadwayon 5 January 1894 at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre.[20][21]It was produced again in 1899 by the New York Independent Theatre withMary Shawas Mrs. Alving.[11]

Russian actressAlla Nazimova, with Paul Orleneff, gave a notable production ofGhostsin a small room on theLower East Sidein 1895–96.[11]When Nazimova had been a student in Russia, she had wanted to "play Regina for my graduation piece at the dramatic school at Moscow, but they would not let me.Ghostswas at that time prohibited by the censor, because it reflects on the Church."[11]

The play later received many European performances. In its 1906 production in Berlin, the Norwegian artistEdvard Munchwas commissioned to create the original stage designs.[22]On 4 May 1962, the play was performed in the Theatre Sala Chopin in Mexico City with Mexican actress and Hollywood starDolores del Ríoin the role of Mrs. Alving.[23]
