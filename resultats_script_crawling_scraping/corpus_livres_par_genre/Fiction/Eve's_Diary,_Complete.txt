It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the biblical creation story,Eve, and is claimed to be "translated from the original MS."  The "plot" of this story is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by her mateAdam, including meeting and getting to know him, and exploring the world around her,Eden.  The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden.

It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story ofAdam and Eve, includingExtracts from Adam's Diary, 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.'  "Eve's Diary" has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love.

The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wifeOlivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written.  Mark Twain is quoted as saying, "'Eve's Diary' is finished â€” I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more."  The story ends with Adam lamenting at Eve's grave, "Wheresoever she was, there was Eden."

The book version of the story was published with 55 illustrations byLester Ralph, on each left hand page. The illustrations depicted Eve and Adam in their natural settings.

A library inCharlton, Massachusettsbanned the book for the depictions of Eve in "summer costume."
