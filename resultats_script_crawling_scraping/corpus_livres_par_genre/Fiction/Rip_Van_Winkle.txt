Rip Van Winkle, a Dutch American man with a habit of avoiding useful work, lives in a village at the foot of theCatskill Mountainsin the years before theAmerican Revolution. One day, he goes squirrel hunting in the mountains with his dog, Wolf, to escape his wife's irritation. As evening falls, he hears a voice calling his name and finds a man dressed in old-fashioned Dutch clothing and carrying akeg. Rip helps the man carry his burden to a cleft in the rocks from which thunderous noises are emanating; the source proves to be a group of bearded men wearing similar outfits playingnine-pin bowling. Not asking who these men are or how they know his name, Rip joins them in drinking bottles of alcohol from the keg he has helped carry and soon becomes so drunk that he falls asleep.

Rip awakens on a sunny morning, at the spot where he first saw the keg-carrier, and finds that many drastic changes have occurred; his beard is a foot long and has turned grey, hismusketis badly deteriorated, and Wolf is nowhere to be found. Returning to his village, he discovers it to be larger than he remembers and filled with people in unfamiliar clothing, none of whom recognize him. When asked how he voted in the election that has just been held, he declares himself a loyal subject ofGeorge III, unaware that theAmerican Revolutionary Warhas taken place in his absence. He learns that many of his old friends either were killed in the war or have left the village and is disturbed to find a young man who shares his name, mannerisms, and younger appearance. A young woman states that her father is Rip Van Winkle, who has been missing for 21 years, and an old woman recognises him as Rip. The young woman and the young Rip are his children, and the former has named her infant son after him as well.

Rip discovers that his wife has been dead for some time but is not saddened by the news. He learns via a village elder that the men he met in the mountains are told to be ghosts of the crew of theDutch East India CompanyshipHalve Maen. His daughter takes him into her home, and he soon resumes his usual idleness (unconcerned by the major political changes during his slumber) and begins telling his story to every stranger who visits the village. The tale is solemnly taken to heart (despite some assuming him to be insane) by the settlers, particularly by the old Dutch inhabitants who say that, whenever thunder is heard, the men in the mountains must be playing ninepins.

After a failed business venture with his brothers, Irving filed for bankruptcy in 1818.[3]Despondent, he turned to writing for possible financial support, although he haddifficulty thinking of stories to write. He stayed inBirmingham, England, where his brother-in-lawHenry van Warthad opened a trading firm.[4]The two were reminiscing in June 1818 when Irving was suddenly inspired by their nostalgic conversation.[5]Irving locked himself in his room and wrote nonstop all night. As he said, he felt like a man waking from a long sleep. He presented the first draft of "Rip Van Winkle" to the van Wart family over breakfast.[6]

"Rip Van Winkle" was one of the first stories Irving proposed for his new bookThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.Irving asked his brother Ebenezer to assist with publication in the United States. As Irving wrote, "I shall feel very anxious to hear of the success of this first re-appearance on the literary stage – Should it be successful, I trust I shall be able henceforth to keep up an occasional fire."[7][8]A British edition was published shortly afterward, by John Miller, who went out of business immediately thereafter. With help from his friendWalter Scott, Irving was able to convinceJohn Murrayto take over British publication of theSketch Book.[9]

Following the success of "Rip Van Winkle" in print and onstage, later celebrated editions were illustrated byArthur Rackham(Heinemann, 1905) andN.C. Wyeth(McKay, 1921).

The story of "Rip Van Winkle" itself is widely thought to have been based onJohann Karl Christoph Nachtigal's German folktale "Peter Klaus",[5][10]which is a shorter story set in a German village. It tells of a goatherd named Peter Klaus who goes looking for a lost goat. He finds some men drinking in the woods and after drinking some of their wine, falls asleep. When he wakes up, twenty years have passed.[5][11]

The story also bears some similarities to stories from East Asia, including the third-century AD Chinese tale of "Ranka", as retold byLionel GilesinA Gallery of Chinese Immortals, and the eighth-centuryJapanese tale"Urashima Tarō".[10]The Hindu story ofMuchukundafrom theBhagavatamalso displays many similarities to the story of "Rip Van Winkle".[12][13]

In Christian tradition, there is a similar, well-known story of "TheSeven SleepersofEphesus", which recounts a group of early Christians who hid in a cave circa 250 AD to escape the persecution of Christians during the reign of theRomanemperorDecius. They fell into a miraculous sleep and woke some 200 years later during the reign ofTheodosius IIto discover that the city and the whole Empire had become Christian.[10]This Christian story is recounted byIslamand appears in a famousSuraof theQuran, SuraAl-Kahf.[14]The version recalls a group of young monotheists escaping from persecution within a cave and emerging hundreds of years later.[15]

One story in Judaism concernsHoni HaMe'agel, a miracle-working sage of the 1st century BC, who was a historical character but to whom various myths were attached. While traveling one day, Honi saw a man planting acarobtree and asked him about it. The man explained that the tree would take 70 years to bear fruit and that he was planting it not for himself but for the generations to follow him. Later that day, Honi sat down to rest but fell asleep for 70 years; when he awoke, he saw a man picking fruit from a fully mature carob tree. Asked whether he had planted it, the man replied that he had not but that his grandfather had planted it for him.[16][17]

Another similar story in the Islamic tradition is ofUzair(usually identified with the BiblicalEzra), whose grief at theDestruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonianswas so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness, and she could see again. He meets his son, who recognizes him by a mole between his shoulders and is older than he was.[18][19](seeUzair#Islamic tradition and literature).

Albert Einstein'stheory of relativity, under which a person traveling at near light speed would experience only the passage of a few years but would return to find centuries had passed on Earth, provides a broad new scope to express essentially the same literary theme – for example, in the opening chapter ofUrsula K. Le Guin'sRocannon's World. InRobert Heinlein'sTime for the Stars, Earth sends out a fleet of relativistic ships to explore the galaxy, their crews hailed as stalwart pioneers – but after a century, which they experience as only a few years, faster-than-light ships are developed and the earlier ones are recalled, their crews discovering that they had become unwanted anachronisms on a changed Earth. The protagonist notices a newspaper headline disparagingly announcing the arrival of himself and his shipmates as "yet another crew of Rip Van Winkles".

In the tenth chapter of his bookLives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, the third-century AD Greek historianDiogenes Laërtiusrelates the story of the legendary sageEpimenides of Knossos, who was said to have been a shepherd on the island ofCrete.[20][21]One day, Epimenides followed after a sheep that had wandered off and after becoming tired, went into a cave underMount Idaand fell asleep. When he awoke, he continued searching for the sheep but could not find it, so he returned to his father's farm, only to discover that it was under new ownership. He went home, only to discover that the people there did not know him. Finally, he encountered his younger brother, who had become an old man, and learned that he had been asleep in the cave for fifty-seven years.[20][21]According to the different sources that Diogenes relates, Epimenides lived to be 154, 157, or 299 years old.[22]Multiple sources have identified the story of Epimenides as the earliest known variant of the "Rip Van Winkle" fairy tale.[20][21][23][10][24]

The theme is taken up in numerous modern works of science fiction. InH. G. Wells'sThe Sleeper Awakes, a man who sleeps for 203 years wakes up in a completely transformed London, where he has become the richest man in the world. In the originalBuck Rogersbook, the protagonist falls asleep under the influence of a gas in a mine, sleeps for four centuries, and wakes to find America under the rule of Mongol invaders – whereupon he places himself at the head of the freedom fighters. InRoger Zelazny'sscience-fantasyseriesThe Chronicles of Amber, protagonist Corwyn experiences drinking and revelry in an underground lair with otherworldly people who try to entice him into slumber; he knows this is a centuries-of-sleep trap and resists; the passage is similar in theme to both "Rip Van Winkle" and especially the Orkney story. The movieTime Trapalso bears some similarities.

The story has been adapted for other media over the past two centuries, in cartoons, films, stage plays, music, and other media.

There is astatue of Rip Van Winklein Irvington, New York. A sculpture of Rip Van Winkle can also be found near the summit of theHunter Mountain Ski Resortin the Catskills.
