The dreary succession of randomly selectedKings of Englandis broken up when Auberon Quin, who cares for nothing but a good joke, is chosen.  To amuse himself, he institutes elaborate costumes for the provosts of the districts of London.  All are bored by the King's antics except for one earnest young man who takes the cry for regional pride seriously – Adam Wayne, the eponymousNapoleonofNotting Hill.

Michael Collins, who led the fight for Ireland's secession from theUnited Kingdom, is known to have admired the book.[1]There has been speculation that the setting of the book prompted the date chosen for the setting ofGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four;[2]the Japanese translation of the book, the cover of which was illustrated byHayao Miyazaki, bore the primary titleChesterton's 1984. The novel is also quoted at the start ofNeil Gaiman's novelNeverwhere.
