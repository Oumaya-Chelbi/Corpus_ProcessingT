Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein,"Victor Frankenstein, son of an upper-classGenevesefamily, spends his youth obsessed withalchemy. As he grows older, he develops an interest in modern sciences such aschemistryandelectricity. After his mother Caroline dies ofscarlet fever, Victor leaves home to attend theUniversity of Ingolstadt. Through his studies, Victor discovers a new way to create life, which he uses to create alarge and grotesque humanoid creature. Whenthe creatureawakens, Victor flees in terror. He returns to find the creature gone.

The newly conscious creature runs away, discovers fire, and learns to avoid humans, who find him frightening. He finds ahovelattached to a small house, which lets him observe a family while remaining unseen. As the family teaches their language to a foreigner, the creature also learns to speak and write. He also finds a collection of books, includingParadise Lost, and learns to read. When he finally reveals himself to the family, they are horrified by his appearance and chase him away. The creature then saves a young girl from drowning, only to be shot by her father, who perceives his rescue as an attack.

Angry at humanity, the creature returns to Geneva to find Victor, and instead meets Victor's brother William. Realizing that William belongs to the same family, the creature kills him, then frames the Frankensteins' servant Justine for his death. Victor suspects his creature was responsible, but does not intervene while Justine is tried and executed. Later, while hiking onMer de Glace, Victor encounters the creature again. The creature relays his story and asks Victor to create a female companion, which he believes will be his only chance at happiness. Victor agrees.

Victor and his friend Henry Clerval leave the European mainland forBritain, where Victor establishes a laboratory inOrkney. While working on the female creature, Victor worries about his creations giving birth, and decides to destroy the incomplete female instead. In retaliation, the original creature murders Henry. Victor suffers a mental breakdown, then returns home. Back in Geneva, Victor marries his childhood friendElizabeth Lavenza, only for the creature to murder her on the wedding night. Days later, Victor's father Alphonse dies of grief. With no remaining family, Victor vows revenge and pursues the creature, eventually following him to theArctic.

Chasing the creature across Arctic ice, Victor nearly dies from exhaustion andhypothermia. He is rescued by Captain Robert Walton, who is leading an expedition to the North Pole. Victor recounts his story to Walton and encourages the crew to continue their expedition; instead, they decide to abandon their journey and turn back. Victor vows to continue chasing the creature, but in his weakened state, he dies aboard the ship. As the ship leaves the Arctic, the creature comes onboard. He mourns Victor's death, tells Walton he plans to burn himself on a pyre, and then departs to build a pyre.

Mary Shelley's mother,Mary Wollstonecraft, died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her. Shelley grew close to her father,William Godwin, having never known her mother. Godwin hired a nurse, who briefly cared for her and her half sister, before marrying his second wifeMary Jane Clairmont, who did not like the close bond between Shelley and her father. The resulting friction caused Godwin to favour his other children.

Shelley's father was a famous author of the time, and her education was of great importance to him, although it was not formal. Shelley grew up surrounded by her father's friends, writers, and persons of political importance, who often gathered at the family home. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Mary, at the age of sixteen, met Percy Bysshe Shelley (who later became her husband) while he was visiting her father. Godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older, married man, so they fled to France along with her stepsister,Claire Clairmont. On 22 February 1815, Shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child, Clara, who died two weeks later.[10]

In thesummer of 1816, Mary, Percy, and Claire took a trip to visit Claire's lover, Lord Byron, inGeneva. Poor weather conditions, more akin to winter, forced Byron and the visitors to stay indoors. To help pass time, Byron suggested that he, Mary, Percy, and Byron's physician,John Polidori, have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors.[11]Mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation ofFrankenstein.[12][13]

Shelley's work was heavily influenced by that of her parents. Her father was famous forEnquiry Concerning Political Justiceand her mother famous forA Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Her father's novels also influenced her writing ofFrankenstein. These novels includedThings as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams,St. Leon, andFleetwood. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting inFrankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear inFrankensteinarePygmalionet Galatéeby Mme de Genlis, andOvid, with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society.[14]Ovid also inspires the use ofPrometheusin Shelley's title.[15]

The influence ofJohn Milton'sParadise LostandSamuel Taylor Coleridge'sThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerare evident in the novel. InThe Frankenstein of the French Revolution, author Julia Douthwaite posits that Shelley probably acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character fromHumphry Davy's bookElements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that,

References to theFrench Revolutionrun through the novel; a likely source isFrançois-Félix Nogaret[fr]'sLe Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant(1790), a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn, who creates a life-sized automaton.[16]

Both Frankenstein and the monster quote passages from Percy Shelley's 1816 poem, ""Mutability"", and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. Percy Shelley's name never appeared as the author of the poem, although the novel credits other quoted poets by name.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" (1798) is associated with the theme of guilt andWilliam Wordsworth's ""Tintern Abbey"" (1798) with that of innocence.

Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then-popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work because of several notable similarities. Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries wereGiovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London,[17]andJohann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

Ideas about life and death discussed by Percy and Byron were of great interest to scientists of that time. They discussed ideas fromErasmus Darwinand the experiments ofLuigi Galvanias well asJames Lind.[18]Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin, Galvani and perhaps Lind were present in her novel.

Shelley's personal experiences also influenced the themes withinFrankenstein. The themes of loss, guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance. In a 1965 issue ofThe Journal of Religion and Healtha psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.[13]

During the rainy summer of 1816, the ""Year Without a Summer"", the world was locked in a long, coldvolcanic wintercaused by the eruption ofMount Tamborain 1815.[19][20]Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and future husband),Percy Bysshe Shelley, visitedLord Byronat theVilla DiodatibyLake Geneva, in Switzerland'sAlps. The weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the bookFantasmagoriana.[21]Byron proposed that they ""each write a ghost story.""[22]Unable to think of a story, Mary Shelley became anxious. She recalled being asked ""Have you thought of a story?"" each morning, and every time being ""forced to reply with a mortifying negative.""[23]During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. ""Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated,"" Mary noted, ""galvanismhad given token of such things"".[24]It was after midnight before they retired and, unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the ""grim terrors"" of her ""waking dream"".[6]

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa in the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her ""waking dream"" took place between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.[26]

Mary Shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a fully-fledged novel.[27]She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment ""when I first stepped out from childhood into life.""[28]Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[29]This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composingFrankensteinin 1816, she was probably nursing her second child, who was also dead by the time ofFrankenstein's publication.[30]Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre ofBathin 1816.[31]

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on thevampirelegends he heard while travelling theBalkans, and from thisJohn PolidoricreatedThe Vampyre(1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.[32][33][34]

The group talked aboutEnlightenmentandCounter-Enlightenmentideas as well. Mary Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society.[35]

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as thefair copyfor her publisher, are now housed in theBodleian LibraryinOxford. The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004, and they belong now to theAbingerCollection.[36][37]In 2008, the Bodleian published a new edition ofFrankenstein, edited by Charles E. Robinson, that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley's original text with Percy Shelley's additions and interventions alongside.[38]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342,Pride and Prejudice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice,"In the early 19th century, theBennet familylives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton inHertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.

The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife"". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friendMr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance withElizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is ""not handsome enough"". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.

Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patronessLady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officerGeorge Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him unpleasantly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.

In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins inKent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the ""living"" his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerabledowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.

Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour ofDerbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visitPemberley, Darcy's estate, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Gardiner has paid Wickham. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted.











Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes ofPride and Prejudicebut Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initiallyFirst Impressions), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. ""After the success ofSense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.""

The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.""[8]The phrase ""pride and prejudice"" had been used over the preceding two centuries byJoseph Hall,Jeremy Taylor,Joseph AddisonandSamuel Johnson.[9][10]Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage inFanny Burney'sCecilia(1782), a novel she is known to have admired:

A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[12]Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. InPride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing.[12]Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[13]

The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1513,Romeo and Juliet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet,"The play, set inVerona,Italy, begins with a street brawl betweenMontagueandCapuletservants who, like the masters they serve, are sworn enemies.Prince Escalus of Veronaintervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later,Count Paristalks to Capulet about marrying his daughterJuliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capuletball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's Nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship.

Meanwhile,Benvoliotalks with his cousinRomeo, Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl namedRosaline, one of Capulet's nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio andMercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. Juliet's cousin,Tybalt, is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball but is stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet's father, who does not wish to shed blood in his house. After the ball, in what is now famously known as the ""balcony scene,"" Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her, and they agree to be married. With the help ofFriar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, they are secretly married the next day.

Tybalt, meanwhile, still incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight. Mercutio is offended by Tybalt's insolence, as well as Romeo's ""vile submission"",[1]and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo attempts to break up the fight, and declares a curse upon both households before he dies. (""A plague on both your houses!"") Grief-stricken and racked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt.

Montague argues that Romeo has justly executed Tybalt for the murder of Mercutio. The Prince, now having lost a kinsman in the warring families' feud, exiles Romeo from Verona, under penalty of death if he ever returns. Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet's chamber, where theyconsummatetheir marriage. Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet's grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris's ""joyful bride"".[2]When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her.

Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a potion that will put her into a deathlike coma orcatalepsyfor ""two and forty hours"".[3]The Friar promises to send a messenger, Friar John, to inform Romeo of the plan so that he can rejoin her when she awakens.  On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the familycrypt.

Friar John, however, is unable to deliver the message about Juliet to Romeo because the onset of a plague makes travel impossible. Instead, Romeo learns of Juliet's apparent death from his servant, Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from anapothecaryand goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, discovering that Romeo is dead, stabs herself with his dagger and joins him in death. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two ""star-cross'd lovers"", fulfilling the curse that Mercutio swore. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince's elegy for the lovers: ""For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.""[4]

Romeo and Julietborrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these isPyramus and Thisbe, fromOvid'sMetamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.[5]TheEphesiacaofXenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep.[6]

One of the earliest references to the namesMontagueandCapuletis fromDante'sDivine Comedy, who mentions the Montecchi (Montagues) and the Cappelletti (Capulets) in canto six ofPurgatorio:[7]

However, the reference is part of a polemic against what Dante saw as moral decay ofFlorence,Lombardy, and theItalian statesin general; through his characters, Dante aimed to chastiseAlbert I of Germanyfor neglecting what Dante felt were his responsibilities towards Italy (""you who are negligent"") as ""King of the Romans"", as well as successivepopesfor their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare betweenrival political partiesin Lombardy. History records the name of the familyMontagueas being lent to such a political party inVerona, but that of theCapuletsas from aCremonesefamily, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona.[9]Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving (""One lot already grieving"") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties,[9]rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.

The earliest known version of theRomeo and Juliettale akin to Shakespeare's play is the story of Mariotto and Ganozza byMasuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of hisIl Novellinopublished in 1476.[10]Salernitano sets the story inSienaand insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His version of the story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Ganozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Ganozza dies of grief.[11][12]

Luigi da Porto(1485–1529) adapted the story asGiulietta e Romeo[13]and included it in hisHistoria novellamente ritrovata di due nobili amanti(A Newly-Discovered History of two Noble Lovers), written in 1524 and published posthumously in 1531 in Venice.[14][15]Da Porto drew onPyramus and Thisbe,Boccaccio'sDecameron, and Salernitano'sMariotto e Ganozza, but it is likely that his story is also autobiographical:  He was a soldier present at a ball on 26 February 1511, at a residence of the pro-VeniceSavorgnan clan inUdine, following a peace ceremony attended by the opposing pro-ImperialStrumieri clan.  There, Da Porto fell in love with Lucina, a Savorgnan daughter, but the family feud frustrated their courtship. The next morning,the Savorgnans led an attack on the city, and many members of the Strumieri were murdered. Years later, still half-paralyzed from a battle-wound, Luigi wroteGiulietta e RomeoinMontorso Vicentino(from which he could see the ""castles"" of Verona), dedicating thenovellato thebellisima e leggiadra(the beautiful and graceful) Lucina Savorgnan.[13][16]Da Porto presented his tale as historically factual and claimed it took place at least a century earlier than Salernitano had it, in the days Verona was ruled by Bartolomeo della Scala[17](anglicized asPrince Escalus).

Da Porto presented the narrative in close to its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti (Cappelletti) and the location in Verona.[10]He named thefriar Laurence(frate Lorenzo) and introduced the charactersMercutio(Marcuccio Guertio),Tybalt(Tebaldo Cappelletti),Count Paris(conte (Paride) diLodrone), the faithful servant, andGiulietta's nurse. Da Porto originated the remaining basic elements of the story: the feuding families, Romeo—left by his mistress—meeting Giulietta at a dance at her house, the love scenes (including the balcony scene), the periods of despair, Romeo killing Giulietta's cousin (Tebaldo), and the families' reconciliation after the lovers' suicides.[18]In da Porto's version, Romeo takes poison and Giulietta keeps her breath until she dies.[19]

In 1554,Matteo Bandellopublished the second volume of hisNovelle, which included his version ofGiulietta e Romeo,[15]probably written between 1531 and 1545.  Bandello lengthened and weighed down the plot while leaving the storyline basically unchanged (though he did introduceBenvolio).[18]Bandello's story was translated into French byPierre Boaistuauin 1559 in the first volume of hisHistoires Tragiques. Boaistuau adds much moralising and sentiment, and the characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts.[20]

In his 1562narrative poemThe Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer'sTroilus and Criseyde.[21]There was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on Italiannovelle—Italian tales were very popular among theatre-goers—and Shakespeare may well have been familiar withWilliam Painter's 1567 collection of Italian tales titledPalace of Pleasure.[22]This collection included a version in prose of theRomeo and Julietstory named""The goodly History of the true and constant love of Romeo and Juliett"". Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity:The Merchant of Venice,Much Ado About Nothing,All's Well That Ends Well,Measure for Measure, andRomeo and Julietare all from Italiannovelle.Romeo and Julietis a dramatization of Brooke's translation, and Shakespeare follows the poem closely but adds detail to several major and minor characters (the Nurse and Mercutio in particular).[23][24][25]

Christopher Marlowe'sHero and LeanderandDido, Queen of Carthage, both similar stories written in Shakespeare's day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.[21]

It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wroteRomeo and Juliet. Juliet's Nurse refers to an earthquake she says occurred 11 years ago.[26]This may refer to theDover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed in support of the different dates.[27]But the play's stylistic similarities withA Midsummer Night's Dreamand other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595.[28][b]One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.[29]

Shakespeare'sRomeo and Julietwas published in twoquartoeditions prior to the publication of theFirst Folioof 1623. These are referred to as Q1 and Q2. The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a so-called 'bad quarto'; the 20th-century editor T. J. B. Spencer described it as ""a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors"", suggesting that it had been pirated for publication.[30]An alternative explanation for Q1's shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company.[31]However, ""the theory, formulated by [Alfred] Pollard,"" that the 'bad quarto' was reconstructed from memory by some of the actors is now under attack. Alternative theories are that some or all of 'the bad quartos' are early versions by Shakespeare or abbreviations made either for Shakespeare's company or for other companies.""[32]In any event, its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 the latest possible date for the play's composition.[27]

The superior Q2 called the playThe Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet. It was printed in 1599 byThomas Creedeand published byCuthbert Burby. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1.[31]Its title page describes it as ""Newly corrected, augmented and amended"". Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft (called hisfoul papers) since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and ""false starts"" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).[30]In effect, all later Quartos and Folios ofRomeo and Julietare based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to have arisen from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.[31]

The First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1.[30][33]Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4).[34]Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared withNicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed byAlexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into theRomanticperiod. Fully annotated editions first appeared in theVictorian periodand continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.[35]

Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, overarchingthemeto the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike,[36]awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.[37]

Romeo and Julietis sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love.[36]Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.[39]

On their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor. By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended byBaldassare Castiglione(whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand him, and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious metaphors of ""shrine"", ""pilgrim"", and ""saint"" were fashionable in the poetry of the time and more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age.[40]Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ's resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke'sRomeus and Juliet.[41]

In the later balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's soliloquy, but in Brooke's version of the story, her declaration is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to be modest and shy to make sure that her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip courting and move on to plain talk about their relationship—agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night.[39]In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message—in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to Hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the ""Religion of Love"" are joined with their loves in Paradise. Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the ""Religion of Love"" view rather than the Catholic view. Another point is that, although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which keeps them from losing the audience's sympathy.[42]

The play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasise aboutit as a dark being, often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet's (faked) death, describes it as havingdefloweredhis daughter.[43]Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death. Right before her suicide, she grabs Romeo's dagger, saying ""O happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.""[44][45]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland,"Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots aWhite Rabbitwith apocket watchandwaistcoatlamenting that he is late. Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing. Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden. While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled ""Drink me"". Alice drinks some of the bottle's contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door. However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it. Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled ""Eat me"", which causes her to grow to a tremendous size. Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves. Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears. Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a ""Caucus Race"" to dry themselves. Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.

The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan. Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them. Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house. Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes. Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest. She meets aCaterpillarseated on a mushroom and smoking ahookah. During the Caterpillar's questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded byher inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice's neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of aDuchess, who owns a perpetually grinningCheshire Cat. The Duchess's baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods. The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward theHatterandMarch Harebefore disappearing, leaving his grin behind. Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepyDormousein the midst of atea party. The Hatter explains that it is always 6 p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to ""kill it"". A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing desk?"" is brought up. Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.

Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey. She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be thecroquetcourt of theQueen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards. Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops. The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings. When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter. When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.

Alice then meets aGryphonand aMock Turtle, who dance to theLobster Quadrillewhile Alice recites (rather incorrectly)a poem. The Mock Turtle sings them ""Beautiful Soup"", during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which theKnave of Heartsstands accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The trial is conducted by theKing of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met. Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice's beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen's guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2542,A Doll's House : a play,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll%27s_House,"The play opens around Christmas time as Nora Helmer enters her home carrying many packages and presents. Nora's husband, Torvald, is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his ""little squirrel"". He teases her about how, the previous year, she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. This year, Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to travel to Italy so he could recover. Kristine explains that, when her mother was ill, she had to take care of her brothers, but, now that they are grown, she feels her life is ""unspeakably empty"". Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she tells her that she got money from ""some admirer"" so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health.  She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but, in fact, she illegally borrowed it without his knowledge (women were forbidden from conducting financial activities such as signing checks without a man's endorsement). Since then, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay off the loan.

Krogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is ""morally diseased"".

After the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children, and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps through the ajar door into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him from the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad blackmails her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature after his death. Krogstad leaves, and, when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that, years before, he had committed a crime: he forged other people's signatures. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man ""poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation"".

Kristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is too familiar around Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.

Dr. Rank then arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of his disease and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She then clumsily attempts to tell him that she is not in love with him but loves him dearly as a friend.

Having been fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan but that he will instead preserve the associatedbondto blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature ofsuretyon the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.

Nora tells Kristine of her difficult situation, gives her Krogstad's card with his address, and asks her to try to convince him to relent.

Torvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself.

Kristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter from Torvald. Kristine, however, decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.

After Torvald literally drags Nora home from the party, Rank follows them. They chat for a while, with Dr. Rank conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora prepares to run away for good, but Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that she is now completely in Krogstad's power; she must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.

A maid enters, delivering a letter from Krogstad to Nora, which Torvald demands to read himself. Torvald then exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was and that he truly loves himself more than he does Nora.

Torvald explains that, when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.

Nora tells Torvald that she is leaving him and, in a confrontational scene, expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment. She says he has never loved her and they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.

Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring; Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened. After Nora leaves the room, Torvald, for one second, still has a sense of hope and exclaims to himself ""The most wonderful thing of all—?"", just before the door downstairs is heard closing.

Ibsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theaters. In addition, copyright laws of the time would not preserve Ibsen's original work. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, and prevent the translator from altering his work, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and as the curtain is brought down, it is implied that she stays. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a ""barbaric outrage"".[9]Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all the film versions of the play.

A Doll's Housewas based on the life ofLaura Kieler(maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband's life—in this case, to find a cure for his tuberculosis.[10]She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point, she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.

Ibsen wroteA Doll's Housewhen Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum. The fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.

Kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as ""Ibsen's Nora"" years afterward.[11][12]

Ibsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualized itsprotagonist, Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing ""a blue woolen dress"").[13]He outlined his conception of the play as a ""moderntragedy"" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878.[14]""A woman cannot be herself in modern society"", he argues, since it is ""an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint!""[15]

Ibsen sent afair copyof the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879.[16]It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.[17]

A Doll's Housereceived its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at theRoyal Danish Theatrein Copenhagen, withBetty Henningsas Nora,Emil Poulsenas Torvald, andPeter Jerndorffas Dr. Rank.[18]Writing for the Norwegian newspaperFolkets Avis, the criticErik Bøghadmired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: ""Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear.""[19]Every performance of its run was sold out.[20]Another production opened at theRoyal Dramatic Theatrein Stockholm, on 8 January 1880, while productions inChristiania(with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) andBergenfollowed shortly after.[21]

In Germany, the actressHedwig Raaberefused to perform the play as written, declaring, ""Iwould never leavemychildren!""[20]Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a ""barbaric outrage"" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave.[22][23]A production of this version opened inFlensburgin February 1880.[24]This version was also played inHamburg,Dresden,Hanover, andBerlin, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Raabe eventually restored the original ending.[24]Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at theResidence TheatreinMunich.[24]

InGreat Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given inLondonwas in an adaptation byHenry Arthur JonesandHenry HermancalledBreaking a Butterfly.[25]This adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre on 3 March 1884. Writing in 1896 in his bookThe Foundations of a National Drama, Jones says: ""A rough translation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands, and I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen, but I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances came the adaptation calledBreaking a Butterfly.""[26]H. L. Menckenwrites that it wasA Doll's House""denaturized anddephlogisticated. [...] Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immorality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstad's desk. [...] The curtain fell upon a happy home.""[27]

Before 1889, there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it). In 1886, the first production in England took place atEleanor Marx's lodgings in London and featured her as Nora and her friendGeorge Bernard Shawin the role of Krogstad; both were champions of Ibsen.[8]The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at theNovelty Theatre, starringJanet Achurchas Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald.[28][29][30]Achurch played Nora again for a seven-day run in 1897. Soon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play toAustraliain 1889.[31]

The play was first seen in theUSin 1883 inLouisville, Kentucky;Helena Modjeskaacted Nora.[29]The play made itsBroadwaypremiere at thePalmer's Theatreon 21 December 1889, starringBeatrice Cameronas Nora Helmer.[32]It was first performed inFrancein 1894.[21]Other productions in the US include one in 1902 starringMinnie Maddern Fiske, a 1937 adaptation with acting script byThornton Wilderand starringRuth Gordon, a 1971 production starringClaire Bloom, and a 1997 production starringJanet McTeer.

A new translation byZinnie Harrisat theDonmar Warehouse, starringGillian Anderson,Toby Stephens,Anton Lesser,Tara FitzGeraldandChristopher Ecclestonopened in May 2009.[33]

The play was performed by24/6: A Jewish Theater Companyin March 2011, one of their early performances following their December 2010Lower Manhattanlaunch.[34]

In August 2013,Young Vic[35]produced a new adaptation[36]ofA Doll's Housedirected by Carrie Cracknell[37]based on the English language version by Simon Stephens. In September 2014, in partnership withBrisbane Festival,La Boite Theatre Companylocated inBrisbane, Australia, hosted an adaptation ofA Doll's Housewritten byLally Katzand directed by Stephen Mitchell Wright.[38]In June 2015, Space Arts Centre in London staged an adaptation ofA Doll's Housefeaturing the discarded alternate ending.[39]'Manaveli'Torontostaged aTamilversion ofA Doll's House(ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு) on 30 June 2018, translated and directed by Mr P Vikneswaran. The drama was very well received by theTamil community in Torontoand was staged again a few months later. The same stage play was filmed at the beginning of 2019 and screened in Toronto on 4 May 2019. The film was received with very good reviews, and the artists were hailed for their performance. Arrangements were made to screen the film in London, at Safari Cinema Harrow, on 7 July 2019.[39]From September 2019 to October 2019, the Lyric Hammersmith in London hosted a new adaptation of the play by Tanika Gupta who moved the setting of the play tocolonial India.[40]Though the plot largely remained unchanged, the protagonists were renamed Tom and Niru Helmer and a conversation was added regarding the British oppression of the Indian public. One significant shift was the lack of a slamming door at the end of the play. They also published a pack of teaching materials which includes extracts from the adapted play script.[41]

A production ofA Doll's HousebyThe Jamie Lloyd CompanystarringJessica Chastainwas scheduled to play at thePlayhouse Theatrein London in mid-2020. Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the play was postponed to a later date.[42]In November 2022, it was announced that the production would instead premiere on Broadway at theHudson Theatre. It began previews on 13 February 2023 and officially opened on 9 March, running until 10 June.[43]It starred Chastain,Arian Moayed,Michael Patrick Thornton, andOkieriete Onaodowan.[44]

A Doll's Housequestions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage.[22]To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. The covenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as Ibsen did was controversial.[45]The Irish playwrightGeorge Bernard Shaw, however, found Ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.[46]

The Swedish playwrightAugust Strindbergcriticised the play in his volume of essays and short storiesGetting Married(1884).[47]Strindberg questioned Nora's walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Nora's involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a signature, all done behind her husband's back, and then Nora's lying to her husband regarding Krogstad's blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her husband. Strindberg also points out that Nora's complaint that she and Torvald ""have never exchanged one serious word about serious things"" is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.[48]

The reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play. In the last scene, she tells her husband she has been ""greatly wronged"" by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage—as though she were his ""doll wife""—and the children in turn have become her ""dolls"", leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. She is troubled by her husband's behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money. She does not love her husband, feels completely confused and that they are strangers, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. George Bernard Shaw suggests that she left to begin ""a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life"" and that her revolt is ""the end of a chapter of human history"".[8][49][3]

Michael Meyerargued that the play's theme is notwomen's rightsbut rather ""the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person"".[50]In a speech given to theNorwegian Association for Women's Rightsin 1898, Ibsen insisted that he ""must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement"" since he wrote ""without any conscious thought of making propaganda"", his task having been ""thedescription of humanity"".[51]The play, however, is associated with feminism, as Miriam Schneir includes it in her anthologyFeminism: The Essential Historical Writings, labeling it as one of the essential feminist works.[52]

Because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself.[53][54]InIconoclasts(1905),James Hunekernoted ""That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world.""[55]Chinese writerLu Xunevaluated the ending in the 1923 speech,What happens after Nora leaves home, in which he compares Nora's lack of economic independence to China's political and economic repression.

Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have a sickly friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can ""visit"" whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.[2]

Gwendolen and her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, now call on Algernon, who distracts Lady Bracknell in another room while Jack proposes to Gwendolen. She accepts but says she could not love him if his name were not Ernest. He resolves secretly to be rechristened. Discovering the two in this intimate exchange, Lady Bracknell interviews Jack as a prospective suitor for her daughter. Horrified to learn that he was adopted – having been found as a baby in a handbag deposited atVictoria Stationin London – she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter. Gwendolen manages to covertly promise to him her undying love. As Jack gives her his address in the country, Algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve: Jack's revelation of his pretty young ward has motivated his friend to meet her.[3]

The Garden of the Manor House, Woolton

Cecily is studying with her governess, Miss Prism, in the (fictitious) village of Woolton, Hertfordshire. Algernon arrives, pretending to be Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by her uncle Jack's hitherto-absent dissolute brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest. Algernon plans for therector, Dr Chasuble, to rechristen him ""Ernest"". Jack has decided to abandon his double life. He arrives in full mourning and announces his brother's death in Paris, from a severe chill, a story undermined by Algernon's presence in the guise of Ernest. Gwendolen now enters, having left the Bracknells' London house without her mother's knowledge. During the temporary absence of the two men she meets Cecily. They get along well at first, but when they learn of the other's engagement each indignantly declares that she is the one engaged to Ernest. When Jack and Algernon reappear together, Gwendolen and Cecily realise they have been deceived; they leave the men in the garden and withdraw to the house.[4]

Morning-room at the Manor House, Woolton

Gwendolen and Cecily forgive the men's trickery. Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of Cecily's wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell's initial doubts over the young lady's suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by herguardian, Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen – something she declines to do.

The impasse is resolved by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell recognises as the person who, 28 years earlier as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy out in aperambulatorfrom Lord Bracknell's house and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absent-mindedly put into the perambulator the manuscript of a novel she was writing, and put the baby in a handbag, which she later left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the eldest son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, Mrs Moncrieff, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as Gwendolen's suitor.[5]

Gwendolen continues to insist that she can love only a man named Ernest. Lady Bracknell tells Jack that, as the firstborn, he would have been named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack examines theArmy Listsand discovers that his father's name – and hence his own original christening name – was, in fact, Ernest. As the happy couples embrace – Ernest and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism – Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: ""My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality"". He replies, ""On the contrary, Aunt Augusta: I've now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest"".[6]

The Importance of Being Earnestfollowed the success of Wilde's earlierdrawing room plays,Lady Windermere's Fan(1892),A Woman of No Importance(1893)  andAn Ideal Husband(1895).[7]He spent the summer of 1894 with his family atWorthing, on theSussexcoast, where he began work on the new play.[8]

Wilde scholars generally agree that the most important influence on the play wasW. S. Gilbert's 1877farceEngaged,[9]from which Wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also, in the words of Russell Jackson in his 1980 introduction to Wilde's play, ""the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors"".[10]Wilde's first draft was so long that it filled fourexercise books, and over the summer he continually revised and refined it, as he had done with his earlier plays.[11][12]Among his many changes he altered the subtitle from ""a Serious Comedy for Trivial People"" to ""a Trivial Comedy for Serious People"",[13]and renamed the characters Lady Brancaster and Algernon Montford as Lady Bracknell and Algernon Moncrieff.[14]

Wilde wrote the part of John Worthing with the actor-managerCharles Wyndhamin mind. Wilde sharedBernard Shaw'sview that Wyndham was the ideal comedy actor and based the character on his stage persona.[7]Wyndham accepted the play for production athis theatre, but before rehearsals began, he changed his plans in order to help a beleaguered colleague, the actor-managerGeorge Alexanderof theSt James's Theatre. In early 1895 Alexander's production ofHenry James'sGuy Domvillefailed, and closed after 31 performances, leaving Alexander in urgent need of a new play to follow it.[15][16]Wyndham waived his contractual rights and allowed Alexander to stage Wilde's play.[16][17]

After working with Wilde on stage movements, using a model theatre, Alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde complied and combined elements of the second and third acts.[18]The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to serve awriton the profligate ""Ernest"" Worthing for unpaid dining bills at theSavoy Hotel.[11][19]Wilde was not entirely happy with alterations made at Alexander's behest. He said, ""Yes, it is quite a good play. I remember I wrote one very like it myself, but it was even more brilliant than this"",[18]but the three-act version usually performed is widely considered more effective than Wilde's four-act original.[20][21][n 1]

The play was first produced at the St James's Theatre, London, on 14 February –Valentine's Day– 1895,[22]preceded by acurtain-raiser, a short comedy calledIn the Season, byLangdon E. Mitchell.[23]During most of the month-long rehearsal period Wilde was on holiday in Algeria with his gay partner,Lord Alfred Douglas, but he returned in time for thedress rehearsalon 12 February.[24]Douglas remained in Algiers; his father, theMarquess of Queensberry, planned to disrupt the premiere by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end. Wilde learned of the plan and Alexander cancelled Queensberry's ticket and arranged for the police to bar his entrance. Wilde wrote to Douglas, ""He arrived with aprize fighter!![n 2]I had allScotland Yardto guard the theatre. He prowled around for three hours, then left chattering like a monstrous ape"".[26]Queensberry left the bouquet at the theatre entrance.[25]

Wilde arrived for the premiere dressed in ""florid sobriety"", wearing agreen carnationin his lapel.[27]Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled toHesketh Pearson:

The theatrical newspaperThe Erareported that the play ""met with enthusiastic and unanimous approval"" and confidently predicted ""a long and prosperous run"".[23]Aynesworth was ""debonair and stylish"", and Alexander, who played Jack Worthing, ""demure"";[29]according toThe Era, ""Mr George Alexander played Worthing just as a part of this sort should be played, i.e., with entire seriousness and no indication of purposed irony"".[23]The Morning Postsaid thatIrene VanbrughandEvelyn Millardcould not be bettered and caught the required Gilbertian tone.[30]The Observerremarked on the ""rapturous amusement"" of the audience, and echoedThe Era's prediction of a long run.[31]

According to the published text, the characters, descriptions and cast comprised:[32][1]

Queensberry continued harassing Wilde, who within weeks launched aprivate prosecutionagainst him forcriminal libel, triggering aseries of trialsthat revealed Wilde's homosexual private life and ended in his imprisonment forgross indecencyin May 1895. TheVictorianpublic turned against him after his arrest, and box-office receipts dwindled rapidly;[34][35]Alexander tried to save the production by removing the author's name from the playbills,[n 4]but it closed on 8 May after only 83 performances.[24][37]

The play's originalBroadwayproduction opened at theEmpire Theatreon 22 April 1895 but closed after sixteen performances. Its cast includedWilliam Favershamas Algernon,Henry Milleras Jack,Viola Allenas Gwendolen and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell.[38]The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented byRobert BroughandDion Boucicault Jr., with Cecil Ward as Jack, Boucicault as Algernon and Jenny Watt-Tanner as Lady Bracknell. The production was an immediate success.[39][40]Wilde's downfall in England did not affect the popularity of his plays in Australia.[41][n 5]The same company presented the New Zealand premiere in October 1895, when the play was enthusiastically received. Reviewers said, ""in subtlety of thought, brilliancy of wit and sparkling humour, it has scarcely been excelled"";[42]and ""its fun is irresistible ... increasing in intensity until in the third and last act it becomes uproarious"".[43]

In contrast with much theatre of the time, the light plot ofThe Importance of Being Earnestdoes not address serious social and political issues,  and this troubled some contemporary reviewers. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity.[44]Shaw found the play ""extremely funny"" but ""heartless"", a view he maintained all his life.[45][n 6]His review in theSaturday Reviewargued that comedy should touch as well as amuse: ""I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter, not to be tickled or bustled into it"".[47]

InThe World,William Archerwrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: ""What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?""[48]InThe Speaker,A. B. Walkleyadmired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied that the term ""farce"" was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said, ""It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen"".[49]

H. G. Wells, in an unsigned review forThe Pall Mall Gazette, called the play one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying, ""More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine"".[50]He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, ""... how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously"".[50]The play was so light-hearted that some reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama.W. H. Audenlater (1963) called it ""a pure verbal opera"", andThe Timescommented, ""The story is almost too preposterous to go without music"".[29]Mary McCarthy, inSights and Spectacles(1959), despite thinking the play extremely funny, called it ""a ferocious idyll""; ""depravity is the hero and the only character"".[51]

As Wilde's works came to be read and performed again in the early 20th century, it wasThe Importance of Being Earnestthat received the most productions.[52]The critic and authorMax Beerbohmcalled the play Wilde's ""finest, most undeniably his own"", saying that the plots of his other comedies –Lady Windermere's Fan,A Woman of No ImportanceandAn Ideal Husband– follow the manner ofVictorien Sardou,[n 7]and are similarly unrelated to the theme of the work, while inThe Importance of Being Earnestthe story is ""dissolved"" into the form of the play.[54]By the time of its centenary in 1995 the journalistMark Lawsondescribed the piece as ""the second most known and quoted play in English afterHamlet"".[55]

The Importance of Being Earnestand Wilde's three other drawing room plays were performed in Britain during the author's imprisonment and exile by small touring groups. A. B. Tapping's company touredThe Importancebetween October 1895 and March 1896,[n 8]and Elsie Lanham's touring company presented it along withLady Windermere's Fan, beginning in November 1899.[57]The play was well received; one local critic described it as ""sparkling with wit and epigrams"",[58]and another called it ""a most entertaining comedy [with] some sparkling dialogue"".[59]

The play was not seen again in London until after Wilde's death in 1900. Alexander revived it in the small Coronet theatre inNotting Hill, outside the West End, in December the following year,[60]after taking it on tour, starring as John Worthing, with a cast that included the youngLilian Braithwaiteas Cecily.The Manchester Guardiancalled the piece ""a brilliant play"".[61]The Importance of Being Earnestreturned to the West End when Alexander presented a revival at the St James's in 1902. It was billed as ""By the author ofLady Windermere's Fan"", and few reviews mentioned Wilde's name, but his work was praised.The Sporting Timessaid:"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/145,Middlemarch,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlemarch,"Middlemarchcentres on the lives of residents of Middlemarch, a fictitious Midlands town, from 1829 onwards – the years up to the1832 Reform Act. The narrative may be considered to consist of four plots with unequal emphasis:[17]the life of Dorothea Brooke, the career of Tertius Lydgate, the courtship of Mary Garth by Fred Vincy, and the disgrace of Nicholas Bulstrode. The two main plots are those of Dorothea and Lydgate.[18]Each plot occurs concurrently, although Bulstrode's is centred on the later chapters.[19]

Dorothea Brooke is a 19-year-old orphan, living with her younger sister, Celia, as a ward of her uncle, Mr Brooke. Dorothea is an especially pious young woman whose hobby involves the renovation of buildings belonging to the tenant farmers, although her uncle discourages her. Dorothea is courted by Sir James Chettam, a man close to her own age, but she is oblivious to him. She is attracted instead to the Rev. Edward Casaubon, a 45-year-old scholar. Dorothea accepts Casaubon's offer of marriage, despite her sister's misgivings. Chettam is encouraged to turn his attention to Celia, who has developed an interest in him.

Fred and Rosamond Vincy are the eldest children of Middlemarch's town mayor. Having never finished university, Fred is widely seen as a failure and a layabout, but is content because he is the presumed heir of his childless uncle Mr Featherstone, a rich but unpleasant man. Featherstone keeps as a companion a niece of his by marriage, Mary Garth; although she is considered plain, Fred is in love with her and wants to marry her.

Dorothea and Casaubon experience the first tensions in their marriage on their honeymoon in Rome, when Dorothea finds that her husband has no interest in involving her in his intellectual pursuits. She meets Will Ladislaw, Casaubon's much younger disinherited cousin, whom he supports financially. Ladislaw begins to feel attracted to Dorothea; she remains oblivious, but the two become friendly.

Fred becomes deeply in debt and finds himself unable to repay what he owes. Having asked Mr Garth, Mary's father, to co-sign the debt, he now tells Garth he must forfeit it. As a result, Mrs Garth's savings from four years of income, held in reserve for the education of one of her sons, are wiped out, as are Mary's savings. Mr Garth consequently warns Mary against ever marrying Fred.

Fred comes down with typhoid fever and is treated by Dr Tertius Lydgate, a newly-arrived doctor in Middlemarch. Lydgate has modern ideas about medicine and sanitation which draw the ire and criticism of many in town. He allies himself with Bulstrode, a wealthy, church-going landowner and developer who wants to build a hospital and clinic that follow Lydgate's philosophy, despite the misgivings of Lydgate's friend, the Rev. Farebrother, about Bulstrode's integrity. Lydgate also becomes acquainted with Rosamond Vincy, who is beautiful and educated, but shallow and self-absorbed. Seeking to make a good match, she decides to marry Lydgate, who comes from a wealthy family, and uses Fred's sickness as an opportunity to get close to him. Lydgate initially views their relationship as pure flirtation and backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, on seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution, and the two become engaged.

Casaubon arrives back from Rome about the same time, but suffers a heart attack. Lydgate attends him and tells Dorothea it is difficult to pronounce on the nature of Casaubon's illness and chances of recovery: that he may indeed live about 15 years if he takes it easy and ceases his studies, but it is equally possible the disease may develop rapidly, in which case death will be sudden. As Fred recovers, Mr Featherstone falls ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has made two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be involved in the business, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with both wills still intact. Featherstone's plan had been for £10,000 to go to Fred Vincy, but his estate and fortune instead go to his illegitimate son, Joshua Rigg.

Casaubon, in poor health, has grown suspicious of Dorothea's goodwill to Ladislaw. He tries to make Dorothea promise, if he should die, to forever ""avoid doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire"". She hesitates to make a promise without knowing what it would entail, and he dies before she can reply. Casaubon's will is revealed to contain a provision that, if Dorothea marries Ladislaw, she will lose her inheritance. This proviso leads to the general suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is in love with Dorothea but keeps this secret, having no desire to involve her in scandal or cause her disinheritance. She realizes she has romantic feelings for him, but must suppress them. He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke, who is mounting a campaign to run forParliamenton aReformplatform.

Lydgate's efforts to please Rosamond soon leave him deeply in debt, and he is forced to seek help from Bulstrode. Meanwhile, Fred Vincy's humiliation at being responsible for Caleb Garth's financial setbacks shocks him into reassessing his life. He resolves to train as aland agentunder the forgiving Caleb. He asks the Rev. Farebrother to plead his case to Mary Garth, not realizing that Farebrother is also in love with her. Farebrother does speak to her, thereby sacrificing his own desires for the sake of Mary, who he realises truly loves Fred and is just waiting for Fred to find his place in the world.

John Raffles, a mysterious man who knows of Bulstrode's shady past, appears in Middlemarch, intending to blackmail him. In his youth, the church-going Bulstrode engaged in questionable financial dealings; his fortune is founded on his marriage to a wealthy, much older widow. The widow's daughter, who should have inherited her mother's fortune, had run away; Bulstrode located her but did not tell the widow, so that he, instead of her daughter, inherited the fortune. The widow's daughter had a son, who turns out to be Ladislaw. On grasping their connection, Bulstrode is consumed with guilt and offers Ladislaw a large sum of money, which Ladislaw refuses as being tainted. Bulstrode's terror of public exposure as a hypocrite leads him to hasten the death of the mortally sick Raffles, while lending a large sum to Lydgate, whom Bulstrode had previously refused to bail out of his debt. However, the story of Bulstrode's misdeeds has already spread. Bulstrode's disgrace engulfs Lydgate: knowledge of the loan spreads and he is assumed to be complicit with Bulstrode. Only Dorothea and Farebrother retain any faith in him, yet the widespread condemnation still drives Lydgate and Rosamond to leave Middlemarch. Disgraced and reviled, Bulstrode's one consolation is that his wife stands by him as he too faces exile.

When Mr Brooke's election campaign collapses, Ladislaw decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea to say his farewell, but Dorothea has fallen in love with him. She renounces Casaubon's fortune and shocks her family by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, having been successful in his new career, marries Mary.

The ""Finale"" details the ultimate fortunes of the main characters. Fred and Mary marry and live contentedly with their three sons. Lydgate operates a successful practice outside Middlemarch and attains a good income, but never finds fulfilment and dies at the age of 50, leaving Rosamond and four children. After he dies, Rosamond marries a wealthy physician. Ladislaw engages in public reform, and Dorothea is content as a wife and mother to their two children. Their son eventually inherits Arthur Brooke's estate.

The action ofMiddlemarchtakes place ""between September 1829 and May 1832"", or 40 years before its publication in 1871–1872,[2]a gap not so pronounced for it to be regularly labelled as ahistorical novel. By comparison,Walter Scott'sWaverley(1814) – often seen as the first major historical novel – takes place some 60 years before it appears.[2]Eliot had previously written a more obviously historical novel,Romola(1862–1863), set in 15th-centuryFlorence. The critics Kathleen Blake and Michael York Mason argue that there has been insufficient attention given toMiddlemarch""as a historical novel that evokes the past in relation to the present"".[20]

The critic Rosemary Ashton notes that the lack of attention to this side of the novel may indicate its merits: ""Middlemarchis that very rare thing, a successful historical novel. In fact, it is so successful that we scarcely think of it in terms of that subgenre of fiction.""[2]For its contemporary readers, the present ""was the passage of theSecond Reform Actin 1867"";[21]the agitation for theReform Act 1832and its turbulent passage through the twoHouses of Parliament, which provide the structure of the novel, would have been seen as the past.[20]

Though rarely categorised as a historical novel,Middlemarch's attention to historical detail has been noticed; in an 1873 review,Henry Jamesrecognised that Eliot's ""purpose was to be a generous rural historian"".[22]Elsewhere, Eliot has been seen to adopt ""the role of imaginative historian, even scientific investigator inMiddlemarchand her narrator as conscious ""of the historiographical questions involved in writing a social and political history of provincial life"". This critic compares the novel to ""a work of the ancient Greek historianHerodotus"", who is often described as ""The Father of History"".[2]

The fictional town of Middlemarch, North Loamshire, is probably based onCoventry, where Eliot had lived before moving to London. Like Coventry, Middlemarch is described as a silk-ribbon manufacturing town.[2][23]

The subtitle—""A Study of Provincial Life""—has been seen as significant. One critic views the unity ofMiddlemarchas achieved through ""the fusion of the two senses of 'provincial'"":[23]on the one hand it means geographically ""all parts of the country except the capital""; and on the other, a person who is ""unsophisticated"" or ""narrow-minded"".[24]Carolyn Steedman links Eliot's emphasis on provincialism inMiddlemarchtoMatthew Arnold's discussion ofsocial classin England inCulture and Anarchyessays, published in 1869, about the time Eliot began working on the stories that becameMiddlemarch. There Arnold classes British society in terms of Barbarians (aristocrats and landed gentry), Philistines (urban middle class) and Populace (working class). Steedman suggestsMiddlemarch""is a portrait ofPhilistine Provincialism"".[2]

It is worth noting that Eliot went to London, as her heroine Dorothea does at the end of the book. There Eliot achieved fame way beyond most women of her time, whereas Dorothea takes on the role of nurturing Will and her family. Eliot was rejected by her family once she had settled in her common-law relationship with Lewes, and ""their profound disapproval prevented her ever going home again"". She omitted Coventry from her last visit tothe Midlandsin 1855.[2]

Central toMiddlemarchis the idea that Dorothea Brooke cannot hope to achieve the heroic stature of a figure likeSaint Teresa, for Eliot's heroine lives at the wrong time, ""amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion"".[25]Antigone, a figure from Greek mythology best known fromSophocles' play, is given in the ""Finale"" as a further example of a heroic woman. The literary critic Kathleen Blake notes Eliot's emphasis on St Teresa's ""very concrete accomplishment, the reform of a religious order"", rather than her Christian mysticism.[26]A frequent criticism by feminist critics is that not only is Dorothea  less heroic than Saint Teresa and Antigone, but George Eliot herself.[27]In response,Ruth Yeazelland Kathleen Blake chide these critics for ""expecting literary pictures of a strong woman succeeding in a period [around 1830] that did not make them likely in life"".[21]Eliot has also been criticised more widely for ending the novel with Dorothea marrying Will Ladislaw, someone so clearly her inferior.[28]The novelist Henry James describes Ladislaw as adilettantewho ""has not the concentrated fervour essential in the man chosen by so nobly strenuous a heroine"".[22]

Marriage is one of the major themes inMiddlemarch. According toGeorge Steiner, ""both principal plots [those of Dorothea and Lydgate] are case studies of unsuccessful marriage"".[18]This suggests that these ""disastrous marriages"" leave the lives of Dorothea and Lydgate unfulfilled.[29]This is arguably more the case with Lydgate than with Dorothea, who gains a second chance through her later marriage to Will Ladislaw, but a favourable interpretation of this marriage depends on the character of Ladislaw himself, whom numerous critics have viewed as Dorothea's inferior.[30]In addition, there is the ""meaningless and blissful"" marriage of Dorothea's sister Celia Brooke to Sir James Chettam, and more significantly Fred Vincy's courting of Mary Garth. In the latter, Mary Garth will not accept Fred until he abandons the Church and settles on a more suitable career. Here Fred resemblesHenry Fielding's characterTom Jones, both being moulded into a good husband by the love they give to and receive from a woman.[31]

Dorothea is a St Teresa, born in the wrong century, in provincial Middlemarch, who mistakes in her idealistic ardor, ""a poor dry mummified pedant... as a sort of angel of vocation"".[32]Middlemarchis in part aBildungsromanfocusing on the psychological or moral growth of the protagonist: Dorothea ""blindly gropes forward, making mistakes in her sometimes foolish, often egotistical, but also admirably idealistic attempt to find a role"" or vocation that fulfils her nature.[33]Lydgate is equally mistaken in his choice of a partner, as his idea of a perfect wife is someone ""who can sing and play the piano and provide a soft cushion for her husband to rest after work"". So he marries Rosamond Vincy, ""the woman in the novel who most contrasts with Dorothea"", and thereby ""deteriorates from ardent researcher to fashionable doctor in London"".[33]

The Examiner,The SpectatorandAthenaeumreviewed each of the eight books that compriseMiddlemarchas they were published from December 1871 to December 1872;[34]such reviews speculated on the eventual direction of the plot and responded accordingly.[35]Contemporary response to the novel was mixed. Writing as it was being published, theSpectatorreviewer R. H. Hutton criticised it for what he saw as its melancholic quality.[36]Athenaeum, reviewing it after ""serialisation"", found the work overwrought and thought it would have benefited from hastier composition.[b][37]Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazinereviewer W. L. Collins saw as the work's most forceful impression its ability to make readers sympathise with the characters.[38]Edith Simcox ofAcademyoffered high praises, hailing it as a landmark in fiction owing to the originality of its form; she rated it first amongst Eliot's œuvre, which meant it ""has scarcely a superior and very few equals in the whole wide range of English fiction"".[39]

Henry James presented a mixed opinion,Middlemarch, according to him, was ""at once one of the strongest and one of the weakest of English novels ...Middlemarchis a treasure-house of details, but it is an indifferent whole"". Among the details, his greatest criticism (""the only eminent failure in the book"") was of the character of Ladislaw, who he felt was an insubstantial hero-figure as against Lydgate. The scenes between Lydgate and Rosamond he especially praised for their psychological depth – he doubted whether there were any scenes ""more powerfully real... [or] intelligent"" in all English fiction.[22]Thérèse Bentzon, for theRevue des deux Mondes, was critical ofMiddlemarch. Although finding merit in certain scenes and qualities, she faulted its structure as ""made up of a succession of unconnected chapters, following each other at random... The final effect is one of an incoherence which nothing can justify."" In her view, Eliot's prioritisation of ""observation rather than imagination... inexorable analysis rather than sensibility, passion or fantasy"" means that she should not be held amongst the first ranks of novelists.[41]The German philosopherFriedrich Nietzsche, who readMiddlemarchin a translation owned by his mother and sister, derided the novel for construing suffering as a means of expiating the debt of sin, which he found characteristic of ""little moralistic females à la Eliot"".[42]

Despite the divided contemporary response,Middlemarchgained immediate admirers: in 1873, the poetEmily Dickinsonexpressed high praise for the novel, exclaiming in a letter to a friend: ""What do I think ofMiddlemarch? What do I think of glory.""[43][44][45]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde,"Gabriel John Utterson, a reserved and morally upright lawyer, and his lighthearted cousin Richard Enfield are on their weekly walk when they reach the door of a mysterious, unkempt house located down a by-street in a bustling quarter of London. Enfield recounts to Utterson that, months ago, in the eerie silence of three o'clock in the morning, he witnessed a malevolent-looking man named Edward Hyde deliberately trample a young girl after a seemingly minor collision. Enfield forced Hyde to pay her family £100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought Enfield to this door and gave him a cheque signed by a reputablegentlemanlater revealed to be Doctor Henry Jekyll, Utterson's friend and client. Utterson fears Hyde isblackmailingJekyll, as Jekyll recently changed his will to make Hyde the sole beneficiary in the event of Jekyll's death or disappearance. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with Jekyll, Jekyll says he can get rid of Hyde when he wants and asks him to drop the matter.

A year later in October, a servant sees Hyde beat Sir Danvers Carew, another one of Utterson's clients, to death and leave behind half a broken cane. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find the other half of the broken cane, which Utterson recognises as one he had given to Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who produces a note allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologising for the trouble that he has caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde.

For two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner, appearing almost rejuvenated, but in early January, he abruptly begins refusing all visitors, deepening the mystery and concern surrounding his behaviour. Dr Hastie Lanyon, a mutual friend of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a conversation with Jekyll at his laboratory window. Jekyll suddenly slams the window shut and disappears, shocking and concerning Utterson.

In early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr Poole, visits Utterson and says Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and Poole forcefully break into the laboratory, their hearts pounding with dread, only to find Hyde's lifeless body grotesquely draped in Jekyll's clothes, a scene suggesting a horrifying and desperate suicide. They find a letter from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's.

Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drink an elixir that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter explains he held himself to strict moral standards publicly, but indulged in unstated vices and struggled with shame. He found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed body, Hyde, was evil, self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. Despite this, one night he had a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, his desires having been caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to Lanyon in Jekyll's hand, asking his friend to bring chemicals from his laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses of the serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Utterson.

Eventually, the supply of salt used in the serum ran low, and subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll speculated that the original ingredient had some impurity that made it work. Realising that he would stay transformed as Hyde, Jekyll wrote out a full account of the events. Jekyll concludes by confessing that he is uncertain whether Hyde will face execution or muster the courage to end his own life, but it no longer matters to him. Jekyll's consciousness is fading fast, and whatever fate awaits, it is Hyde's alone to endure.

Gabriel John Utterson, a lawyer, has been a close loyal friend of Jekyll and Lanyon for many years. Utterson is a measured and, at all times, emotionless bachelor – who nonetheless seems believable, trustworthy, tolerant of the faults of others, and indeed genuinely likeable. However, Utterson is not immune to guilt, as he is quick to investigate and judge an interest in others' downfalls, which creates a spark of interest not only in Jekyll but also regarding Hyde. He concludes that human downfall results from indulging oneself in topics of interest. As a result of this line of reasoning, he lives life as a recluse and ""dampens his taste for the finer items of life"". Utterson concludes that Jekyll lives life as he wishes by enjoying his occupation."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641,A Room with a View,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_with_a_View,"The novel is set in the early 1900s as upper-middle-class English women are beginning to lead more independent, adventurous lives. In the first part Miss Lucy Honeychurch is touringItalywith her overly fussy spinster cousin andchaperone, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. The novel opens inFlorencewith the women complaining about their rooms at the Pensione Bertolini. They were promised rooms with a view of theRiver Arnobut instead have ones overlooking a drab courtyard. Another guest, Mr. Emerson, interrupts their ""peevish wrangling"" by spontaneously offering to swap rooms. He and his son, George, both have rooms with views of the Arno and he argues, ""Women like looking at a view; men don’t."" Charlotte rejects the offer, partly because she looks down on the Emersons' unconventional behaviour and because she fears it would place them under an ""unseemly obligation"". However another guest, Mr. Beebe, anAnglicanclergyman, persuades Charlotte to accept the offer; Charlotte suggests that the Emersons are socialists.

The following day Lucy spends a ""long morning"" in theBasilica of Santa Croce, accompanied by Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who promises to lead her on an adventure. Lavish confiscates Lucy'sBaedekerguidebook, proclaiming she will show Lucy the ""true Italy"". On the way to Santa Croce the two take a wrong turn and get lost. After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas they eventually make it to the square in front of the church, only for Lavish (who still has Lucy's Baedeker) to abandon the younger woman to pursue an old acquaintance.[1]

Inside the church Lucy runs into the Emersons. Although the other visitors find Mr. Emerson's behaviour somewhat unrefined, Lucy discovers she likes them both; she repeatedly encounters them in Florence. While touringPiazza della SignoriaLucy and George Emerson separately witness a murder. Overcome by its gruesomeness Lucy faints and is aided by George. Recovered, she asks him to retrieve the photographs she dropped near the murder scene. George finds them but as they are covered in blood he throws them into the river before telling Lucy; Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop by the River Arno before returning to the pensione they engage in a personal conversation.

Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and also to placate Charlotte, who grows wary of the eccentric Emersons. She overheard Mr. Eager, a clergyman, saying that Mr. Emerson, ""murdered his wife in the sight of God"".

Later in the week Mr. Beebe, Mr. Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Charlotte and Lucy go on a day trip toFiesole, a scenic area above Florence, driven in two carriages by Italian drivers. One driver is permitted to have a pretty girl he claims is his sister sitting next to him on the box seat. When he kisses her Mr. Eager promptly orders her to leave. In the other carriage Mr. Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love.

On a hillside Lucy abandons Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett to their gossip and goes searching for Mr Beebe. Misunderstanding Lucy's awkward Italian, the driver leads her to where George is admiring the view. Overcome by Lucy's beauty amongst a field of violets, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. However they are interrupted by Charlotte, who is shocked and upset but mostly is ruffled by her own failure as a chaperone. Lucy promises Charlotte that she will say nothing to her mother about the ""insult"" George has paid her. The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy can say goodbye to George.

In Rome Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England. Cecil twice proposes to Lucy in Italy; she rejects him both times. As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned toSurrey, England, to her family home, Windy Corner. Cecil proposes yet again and this time she accepts. Cecil is a sophisticated London aesthete whose rank and class make him a desirable match despite his despising country society; he is a rather comic figure, who is snobbish and gives himself pretentious airs.

Thevicar, Mr. Beebe, announces that a local villa has been leased; the new tenants are the Emersons, who, after a chance meeting with Cecil in London, learned about the villa being available. Cecil enticed them to come to the village as a comeuppance to the villa's landlord, Sir Harry Otway, whom Cecil (who believes himself to be very democratic) thinks is a snob. Lucy is angry with Cecil, as she had tentatively arranged for the elderly Misses Alan, who had also been guests at the Pensione Bertolini, to rent the villa.

Fate takes an ironic turn as Mr. Beebe introduces Lucy's brother, Freddy, to the Emersons. Freddy invites George for ""a bathe"" in a nearby pond in the woods. Freddy, George and Mr. Beebe go there. Freddy and George undress and jump in, eventually persuading Mr. Beebe to join them. The men enjoy themselves, frolicking and splashing in and out of the pond and running through the bushes until Lucy, her mother and Cecil, having taken a short-cut through the woods during their walk, come upon them.

Freddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner. Although Lucy is initially mortified by facing both George and Cecil she resolves to be gracious. Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of George's kissing Lucy in Fiesole. George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again. Lucy realizes that the novel was written by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.

Furious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. George argues that Cecil sees Lucy only as an ""object for the shelf"" and will never love her enough to grant her independence, whereas he loves her for who she is. Lucy is moved but remains firm. Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sees Cecil for what he truly is and ends their engagement. She decides to flee to Greece with the two Misses Alan.

Meanwhile, George, unable to bear being around Lucy, is moving his father back to London, unaware Lucy has broken off her engagement. Shortly before Lucy's departure she accidentally encounters Mr. Emerson at Mr. Beebe's house. He is unaware that Lucy is no longer engaged and Lucy is unable to lie to him. 
With open, honest talk Mr. Emerson strips away her defenses, forcing her to admit she has been in love with George all along. He also mentions how his wife had ""gone under""—lost the will to live—because she feared that George's contracting typhoid at the age of 12 was a punishment for his not being baptized. Her fear was the result of a visit by the stern clergyman Mr. Eager, and the incident explains Eager's later claim that Mr. Emerson had ""murdered his wife in the sight of God"".

The novel ends in Florence, where George and Lucy haveelopedwithout Mrs. Honeychurch's consent. However Lucy has learned that Charlotte knew that Mr. Emerson was at Mr. Beebe's that fateful day and had not discouraged nor prevented her from going in and encountering him. Although Lucy ""had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever"" (although the appendix implies a reconciliation with her family), the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.

In some editions an appendix to the novel is given entitled ""A View without a Room"", written by Forster in 1958 relating what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel. It is Forster's afterthought to the novel, and he quite clearly states that ""I cannot think where George and Lucy live."" They were quite comfortable until the end of theFirst World War, with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster. George became aconscientious objectorand lost his government job. He was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison. This left Mrs. Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law. Mr. Emerson died during the war, shortly after having a confrontation with police over Lucy's playing the music of a German composer,Beethoven, on the piano. Eventually the couple had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home. Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after Mrs. Honeychurch's death, Freddy sold the house to support his family, as he was ""an unsuccessful but prolific doctor"".

Immediately after the outbreak of theSecond World WarGeorge enlisted, seeing the need to stopHitlerand theNazi regime. He was unfaithful to Lucy during his time at war. Lucy was left homeless when her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton. George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa. Once the fascist government in Italy had fallen George returned to Florence. Finding it ""in a mess"", he was unable to find the Pensione Bertolini, stating ""the View was still there"" and that ""the room must be there, too, but could not be found."" Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await the Third World War, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.

He adds that Cecil served in ""Information or whatever the withholding of information was then entitled"" during the war and was able to trick an Alexandria hostess into playing Beethoven'sMoonlight Sonataby claiming he was Belgian, not German.

A Room with a Viewhad a lengthy gestation. By late 1902 Forster was working on a novel set in Italy which he called the 'Lucy novel'. In 1903 and 1904 he pushed it aside to work on other projects. He was still revising it in 1908.[2]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37106,"Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women,"Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, and their mother, whom they call Marmee, live in a new neighborhood (loosely based onConcord) inMassachusettsingenteel poverty. Having lost all his money, their father is serving as achaplainfor theUnion Armyin theAmerican Civil War, far from home. The mother and daughters face their firstChristmaswithout him. When Marmee asks them to give their Christmasbreakfastaway to animpoverishedfamily, the girls and their mother venture into town, laden with baskets, to feed the hungry children. When they return, they discover their wealthy, elderly neighbor, Mr. Laurence, has sent over a decadent surprise dinner, to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted following these acts of kindness.

Meg and Jo must work to support the family: Megtutorsa nearby family of four children; Jo assists her agedgreat-auntMarch, a wealthywidowliving in amansionin Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is atomboywho writes, Beth is a peacemaker and apianist, and Amy is anartistwho longs for elegance andfine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters, as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. Laurie, Mr. Laurence's orphaned grandson, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo.

The girls keep busy as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can't comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties andcotillionsfor the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor.

Word comes that Mr. March is ill withpneumoniaand Marmee leaves to nurse him inWashington, DC. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her, but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence, instead, sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to marry, so, Brooke agrees to wait.

While Marmee is in Washington, Beth contractsscarlet fever, after spending time with a poor family, where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises the family send for Marmee. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy.

While Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After being wounded, he returns to find work, so he can buy a house for when he and Meg marry. Laurie goes to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns home.

(Published separately in the United Kingdom asGood Wives)

Three years later, Meg and John wed and work to adjust to married life. When they havetwins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel neglected. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing.

Laurie graduates from college, doing well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak, due to complications from scarlet fever, lowering her spirits. While trying to understand Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it is with Beth, but soon senses it is with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother but does not love him in a romantic way.

Jo wants a little adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will overcome his feelings. She spends six months in New York City with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house, serving asgovernessfor her two children. Jo takes German lessons from another boarder, Professor Friedrich Bhaer. He has come from Berlin to care for his sister's orphaned sons. For extra money, Jo anonymously writes salacious romance stories for sensational newspapers. Suspecting her secret, Friedrich mentions such writing is unprincipled and base, which persuade Jo to give up that literary genre. As Jo's time in New York ends, she is unaware that Friedrich is in love with her. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage, which she declines.

Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's scarlet fever has left her permanently weakened. Jo becomes devoted to caring for her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe and slowly falls in love with her, seeing her in a new light. She is unimpressed by his aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude since being rejected by Jo. She inspires him to find his purpose in life and do something worthwhile. News of Beth's death brings them together and a romance soon grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return home with Laurie and his grandfather unchaperoned. Amy and Laurie marry before leaving Europe.

Friedrich, in Massachusetts on business, visits the Marches daily for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo, who realizes she loves him and they become engaged. Because Friedrich is poor, he must first establish a good income and goes west to teach. A year passes without much success. Later, Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate, Plumfield, to Jo. She marries Friedrich and turns the house into a school for boys. They have two sons, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and five grandchildren.

Meg, the oldest sister, is 16, when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and she manages the household, when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and she is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfils expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect ""little woman,"" in the eyes of the world.[14]Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of ""little women"".[15]

Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father's family's social standing, Meg makes herdebutinto high society, but she is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie's tutor. They have twins, Margaret ""Daisy"" Brooke and John Laurence ""Demi"" Brooke. The sequel,Little Men,mentions a baby daughter, Josephine ""Josie"" Brooke,[16]who is 14, at the beginning of the final book.[17]

According to Sarah Elbert, ""democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all, a secure identity that Meg lacks"".[7]: 204Others believe Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life and writes her with loving detail, suffused with sentimentality.[18]

The principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.[19][20]

Second oldest of the four sisters, Jo is masculine, the smartest, most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his ""son Jo,"" and her best friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, sometimes calls her ""my dear fellow,"" while she, alone, calls him Teddy. Jo has a ""hot"" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister, Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo.[21]In her essay, ""Recollections of My Childhood,"" Alcott refers to herself as a tomboy who enjoyed boys' activities, like running foot-races and climbing trees.

Jo lovesliterature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Laurie proposes marriage to Jo, which she rejects, thus confirming her independence. Another reason for the rejection is that the love that Laurie has for Jo is more a brotherly love, rather than romantic love, the difference between which he was unable to understand, because he was ""just a boy,"" as said by Alcott in the book.

After Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when ""they decide to share life's burdens, just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition"".[7]: 210She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred, until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March's home, a year later. According to criticBarbara Sicherman, ""The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.""[22]: 21They have two sons, Robert ""Rob"" Bhaer and Theodore ""Ted"" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part ofLittle Womenduring the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, ""her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence"".[7]: 199

Beth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family.[23]: 53Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family, and she gently scolds her sisters, when they argue.[24]As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth developsscarlet fever, after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease, but her health is permanently weakened.

As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually, she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew ""heavy.""  Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss duringLittle Womenis the death of beloved Beth. Her ""self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life, knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.""[7]: 206–207

Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family; she's 12, when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a ""regular snow-maiden,"" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, ""pale and slender"" and ""always carrying herself"" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family.[25]Often coddled, because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way, though she does still love her family.[26]: 5She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name, rather than a diminutive.[27]

Amy's aunt chooses her to accompany her to Europe, rather than her sister, Jo. There, she matures and makes a decision, based on her limited artistic talent, how to direct her adult life. She encounters Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence and his grandfather during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well in upper-class society and is at ease with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development, and her success in life seemed relatively accidental.[26]However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she can confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work hard to gain what she wants and make the most of her success, when she has it. She marries Laurie after Jo rejected him. They have a daughter, Elizabeth ""Bess"" Laurence, named after her late sister, Beth.[28]

For her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters inLittle Womenare recognizably drawn from family members and friends.[3][4]: 202Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister, was the model for Beth. Like Beth, Lizzie was quiet and retiring. She died tragically at age twenty-three from the lingering effects of scarlet fever, as did Beth.[39]May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls.[4]: 202Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as ""Miss March"" or ""Jo"", and she did not correct them.[40][41]: 31

However, Alcott's portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of theAmerican Civil War, a gainfully employedchaplain, and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel.[41]: 51In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters.[41]: 51The March family is portrayed as living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger.[42]In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised thatLittle Womenwas also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own early life.[29]: 6Originally, Alcott did not want to publishLittle Women, claiming she found it boring, and wasn't sure how to write girls as she knew few beyond her sisters. However, encouraged by her editor Thomas Niles, she wrote it within 10 weeks.[43]

Also,Little Womenhas several textual and structural references toJohn Bunyan'snovelThe Pilgrim's Progress.[44]Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the book and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times toThe Pilgrim's Progressand liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. Several chapter titles directly reference characters and places fromThe Pilgrim's Progress.

In addition to drawing on her own life during the development ofLittle Women,Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including ""The Sisters' Trial"", ""A Modern Cinderella"", and ""In the Garret"". The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott's own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters inLittle Women.[45]

The first volume ofLittle Womenwas published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers.[46]The first edition included illustrations byAbigail May Alcott, the sister commonly called ""May"" who inspired the fictional Amy March. She ""struggled"" with her illustrative additions to her sister's book, but later improved her skills and found some success as an artist.[47]

The first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with the demand for additional printings. They announced: ""The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott'sLittle Women, the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness.""[9]: 37The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume states: ""So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.""[48]Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year's Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.[10]: 345

Versions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine bothLittle WomenandGood Wivesinto one book under the titleLittle Women, with the latter marked as Part 2 (chapters 24 to 47).[49]Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with: ""In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.""[48]

The British influence, giving Part 2 its own title,Good Wives, has the book still published in two volumes, withGood Wivesbeginning three years afterLittle Womenends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed underLittle Womenappear to include both parts, especially in the audiobook versions.[citation needed]Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s to 2015.[citation needed]This split of the two volumes also shows at Goodreads, which refers to the books as theLittle Womenseries, includingLittle Women,Good Wives,Little MenandJo's Boys.[50][51][52]

G. K. Chestertonbelieved Alcott inLittle Women, ""anticipatedrealismby twenty or thirty years"", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, ""is one of the really human things in human literature"".[53]Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of ""pilgrims progress"" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.[54]

Little Womenwas well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a ""scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood"", which led more women to look toward ""literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.""[22]: 2Little Womenbecame ""the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured"".[22]: 3Adult elements of women's fiction inLittle Womenincluded ""a change of heart necessary"" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.[7]: 199

In the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of ""a decline in the radical power of women's fiction"", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a ""hearth and home"" children's story.[7]: 197Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of this ""downward spiral"". But Elbert says thatLittle Womendid not ""belittle women's fiction"" and that Alcott stayed true to her ""Romantic birthright"".[7]: 198–199

Little Women's popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown ""within the familiar construct of domesticity"".[7]: 220While Alcott had been commissioned to ""write a story for girls"", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a ""new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories"".[22]: 3–4

One reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.[22]: 3–4""Both the passionLittle Womenhas engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.""[22]: 35

At the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her ""who the little women marry"".[22]: 21Sicherman said that the ending, which she personally characterizes as ""unsatisfying"", worked to ""keep the story alive"" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.[22]: 21Anne E. Boyd contends that ""Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writingLittle Women"".[55]Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. In Sicherman's opinion, Alcott used Friedrich to ""subvert adolescent romantic ideals"" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo.[22]: 21However, the character was partially based upon older men Alcott was attracted to, such asHenry David ThoreauandRalph Waldo Emerson,[31][35]or admired, such as German writersCharles FollenandJohann Wolfgang von Goethe.[35][32][33]In particular, Alcott had considered Goethe her ""chief idol"" since the day Emerson had introduced her to Goethe and handed her a copy ofWilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship[34]Bhaer is also representative of Alcott's reverence forGerman culture.[56]

In 2003Little Womenwas ranked number 18 inThe Big Read, a survey of the British public by theBBCto determine the ""Nation's Best-loved Novel"" (not children's novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list.[57]Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted it as one of its ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[58]In 2012 it was ranked number 47 among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal, a monthly with primarily US audience.[59]

Little Womenhas been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report inThe New York Timesand cited inLittle Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays.[60]Ruth MacDonald argued that ""Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls' novel and the family story"".[61]

In the 1860s, gendered separation of children's fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs ""as class stratification increased"".[22]: 18Joy Kasson wrote, ""Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them.""[62]Girls related to the March sisters inLittle Women, along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.[22]: 22

After readingLittle Women,some women felt the need to ""acquire new and more public identities,"" however dependent on other factors, such as financial resources.[22]: 55WhileLittle Womenshowed the regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also ""legitimized"" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities.[22]: 36More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and ""stories of individual achievement—traditionally coded male—challenged women's socialization into domesticity"".[22]: 55Little Womenalso influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into the middle-class culture.

In the pages ofLittle Women, young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles.[22]: 35Little Womenrepeatedly reinforced the importance of ""individuality"" and ""female vocation"".[22]: 26Little Womenhad ""continued relevance of its subject"" and ""its longevity points, as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s"".[22]: 35Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages ofLittle Womento see how a ""democratic household"" would operate.[7]: 276

While ""Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity,"" she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society, solely because they were not married.[7]: 193""Little Womenindisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood, by insisting that the home and the women's sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world, while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements."" As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular, Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood, because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.[7]: 199

Alcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse asMaxine Hong Kingston,Margaret Atwood, andJ. K. Rowlinghave noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.[63]

Alcott's novel is often celebrated for Jo and her narrative arch in which she becomes a self-determined woman with a career. However, framing this novel as a success, solely for Jo's accomplishments, portrays it as a ""traditional 'lone genius' patriarchal narrative"" in which only women who are ""categorized as 'exceptional' or particularly 'worthy'"" are celebrated.[64]Little Womenawards all its women worthy, despite their status as conventional or unconventional—not just Jo, who is the obvious exception to societal expectation. Alcott's novel celebrates the agency of women, the four sisters and their mother, to choose their path in life. Meg makes the decision to marry and have children and though it is the traditional pathway, she makes the choice for her own happiness. Thus, reducing Alcott's novel to just Jo's experience as an exception promotes it as a patriarchal narrative and erases her careful work to portray a matriarchal narrative, rich with female agency and voice.

Alcott ""made women's rights integral to her stories, and above all, toLittle Women"".[7]: 193Alcott's fiction became her ""most important feminist contribution""—even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights"".[7]: 193She thought that ""a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society."" InLittle Women, she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth-century feminist utopia.[7]: 194

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/174,The Picture of Dorian Gray,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray,"InVictorianEngland, Lord Henry Wotton observes artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a wealthy young man who is Basil's ultimatemuse. ThehedonisticLord Henry thinks thatbeautyis the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.

Under Lord Henry's influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performsShakespeareplays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian courts her and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him ""Prince Charming"". Her brother, James, warns that if ""Prince Charming"" harms her, he will murder him.

Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in a play.[a]Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, saying that acting is her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. Returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish came true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.

Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but is too late; she has killed herself. Rationalizing his cruelty, the young man decides that he has no need for love since his immortality protects him from any consequence. Dorian locks the portrait up, and for eighteen years, he experiments with everyvice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry gave him.

One night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgentsensualism. Dorian does not deny his debauchery and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil can only identify it as his by the signature on it. Horrified, Basil beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation; angered by Basil's reaction, Dorian stabs him to death. Dorian then blackmails an old friend, scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy Basil's body. Alan later kills himself.

To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to anopium den, where, unbeknownst to him, an older James Vane is present. James has been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl's death but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the nickname she called him. There, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as ""Prince Charming"". James accosts Dorian, who deceives him into believing he is too young to have known Sibyl, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian but is then approached by a woman from the den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms Dorian's identity and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years.

James begins to stalk Dorian, who starts to fear for his life. During a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells the elderly Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that he can never be truly redeemed as he only wishes to be absolved of his sins, without truly believing that what he has done is wrong.

Deciding that only a fullconfessionwill suffice, Dorian finds the knife with which he murdered Basil and stabs the picture in a bout of fury.

His servants awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard it calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. They identify the corpse as Dorian only by the rings on the fingers, while the portrait beside him is beautiful again.

Throughout the novel, Wilde delves into the themes of morality and influence, exploring how societal values, individual relationships, and personal choices intersect to shape one's own moral compass. Dorian initially falls under Lord Henry's influence and ""narcissistic perspective on art and life"", despite Basil's warnings, but ""eventually recognizes its limitations"".[24]Through Lord Henry's dialogue, Wilde is suggesting, as professor Dominic Manganiello pointed out, that creating art enacts the innate ability to conjure criminal impulses.[24]Dorian's immersion in the elite social circles of Victorian London exposes him to a culture of superficiality and moral hypocrisy.[25]Supporting this idea, Sheldon W. Liebman offered the example of Wilde's inclusion of a great psychological intellect held by Lord Henry. Before Sybil's death, Henry was also a firm believer in vanity as the origin of a human being's irrationality.[25]This concept is broken for Henry after Sybil is found dead, the irony being that Dorian is the cause of her death and his motives are exactly as Lord Henry has taught them to him.[25]

The novel presents other relationships that influence Dorian's way of life and his perception of the world, proving the influence of society and its values on a person. While Lord Henry is clearly a persona that fascinates and captures Dorian's attention, Manganiello also suggests that Basil is also a person that may ""evoke a change of heart"" in Dorian.[24]However, at this point in the novel, Dorian has spent far too much time under Lord Henry's wing and brushes Basil off in ""appositeness"", leading Basil to claim that man has no soul but art does.[24]Dorian's journey serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of hedonism and moral relativism, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility and moral accountability in navigating the complexities of human existence.[25]

The novel's representation ofhomoeroticismis subtle yet present by manifesting itself through interactions between male characters in a way that challenges the strict social norms ofVictorianEngland.[26]The novel begins with a conversation between Lord Henry and Basil, where Basil reveals his artistic admiration for Dorian, setting the scene for a story with themes such as beauty, art, and the consequences of vanity. The interaction introduces the characters and foreshadows the complicated relationship between the artist and his muse.[3]

It has been noted by scholars that Wilde possibly chose the protagonist's name, Dorian, in reference to theDoriansofancient Greece, argued to have been the first to introduce male same-sex initiation rituals to ancient Greek culture, being an allusion toGreek love.[27]

Similarly,gender rolesinfluence the relationships between characters and form their expectations and behaviors; in particular, the expectations of masculinity and the critique of the Victorian ideal of manhood are seen throughout the narrative.[28]Dorian, with his eternal youth and beauty, challenges traditional male roles and the slow decay of his portrait reflects the deception of societal expectations. Additionally, the few female characters in the story, such as Sybil, are portrayed in ways that critique the limited roles and harsh judgments reserved for women during that era.[28]The novel's exploration of these themes provides commentary on the structures of Victorian society, revealing the performative side of gender roles that restrict and define both men and women.[3][28]

Wilde wrote in an 1894 letter:[29]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67979,The Blue Castle: a novel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Castle,"Valancy is, at twenty-nine, theold maidof the Stirling clan, which is a reputable family that has lived in the same region for over fifty years. As an only child, her entire life has been spent with her nagging mother, her perpetually down-trodden aunt, and a gossipy extended family, who, in spirit of theVictorianandmiddle class, actively discourage happiness and treat Valancy like a child, telling her what to do every day and constantly comparing her with her beautiful cousin, Olive, putting her down, and calling her by the baby name ""Doss."" Her only respites come from daydreaming of her ""Blue Castle"" and the handsome men who would reside in it with her, along with reading the nature books of John Foster.

Valancy is shockingly diagnosed with a fatal heart ailment when she goes in for a checkup, a fact she keeps secret from all of her family, since she goes to a doctor that is not considered the 'right' one, because her family has a long-lived feud with his family.

Believing she has very little time left to live, she decides to break free from the oppressive constraints, expectations, and obligations her ever-judging family has laid on her since birth. She has always judged them objectively and secretly laughed at their hypocrisy and self-righteousness. Now she decides that she shouldn't let her ever-judging relatives stop her from having a chance to 'live', letting everyone know what she thinks of them and their everyday, strife-filled actions. She starts saying aloud what she thinks of them, causing the Stirlings to conclude that she has suddenly gone 'dippy' and that they must somehow 'fix' her through prayer for her soul, guilting her, and pretending that what she does won't make them think that she is a heretic.

Valancy then scandalizes the clan even more by moving out of her mother's house and taking a position as a housekeeper for her very ill childhood friend Cissy Gay and her father, who is a master carpenter and notorious town drunk named Roaring Abel. Cissy is dying ofconsumption, but is socially ostracized for having had a child out of wedlock. The child had died soon after being born, and Cissy wasted away from her sickness and the perpetual misery of losing her beloved baby. Cissy and Valancy share a room and renew their friendship. Valancy enjoys earning a salary and spending her money in ways her family would not approve of – such as purchasing a brightly-coloured, low-necked dress. But her real satisfaction comes from doing something worthwhile, and doing it well. She also meets and spends time with Barney Snaith, who is a good friend of both Abel and Cissy, but whom town gossips are convinced is a criminal in hiding, a horrible drunk like Roaring Abel, and/or the father of Cissy's illegitimate, now-deceased child.

Towards the end, Cissy confides in Valancy, telling her about the man she fell in love with but refused to marry because he no longer loved her. Her baby compensated for her heartache, but when the infant died she was devastated. Cissy passes away quietly and Valancy makes all the funeral arrangements, setting the house in order for Abel before leaving.

All this time, the Stirling prestige has suffered from Valancy's actions, her 'going into service' and associating with 'lowlifes""; several unsuccessful attempts are made to have her come 'home.' Now they assume she will move back to live with her mother and aunt, who would magnanimously forgive her recent behaviour and gloss it over as an act of 'Christian charity'. They are appeased after the funeral when Valancy agrees that she will not stay with Roaring Abel - unaware that she has other plans. She proposes marriage to Barney, revealing that she is dying and wants to enjoy the remaining time she has left. She does not confess her love for him, instead telling him that she is 'crazy about him' and that it's one of the reasons why she picked him as a potential husband. Barney agrees to marry her, and they have a quiet ceremony the next day in the next town over. Valancy's family, who found a good match for her while she was housekeeping, are horrified by her marriage to such a 'disreputable' man (whose real crime is being unconventional and not being related to a 'good family' from the area) and effectively disown her.

Barney takes Valancy to his home on a wooded island located on Lake 'Mistawis,' which Valancy sees as the 'Blue Castle' of her imaginings. They build a contented life together, though he forbids her from ever entering a certain room which she dubs 'Bluebeard's Chamber', claiming that he could have multiple wives strung up on the walls by their hair. Barney and Valancy share wonderful conversations and take long walks on the mainland, she often quoting from books by John Foster, which he abhors and refuses to listen to. They celebrate Christmas, he giving her the only gift she asked for: a necklace of pearl beads.

Valancy also takes the time to exorcise old demons, building a large sand pile to make up for one that her cousin Olive had stolen from her when they were in grade school. Also, while Valancy is collecting moss and flowers to decorate their cabin, she comes upon Allan Tierney, a celebrated painter of beautiful women, who, when he sees her, hastens to find Barney and asks to paint her portrait, which he declines. Valancy agrees with his decision, although she wishes that Olive, her snooty cousin, would hear that Allan Tierney wanted to paint her.

The year that she had to live is almost over when Valancy is nearly killed by an oncoming train, her fancy heeled shoe caught in a train track. Barney saves her in the nick of time, risking his own life to do so. After the shock passes, Valancy realizes that she should have died of it - the doctor warned that any sudden shock would kill her. Barney is likewise stunned by the experience and retreats to his beloved woods and Bluebeard's Chamber to think. Valancy assumes that he has left because, having married her out of pity, he now realizes he is trapped in a marriage he doesn't desire.

Valancy returns to the doctor, who discovers that he sent Valancy ""Stirling"" a letter with a diagnosis meant for Miss ""Sterling,"" an elderly, spinster patient who visited him on the same day and had a fatal heart condition; Valancy's letter went to her instead. While equally painful, Valancy's condition was temporary and could be healed from a sudden jolt of happiness, sadness, or adrenaline.

Arriving home from the doctor depressed, with Barney still away, she finds a gaudily dressed man waiting near their home. He introduces himself as Barney's father, Dr. Redfern, the multi-millionaire inventor of Dr. Redfern'spatent medicines. Dr. Redfern explains that a decade earlier Bernard Snaith Redfern abruptly left home without a word, having dumped the girlfriend he thought loved him, finding out she was a gold-digger. Dr. Redfern had no idea where his son was (as Barney was constantly traveling and only sent a few postcards) until Barney withdrew $15,000 (+/-$226,000 in 2023) from his bank account to purchase a pearl necklace from a reputable jewelry house. Dr. Redfern is a genial man overall, and although sad that he wasn't invited to the wedding, is pleased that Barney has settled down and asks that Barney come home as he is the only family he has.

Thinking that Barney believes she tricked him into marriage and that he still loves his ex-girlfriend, Valancy decides to leave him and return to her mother's house. While searching for pen and paper to write Barney an explanatory note, she unthinkingly goes into 'Bluebeard's Chamber' and discovers that he is also 'John Foster,' her favourite author. She writes the note, explaining the mix-up behind her diagnosis and asking for a divorce, knowing now that he can afford it and leaves behind the necklace, which she had earlier thought an expensive imitation.

Valancy returns home despondent and reveals to her family that Barney is the son of famous and wealthy Dr. Redfern, as well as the noted literary figure John Foster. Barney's wealth instantly erases any misgivings her family had about him, and they are determined that Barney and Valancy should stay together; her wealthy uncle, Benjamin, knowing now that she has married a millionaire's son - therefore redeeming herself - un-disowns her.

Barney, after meeting his father, finds Valancy's note and rushes to town to see her and ask her to come back. Barney's absence after the train incident was due to the stunned realization that he had grown to love her so much, he would not want to live without her and so he was contemplating contacting his father for the first time in a decade to ask for money to pay for expensive medical treatments that could somehow heal her. At first she refuses, believing that he is only asking out of pity, but when he becomes angry, thinking she is ashamed of his father's patent medicine business just like his ex-girlfriend was, she realizes he does love her and agrees to return.

Barney reconciles with his father but will not live with him; they will build a home of their own out in the country, but near enough to visit. Meanwhile Barney and Valancy prepare to go on the honeymoon they never had, albeit extended and while touring Europe, knowing their summer home on Barney's small island - her 'Blue Castle' - will be waiting for them.

In a postscript, Olive is writing to her fiancee, Cecil Bruce, telling him about Valancy marrying Barney and how they discovered he was a millionaire in his own right, and how now every single relative is positively fawning over the couple. In an almost jealous diatribe, she wonders why some people can make their entire lives an utter mess with their adventures and yet end up married to a rich person, and she says that if this is what happens when someone runs away and flouts family expectations, then what is the use in behaving?

Almost all editions of The Blue Castle lack dust jackets. The true first edition does not have a castle on the front boards, it was added after Montgomery had commented, ""Not so pretty. A plain cover.""[3]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16389,The Enchanted April,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enchanted_April,"The novel follows four dissimilar women in 1920sEnglandwho leave their rainy, grey environments to go on holiday in Italy. Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins, who belong to the same ladies' club but have never spoken, become acquainted after reading a newspaper advertisement for a small medieval castle on the Mediterranean to be let furnished for the month of April. They find some common ground in that both are struggling to make the best of unhappy marriages.  They also reluctantly take on the waspish, elderly Mrs. Fisher and the stunning but aloof Lady Caroline Dester to defray expenses. The very genuine and open Lotty Wilkins, often muddled and awkward in her speech, has been married only a few years, but she and her husband are rubbing each other the wrong way; as the novel progresses, her intuition into her new friends' feelings and needs plays a major role. Rose Arbuthnot is a highly religious lady who does extensive charity work but is married to an author of racy popular novels who neglects her, partly because of her persistent disapproval of his work. Lady Caroline Dester is a beautiful socialite who is tired of the burden of London society and is beginning to regard her life as shallow and empty after a man she loved died in WWI. Mrs. Fisher is a pompous, snobbish, highly proper lady who knew many Victorian luminaries and regards herself as the hostess and in control of the holiday; she prefers to live in her memories of times past rather than embracing the present and is emotionally closed-off. The four women experience interpersonal tensions but eventually come together at the castle and find rejuvenation in the tranquil beauty of their surroundings, rediscovering hope and love.

The Enchanted Aprilhas regularly been adapted for the stage and screen:

...she decidedpro tem, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading
Nerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the
category Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but
Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final
categories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay
that she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them
out again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.

For Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live on
the proceeds of Frederick's activities, and her very nest-egg was the
fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made his
living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote
immensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of
kings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses, and
there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so that he
had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of his
married life, and even so there were greater further piles of these
ladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether
she liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave
her a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir,
with swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her a
miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this
re-incarnation of a dead old French sinner."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554,Crime and Punishment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in a tiny rented room in Saint Petersburg. Isolated and antisocial, he has abandoned all attempts to support himself and is brooding obsessively on a scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawnbroker. On the pretext of pawning a watch, he visits her apartment, but he remains unable to commit himself. Later in a tavern, he makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Marmeladov tells him about his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has become aprostitutein order to support the family. The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister Dunya, who has been working as a governess, with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov. To escape her vulnerable position, and with hopes of helping her brother, Dunya has chosen to marry a wealthy suitor, Luzhin, whom they are coming to meet in Petersburg. Details in the letter suggest that Luzhin is a conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of Dunya's situation. Raskolnikov is enraged at his sister's sacrifice, feeling it is the same as what Sonya felt compelled to do. Painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence, his thoughts return to his idea. A further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it.

In a state of extreme nervous tension, Raskolnikov steals an axe and makes his way once more to the old woman's apartment. He gains access by pretending he has something to pawn, and then attacks her with the axe, killing her. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime. Shaken by his actions, he steals only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawnbroker's wealth untouched. Due to sheer good fortune, he manages to escape the building and return to his room undetected.

In a feverish and semi-delirious state Raskolnikov conceals the stolen items and falls asleep exhausted. He is greatly alarmed the next morning when he gets summoned to the police station, but it turns out to be in relation to a debt notice from his landlady. When the officers at the bureau begin talking about the murder, Raskolnikov faints. He quickly recovers, but he can see from their faces that he has aroused suspicion. Fearing a search, he hides the stolen items under a large rock in an empty yard, noticing in humiliation that he has not even checked how much money is in the purse. Without knowing why, he visits his old university friend Razumikhin, who observes that Raskolnikov seems to be seriously ill. Finally he returns to his room where he succumbs to his illness and falls into a prolonged delirium.

When he emerges several days later he finds that Razumikhin has tracked him down and has been nursing him. Still feverish, Raskolnikov listens nervously to a conversation between Razumikhin and the doctor about the status of the police investigation into the murders: amuzhikcalled Mikolka, who was working in a neighbouring flat at the time, has been detained, and the old woman's clients are being interviewed. They are interrupted by the arrival of Luzhin, Dunya's fiancé, who wishes to introduce himself, but Raskolnikov deliberately insults him and kicks him out. He angrily tells the others to leave as well, and then sneaks out himself. He looks for news about the murder, and seems almost to want to draw attention to his own part in it. He encounters the police official Zamyotov, who was present when he fainted in the bureau, and openly mocks the young man's unspoken suspicions. He returns to the scene of the crime and re-lives the sensations he experienced at the time. He angers the workmen and caretakers by asking casual questions about the murder, even suggesting that they accompany him to the police station to discuss it. As he contemplates whether or not to confess, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage. He rushes to help and succeeds in conveying the stricken man back to his family's apartment. Calling out for Sonya to forgive him, Marmeladov dies in his daughter's arms. Raskolnikov gives his last twenty five roubles (from money sent to him by his mother) to Marmeladov's consumptive widow, Katerina Ivanovna, saying it is the repayment of a debt to his friend.

Feeling renewed, Raskolnikov calls on Razumikhin, and they go back together to Raskolnikov's building. Upon entering his room Raskolnikov is deeply shocked to see his mother and sister sitting on the sofa. They have just arrived in Petersburg and are ecstatic to see him, but Raskolnikov is unable to speak, and collapses in a faint.

Razumikhin tends to Raskolnikov, and manages to convince the distressed mother and sister to return to their apartment. He goes with them, despite being drunk and rather overwhelmed by Dunya's beauty. When they return the next morning Raskolnikov has improved physically, but it becomes apparent that he is still mentally distracted and merely forcing himself to endure the meeting. He demands that Dunya break with Luzhin, but Dunya fiercely defends her motives for the marriage. Mrs Raskolnikova has received a note from Luzhin demanding that her son not be present at any future meetings between them.  He also informs her that he witnessed her son give the 25 rubles to ""an unmarried woman of immoral behavior"" (Sonya). Dunya has decided that a meeting, at which both Luzhin and her brother are present, must take place, and Raskolnikov agrees to attend that evening along with Razumikhin. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Sonya suddenly appears at his door. Timidly, she explains that he left his address with them last night, and that she has come to invite him to attend her father's funeral. As she leaves, Raskolnikov asks for her address and tells her that he will visit her soon.

At Raskolnikov's behest, Razumikhin takes him to see the detective Porfiry Petrovich, who is investigating the murders. Raskolnikov immediately senses that Porfiry knows that he is the murderer. Porfiry, who has just been discussing the case with Zamyotov, adopts an ironic tone during the conversation. He expresses extreme curiosity about an article that Raskolnikov wrote some months ago called 'On Crime', in which he suggests that certain rare individuals—the benefactors and geniuses of mankind—have a right to 'step across' legal or moral boundaries if those boundaries are an obstruction to the success of their idea. Raskolnikov defends himself skillfully, but he is alarmed and angered by Porfiry's insinuating tone. An appointment is made for an interview the following morning at the police bureau.

Leaving Razumikhin with his mother and sister, Raskolnikov returns to his own building. He is surprised to find an old artisan, whom he does not know, making inquiries about him. Raskolnikov tries to find out what he wants, but the artisan says only one word – ""murderer"", and walks off. Petrified, Raskolnikov returns to his room and falls into thought and then sleeps. He wakens from an eerie nightmare about the murder of the old woman to find another complete stranger present, this time a man of aristocratic appearance. The man politely introduces himself as Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov.

Svidrigailov indulges in an amiable but disjointed monologue, punctuated by Raskolnikov's terse interjections. He claims to no longer have any romantic interest in Dunya, but wants to stop her from marrying Luzhin, and offers her ten thousand roubles. Raskolnikov refuses the money on her behalf and refuses to facilitate a meeting. Svidrigailov also mentions that his wife, who defended Dunya at the time of the unpleasantness but died shortly afterwards, has left her 3000 rubles in her will.

The meeting with Luzhin that evening begins with talk of Svidrigailov—his depraved character, his presence in Petersburg, the unexpected death of his wife and the 3000 rubles left to Dunya. Luzhin takes offence when Dunya insists on resolving the issue with her brother, and when Raskolnikov draws attention to the slander in his letter, Luzhin becomes reckless, exposing his true character. Dunya tells him to leave and never come back. Now free and with significant capital, they excitedly begin to discuss plans for the future, but Raskolnikov suddenly gets up and leaves, telling them, to their great consternation, that it might be the last time he sees them. He instructs the baffled Razumikhin to remain and always care for them.

Raskolnikov proceeds to Sonya's place. She is gratified that he is visiting her, but also frightened of his strange manner. He asks a series of merciless questions about her terrible situation and that of Katerina Ivanovna and the children. Raskolnikov begins to realize that Sonya is sustained only by her faith in God. She reveals that she was a friend of the murdered Lizaveta. In fact, Lizaveta gave her a cross and a copy of the Gospels. She passionately reads to him the story of the raising of Lazarus from the Gospel of John. His fascination with her, which had begun at the time when her father spoke of her, increases and he decides that they must face the future together. As he leaves he tells her that he will come back tomorrow and tell her who killed her friend Lizaveta.

When Raskolnikov presents himself for his interview, Porfiry resumes and intensifies his insinuating, provocative, ironic chatter, without ever making a direct accusation. With Raskolnikov's anger reaching fever pitch, Porfiry hints that he has a ""little surprise"" for him behind the partition in his office, but at that moment there is a commotion outside the door and a young man (Mikolka the painter) bursts in, followed by some policemen. To both Porfiry and Raskolnikov's astonishment, Mikolka proceeds to loudly confess to the murders. Porfiry does not believe the confession, but he is forced to let Raskolnikov go. Back at his room Raskolnikov is horrified when the old artisan suddenly appears at his door. But the man bows and asks for forgiveness: he had been Porfiry's ""little surprise"", and had heard Mikolka confess. He had been one of those present when Raskolnikov returned to the scene of the murders, and had reported his behavior to Porfiry.

Raskolnikov attends the Marmeladovs' post-funeral banquet at Katerina Ivanovna's apartment. The atmosphere deteriorates as guests become drunk and the half-mad Katerina Ivanovna engages in a verbal attack on her German landlady. With chaos descending, everyone is surprised by the sudden and portentous appearance of Luzhin. He sternly announces that a 100-ruble banknote disappeared from his apartment at the precise time that he was being visited by Sonya, whom he had invited in order to make a small donation. Sonya fearfully denies stealing the money, but Luzhin persists in his accusation and demands that someone search her. Outraged, Katerina Ivanovna abuses Luzhin and sets about emptying Sonya's pockets to prove her innocence, but a folded 100-ruble note does indeed fly out of one of the pockets. The mood in the room turns against Sonya, Luzhin chastises her, and the landlady orders the family out. But Luzhin's roommate Lebezyatnikov arrives, and angrily asserts that he saw Luzhin surreptitiously slip the money into Sonya's pocket as she left, although he had thought at the time that it was a noble act of anonymous charity. Raskolnikov backs Lebezyatnikov up by confidently identifying Luzhin's motive: a desire to avenge himself on Raskolnikov by defaming Sonya, in hopes of causing a rift with his family. Luzhin is discredited, but Sonya is traumatized, and she runs out of the apartment. Raskolnikov follows her.

Back at her room, Raskolnikov draws Sonya's attention to the ease with which Luzhin could have ruined her, and consequently the children as well. But it is only a prelude to his confession that he is the murderer of the old woman and Lizaveta. Painfully, he tries to explain his abstract motives for the crime to uncomprehending Sonya. She is horrified, not just at the crime, but at his own self-torture, and tells him that he must hand himself in to the police. Lebezyatnikov appears and tells them that the landlady has kicked Katerina Ivanovna out of the apartment and that she has gone mad. They find Katerina Ivanovna surrounded by people in the street, completely insane, trying to force the terrified children to perform for money, and near death from her illness. They manage to get her back to Sonya's room, where, distraught and raving, she dies. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Svidrigailov suddenly appears and informs him that he will be using the ten thousand rubles intended for Dunya to make the funeral arrangements and to place the children in good orphanages. When Raskolnikov asks him what his motives are, he laughingly replies with direct quotations of Raskolnikov's own words, spoken when he was trying to explain his justifications for the murder to Sonya. Svidrigailov has been residing next door to Sonya, and overheard every word of the murder confession.

Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that Dunya has become troubled and distant after receiving a letter from someone. He also mentions, to Raskolnikov's astonishment, that Porfiry no longer suspects him of the murders. As Raskolnikov is about to set off in search of Svidrigailov, Porfiry himself appears and politely requests a brief chat. He sincerely apologises for his previous behavior and seeks to explain the reasons behind it. Strangely, Raskolnikov begins to feel alarmed at the thought that Porfiry might think he is innocent. But Porfiry's changed attitude is motivated by genuine respect for Raskolnikov, not by any thought of his innocence, and he concludes by expressing his absolute certainty that Raskolnikov is indeed the murderer. He claims that he will be arresting him soon, but urges him to confess to make it easier on himself. Raskolnikov chooses to continue the struggle.

Raskolnikov finds Svidrigailov at an inn and warns him against approaching Dunya. Svidrigailov, who has in fact arranged to meet Dunya, threatens to go to the police, but Raskolnikov is unconcerned and follows when he leaves. When Raskolnikov finally turns home, Dunya, who has been watching them, approaches Svidrigailov and demands to know what he meant in his letter about her brother's ""secret"". She reluctantly accompanies him to his rooms, where he reveals what he overheard and attempts to use it to make her yield to his desire. Dunya, however, has a gun and she fires at him, narrowly missing: Svidrigailov gently encourages her to reload and try again. Eventually she throws the gun aside, but Svidrigailov, crushed by her hatred for him, tells her to leave. Later that evening he goes to Sonya to discuss the arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna's children. He gives her 3000 rubles, telling her she will need it if she wishes to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. He spends the night in a miserable hotel and the following morning commits suicide in a public place.

Raskolnikov says a painful goodbye to his mother, without telling her the truth. Dunya is waiting for him at his room, and he tells her that he will be going to the police to confess to the murders. He stops at Sonya's place on the way and she gives him a crucifix. At the bureau, he learns of Svidrigailov's suicide, and almost changes his mind, even leaving the building. However, he sees Sonya (who has followed him) looking at him in despair, and he returns to make a full and frank confession to the murders.

Due to the fullness of his confession at a time when another man had already confessed, and his state of mind at the time of the murders, Raskolnikov is sentenced to only eight years of penal servitude. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and plan to move to Siberia, but Raskolnikov's mother falls ill and dies. Sonya follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, but he is initially hostile towards her as he is still struggling to acknowledge moral culpability for his crime, feeling himself to be guilty only of weakness. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence.

InCrime and Punishment, Dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character,Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of ""ideological intoxication,"" and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychological consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov's psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught.[24]From another point of view, the novel's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, ""Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society asHonoré de Balzac'sRastignacorStendhal'sJulien Sorel, but to those of rationalistic Petersburg"".[25]

Raskolnikov(Rodion Romanovitch) is theprotagonist, and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective. A 23-year-old former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov is described in the novel as ""exceptionally handsome, taller than average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair."" On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of impulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it.

Despite its title, the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment as with Raskolnikov's internal struggle – the torments of his own conscience, rather than the legal consequences of committing the crime. Believing society would be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possesses enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.

Sonya(Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova) is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and innocent, despite being forced into prostitution to help her family. Raskolnikov discerns in her the same feelings of shame and alienation that he experiences, and she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime. Sensing his deep unhappiness, she supports him, even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov.

Razumíkhin(Dmitry Prokofyich) is Raskolnikov's loyal friend and also a former law student. The character is intended to represent something of a reconciliation between faith and reason (razum, ""sense"", ""intelligence""). He jokes that his name is actually Vrazumíkhin – a name suggesting ""to bring someone to their senses"".[26]He is upright, strong, resourceful and intelligent, but also somewhat naïve – qualities that are of great importance to Raskolnikov in his desperate situation. He admires Raskolnikov's intelligence and character, refuses to give any credence to others' suspicions, and supports him at all times. He looks after Raskolnikov's family when they come to Petersburg, falling in love with and later marrying Dunya.

Dunya(Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) –  Raskolnikov's beautiful and strong-willed sister who works as a governess. She initially plans to marry the wealthy but unsavory lawyer Luzhin, thinking it will enable her to ease her family's desperate financial situation and escape her former employer Svidrigailov. Her situation is a factor in Raskolnikov's decision to commit the murder. In St. Petersburg, she is eventually able to escape the clutches of both Luzhin and Svidrigailov, and later marries Razumikhin.

Luzhin(Pyotr Petrovich) – A well-off lawyer who is engaged to Dunya in the beginning of the novel. His motives for the marriage are dubious, as he more or less states that he has sought a woman who will be completely beholden to him. He slanders and falsely accuses Sonya of theft in an attempt to harm Raskolnikov's relations with his family. Luzhin represents immorality, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.

Svidrigaïlov(Arkady Ivanovich) – Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and former pursuer of Dunya. He overhears Raskolnikov's confessions to Sonya and uses this knowledge to torment both Dunya and Raskolnikov, but does not inform the police. Despite his apparent malevolence, Svidrigaïlov seems to be capable of generosity and compassion. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go. He tells Sonya that he has made financial arrangements for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage, and gives her three thousand rubles, enabling her to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. Having left the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée, he commits suicide.

Porfiry Petrovich– The head of the Investigation Department in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does this through psychological means, seeking to confuse and provoke the volatile Raskolnikov into a voluntary or involuntary confession. He later drops these methods and sincerely urges Raskolnikov to confess for his own good.

Dostoevsky's letter to Katkov reveals his immediate inspiration, to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into a much more ambitious creation: a desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines ofRussian nihilism.[27]In the novel, Dostoevsky pinpointed the dangers of bothutilitarianismandrationalism, the main ideas of which inspired the radicals, continuing a fierce criticism he had already started with hisNotes from Underground.[28]Dostoevsky utilized the characters, dialogue and narrative inCrime and Punishmentto articulate an argument againstWesternizingideas. He thus attacked a peculiar Russian blend of Frenchutopian socialismandBenthamiteutilitarianism, which had developed under revolutionary thinkers such asNikolai Chernyshevskyand became known asrational egoism.
The radicals refused to recognize themselves in the novel's pages, since Dostoevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences.Dimitri Pisarevridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of the time. The radicals' aims were altruistic and humanitarian, but they were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing the spontaneous outflow of Christian compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.[29]Dostoevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.[30]

Raskolnikov exemplifies the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal. Contemporary scholar Joseph Frank writes that ""the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity on the one hand and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd"".[31]Raskolnikov's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and ""useless"" old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoevsky wants to show that this utilitarian style of reasoning had become widespread and commonplace; it was by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov's tormented and disordered mind.[32]Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov's character, and help justify his contempt for humanity's lower qualities and ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher social good, believes that he possesses a moral right to kill. Indeed, his ""Napoleon-like"" plan impels him toward a well-calculated murder, the ultimate conclusion of his self-deception with utilitarianism.[33]

Dostoevsky was among the first to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regardsCrime and Punishmentas the first great Russian novel ""in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor"".[34]

Dostoevsky's Petersburg is the city of unrelieved poverty; ""magnificence has no place in it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold"". Dostoevsky connects the city's problems to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions.[35]The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that ""the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched.""[36]

In his depiction of Petersburg, Dostoevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov's eyes. He uses Raskolnikov's encounter with Marmeladov to contrast the heartlessness of Raskolnikov's convictions with a Christian approach to poverty and wretchedness.[32]Dostoevsky believes that the moral ""freedom"" propounded by Raskolnikov is a dreadful freedom ""that is contained by no values, because it is before values"". In seeking to affirm this ""freedom"" in himself, Raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God.[37]He thinks that he is self-sufficient and self-contained, but at the end ""his boundless self-confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself, and his self-fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God"".[38]Dostoevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of ""sick"" Russian society through the re-discovery of its national identity, its religion, and its roots.[39]

The novel is divided into six parts, with anepilogue. The notion of ""intrinsic duality"" inCrime and Punishmenthas been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree ofsymmetryto the book.[40]Edward Wasiolek, who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure ofCrime and Punishmentto a ""flattened X"", saying:

This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel's six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as David Bethea has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the ""left"" half of the novel reflects the ""right"" half.[40]

The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky's critics have criticized the novel's final pages as superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy of the rest of the work,[42]while others have defended it, offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues thatCrime and Punishment""is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale"".[43]Cassedy concludes that ""the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue inCrime and Punishment... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue"".[44]

Crime and Punishmentis written from athird-personomniscient perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov, but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as Svidrigaïlov, Razumikhin, Luzhin, Sonya or Dunya. This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters, was original for its period. Frank notes that Dostoevsky's use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments ofHenry James,Joseph Conrad,Virginia Woolf, andJames Joyce. A late nineteenth-century reader was, however, accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration. This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman, and to observations like the following byMelchior de Vogüé: ""A word ... one does not even notice, a small fact that takes up only a line, have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [so that] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages"".[45]

Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters. Those who use artificial language—Luzhin, for example—are identified as unattractive people. Mrs. Marmeladov's disintegrating mind is reflected in her language. In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters have something of adouble meaning, but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture. For example, the original Russian title (""Преступление и наказание"") is not the direct equivalent to the English ""Crime and Punishment"". ""Преступление"" (Prestupléniye) is literally translated as 'a stepping across'. The physical image of crime as crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation, as is the religious implication of transgression.[46]

The first part ofCrime and Punishmentpublished in the January and February issues ofThe Russian Messengermet with public success. In his memoirs, the conservative belletristNikolay Strakhovrecalled thatCrime and Punishmentwas the literary sensation of 1866 in Russia.[47]Tolstoy's novelWar and Peacewas being serialized inThe Russian Messengerat the same time asCrime and Punishment.

The novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations, and wondered, ""Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?"" Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value, described Raskolnikov as a product of his environment, and argued that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy with which Dostoevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: ""This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it.""[48][49]Solovyov felt that the meaning of the novel, despite the common failure to understand it, is clear and simple: a man who considers himself entitled to 'step across' discovers that what he thought was an intellectually and even morally justifiable transgression of an arbitrary law turns out to be, for his conscience, ""a sin, a violation of inner moral justice... that inward sin of self-idolatry can only be redeemed by an inner act of self-renunciation.""[50]

The earlySymbolistmovement that dominated Russian letters in the 1880s was concerned more with aesthetics than the visceral realism and intellectuality ofCrime and Punishment, but a tendency toward mysticism among the new generation of symbolists in the 1900s led to a reevaluation of the novel as an address to the dialectic of spirit and matter.[51]In the character of Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna) they saw an embodiment of both the Orthodox feminine principle ofhagia sophia(holy wisdom) – ""at once sexual and innocent, redemptive both in her suffering and her veneration of suffering"", and the most important feminine deity of Russian folkloremat syra zemlya(moist mother earth).[52]Raskolnikov is a ""son of Earth"" whose egoistic aspirations lead him to ideas and actions that alienate him from the very source of his strength, and he must bow down to her before she can relieve him of the terrible burden of his guilt.[53][54]Philosopher and Orthodox theologianNikolay Berdyaevshared Solovyov and the symbolists' sense of the novel's spiritual significance, seeing it as an illustration of the modern age's hubristic self-deification, or what he calls ""the suicide of man by self-affirmation"". Raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will, but, according to Berdyaev, these are questions that can only be answered by God, and ""he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself: that is the meaning ofCrime and Punishment"".[55][56]

Crime and Punishmentwas regarded as an important work in a number of 20th-century European cultural movements, notably theBloomsbury Group,psychoanalysis, andexistentialism. Of the writers associated with Bloomsbury,Virginia Woolf,John Middleton MurryandD. H. Lawrenceare some of those who have discussed the work.Freudheld Dostoevsky's work in high esteem, and many of his followers have attempted psychoanalytical interpretations of Raskolnikov.[57]Among the existentialists,SartreandCamusin particular have acknowledged Dostoevsky's influence.[58]

The affinity ofCrime and Punishmentwith both religious mysticism and psychoanalysis led to suppression of discussion inSovietRussia: interpretations of Raskolnikov tended to align with Pisarev's idea of reaction to unjust socio-economic conditions.[59]An exception was the work ofMikhail Bakhtin, considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of Dostoevsky's work. InProblems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, Bakhtin argues that attempts to understand Dostoevsky's characters from the vantage point of a pre-existing philosophy, or as individualized ""objects"" to be psychologically analysed, will always fail to penetrate the unique ""artistic architechtonics"" of his works.[60]In such cases, both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are monological: everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of a single overarching perspective, whether that of the critic or that of the author. Dostoevsky's art, Bakhtin argues, is inherently dialogical: events proceed on the basis of interaction between self-validating subjective voices, often within the consciousness of an individual character, as is the case with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov's consciousness is depicted as a battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel: everyone and everything he encounters becomes reflected and refracted in a ""dialogized"" interior monologue.[61]He has rejected external relationships and chosen his tormenting internal dialogue; only Sonya is capable of continuing to engage with him despite his cruelty. His openness to dialogue with Sonya is what enables him to cross back over the ""threshold into real-life communication (confession and public trial)—not out of guilt, for he avoids acknowledging his guilt, but out of weariness and loneliness, for that reconciling step is the only relief possible from the cacophony of unfinalized inner dialogue.""[62]

The Garnett translation was the dominant translation for more than 80 years after its publication in 1914. Since the 1990s, McDuff and Pevear/Volokhonsky have become its major competitors.[63]"

Ignoring the Count's warning, Harker wanders the castle at night and encountersthree vampire women; Dracula rescues Harker, and gives the women a small child bound inside a bag. Six weeks later, Dracula leaves the castle, abandoning Harker to the women. Harker escapes and ends up delirious in aBudapesthospital. Dracula takes a ship called theDemeterfor England with boxes of earth from his castle. The captain'slognarrates the crew's disappearance until he alone remains, bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling a large dog is seen leaping ashore when the ship runs aground atWhitby.

Lucy Westenra's letter to her best friend, Harker's fiancéeMina Murray, describes her marriage proposals fromDr. John Seward,Quincey Morris, andArthur Holmwood. Lucy accepts Holmwood's, but all remain friends. Mina joins Lucy on holiday in Whitby. Lucy begins tosleepwalk. After Dracula's ship lands in Whitby, he begins to stalk Lucy. Mina receives a letter about her missing fiancé's illness and goes to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill; Seward's old teacher—Professor Abraham Van Helsing—determines the nature of her condition, but he refuses to disclose it, instead diagnosing it as acuteblood-loss. Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a necklace of them. Lucy's mother removes the garlic flowers, not knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra dies of aheart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a ""bloofer lady"" (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is Lucy. Seward, Morris, Arthur and Van Helsing go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They stake her heart,beheadher, and fill her mouth with garlic. Jonathan Harker and his new bride Mina return and join the campaign against Dracula.

Everyone stays at Seward's asylum as the men begin to hunt Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient,Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their life force. After Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he uses Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times, drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on the final visit, cursing her to become a vampire after her death unless Dracula is killed. The men discover that Dracula has distributed his boxes of earth around various properties in London. After sterilizing most of the distributed boxes, the group fails to trap the Count in hisPiccadillyhouse and learns that Dracula is fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing exploits Mina's faint psychic connection to Dracula to track his movements and they pursue, guided by Mina.

InGalatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Harker and Holmwood pursue Dracula's boat on the river, while Morris and Seward follow them on land. Dracula's box is loaded onto a wagon byRomanimen; the hunters attack and rout the Romani. HarkerdecapitatesDracula as Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Romani. He dies, at peace knowing that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.

Bram Stokerwas born inClontarf, Dublinon 8 November 1842 as the third of seven children. A sickly child, he was homeschooled before attending a private day school.[1]Stoker attendedTrinity College Dublinin the 1860s and began writing theatre reviews in the early 1870s. After Stoker wrote a review of a performance by stage actorHenry Irving, the two became friends. In 1878, Irving offered Stoker a job as the business manager of London'sLyceum Theatre, which he accepted. He marriedFlorence Balcombelater that year.[2]Biographer Lisa Hopkins notes that this role required Stoker to be sociable and introduced him to the elites ofVictorian London. Nonetheless, Stoker described himself as a private person who closely guarded his thoughts.[3]

He supplemented his theatre income by writingromanceandsensation novels,[4][5][a]but was more closely identified during his lifetime with the theatre than he was with the literary world.[7]By the time of his death in 1912, Stoker had published 18 books.[8]Draculawas Stoker's seventh published book, followingThe Shoulder of Shasta(1895) and precedingMiss Betty(1898).[9][b]Stoker's grand-nephew,Daniel Farson, wrote that Stoker may have died from syphilis, but this is widely disputed by scholars.[c]Novelist and playwrightHall Caine, a close friend of Stoker's,[d]wrote in Stoker's obituary inThe Daily Telegraphthat—besides hisbiographyon Irving—Stoker wrote only ""to sell"" and ""had no higher aims"".[15]

Folkloric vampires predate Stoker's Dracula by hundreds of years.[16]Stoker adopted some characteristics of folkloric vampires for his own, such as their aversion to garlic and staking as a means of killing them.[17]He invented other attributes—for example, Stoker's vampires must be invited into one's home, sleep on earth from their homeland and have no reflection in mirrors.[18]Sunlight is not fatal to Dracula in the novel—this was an invention of the unauthorisedDraculafilmNosferatu(1922)—but it does weaken him.[19][20]Some of Stoker's inventions applied unrelated lore to vampires for the first time; for example, Dracula has no reflection because of a folkloric concept that mirrors show the human soul.[20]Some Irish scholars have suggestedIrish folkloreas an inspiration for the novel,[21]for example the revenantAbhartach,[21]and the 11th-century High King of IrelandBrian Boru.[22][e]DraculascholarElizabeth Millernotes that in his childhood Stoker was exposed to supernatural tales and Irish oral history involving premature burials and staked bodies.[24]

Count Draculahas literary progenitors.John William Polidori's ""The Vampyre"" (1819) includes an aristocratic vampire with powers of seduction.[25]The lesbian vampire ofSheridan Le Fanu'sCarmilla(1872) can transform into a cat, as Dracula can transform into a dog.[26]Dracula resembles earlier Gothic villains in appearance,[27]with Miller comparing him to the villains ofAnn Radcliffe'sThe Italian(1796) andMatthew Gregory Lewis'sThe Monk(1796).[28]

There is almost unanimous consensus that Dracula was inspired, in part, by Henry Irving. Scholars note the Count's tall and lean physique and aquiline nose,[29]withDraculascholarWilliam Hughesspecifically citing the influence of Irving's performance asShylockin aLyceum Theatreproduction ofThe Merchant of Venice.[30]Stoker's contemporaries remarked upon the similarity.[31]Stoker had praised a performance of Irving as ""a wonderful impression of a dead man fictitiously alive [with eyes like] cinders of glowing red from out the marble face"".[32]Louis S. Warrenwrites thatDraculawas founded on ""the fear and animosity his employer inspired in him"".[33][f]Miller contests this, describing Stoker's attitude towards him as ""adulation"".[35]

Historical figures have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula but there is no consensus. In a 1972 book,Raymond T. McNallyandRadu Florescupopularised the idea thatÁrmin Vámbérysupplied Stoker with information aboutVlad Dracula, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler.[36][g]Their investigation, however, found nothing about ""Vlad, Dracula, or vampires"" within Vámbéry's published papers,[38]nor in Stoker's notes about their meeting.[37]Miller calls the link to Vlad III ""tenuous"", indicating that Stoker incorporated a large amount of ""insignificant detail"" from his research, andrhetoricallyasking why he would omit Vlad III's infamous cruelty.[39][h]McNally additionally suggested in 1983 that the crimes ofElizabeth Báthoryinspired Stoker.[42][i]A book used by Stoker for research,The Book of Were-Wolves, does contain some information on Báthory, but Stoker never took notes from the short section devoted to her.[45]Miller and her co-authorRobert Eighteen-Bisangconcur that there is no evidence Báthory inspired Stoker.[46][j][k]

Prior to writing the novel, Stoker researched extensively, assembling over 100 pages of notes, including chapter summaries and plot outlines.[49][l]Stoker undertook some of his research at a library at Whitby in the summer of 1890 but most was done at theLondon Library.[51]The earliest dated notes are from 8 March 1890, comprising an outline of the novel's opening.[52]Joseph S. Beirman notes that it differs from the final novel ""in only a few details"": The Count and Harker are not given names. The wordvampireis not used explicitly, but it depicts the Count's possessive fury over Harker and a female who attempts ""to kiss him not on lips but throat"".[53][52]In February 1892, Stoker wrote a 27-chapter outline of the novel; according to Miller, ""all the key pieces of the jigsaw were in place"".[54]

Stoker's notes reveal other scrapped concepts. Bierman says that Stoker always intended to write an epistolary novel but originally set it in Styria instead of Transylvania.[53]Other concepts from the notes include a German professor called Max Windshoeffel confronting a ""Count Wampyr"" and one of the vampire hunters would have been slain by awerewolf.[55][m]Stoker biographer Barbara Belford notes evidence that Stoker intended to write adetective story, with a detective called Cotford and apsychical investigatorcalled Singleton.[57]

Stoker took the name Dracula from William Wilkinson's history of Wallachia and Moldavia (1820),[23]which he probably found in Whitby's public library while holidaying there in 1890.[58]Stoker copied the following footnote from the book: ""Dracula means devil. Wallachians were accustomed to give it as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous by courage, cruel actions or cunning"".[59]

Stoker stated that that it took him about three years to write the novel, and it is likely that he wrote most of the manuscript during his summer holidays inCruden Bay, Scotland from 1893 to 1896.[60]Stoker generally wrote in spare time from his duties as Irving's business manager, and the long gestation of the novel is indicative of the importance he placed on it.[61][62]

Early Stoker biographer Barbara Belford noted the novel looked ""shabby"" because of a last-minute title change;[63]the printer's copy of the typescript, with hand-written amendments, is titledThe Un-Dead.[64][n]The surviving typewritten publishing agreement was signed and dated 25 May 1897; Peter Beal ofSotheby'ssuggests its signing one day before the official publication date indicates that it was a formality.[66]To protect his copyright interest for adaptations,[o]Stoker organised a reading of his stage adaptation of the novel in the week before publication in theLyceum Theatre. A small group, primarily theatre staff, attended the reading, andEdith Craigplayed Mina.[68]

Bound in yellow cloth and titled in red letters,Draculawas published in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. It cost 6shillings.[69]Uncertainty exists around the exact date of publication, but it was probably published on 26 May 1897. Stoker wrote toWilliam Gladstonethat the novel would be released on the 26th.[70][p]Paul McAlduff writes that it was published ""on or about May 26"".[72]Eighteen-Bisang states it could have been published anywhere from late May to June 1897.[73]

Stoker's mother,Charlotte Stoker, enthused about the novel and predicted it would bring her son immense financial success. She was wrong: the novel, although reviewed well, failed to earn Stoker much money and did not establish his critical reputation until after his death.[74]For the first thousand sales ofDracula, Stoker earned no royalties.[5]Following serialisation by American newspapers,Doubleday & McClurepublished an American edition in 1899 with some textual changes.[63]A cheaper paperback version was published by Constable in 1901, but few copies have survived.[75]The text is around 15% shorter than the original but it is not known if Stoker made the amendments.[76]Since its publication,Draculahas never beenout of print.[77]

An edition of the novel edited by McNally and Florescu in 1979 was the first to includeDracula's ""missing chapter"", ""Dracula's Guest"".[78]Bram's widowFlorence Stokerincluded the chapter as a short story inDracula's Guest and Other Weird Tales(1914), two years after his death.[79]While some commentators have described the prose asDracula'sdiscarded first chapter, Clive Leatherdale contests this, arguing that the material was incorporated into the published novel.[80]

Draculais anepistolary novel.[81]Compared to other elements of the novel, critic David Seed writes that its epistolary structure has been neglected in analyses.[82]Critics note Stoker's decision to structure the novel this way may relate to a 19th-century trend of publishing diaries and travelogue accounts,[83]especially with Harker's account of the journey to Transylvania.[84]Seed writes that Harker's initial four chapters function as a ""miniaturised-pastiche-Gothic novel""—replacing Radcliffe's use of theApennine MountainsinThe Mysteries of Udolpho(1794) with theCarpathian MountainsofTransylvania[85]—and places this within the Gothic tradition ofintertextuality.[86]

David Seed argues that the structure only provides a narrative voice to Dracula's opponents,[87]while Miller writes that the ""collaborative narration"" reinforces the idea that Dracula must be defeated by the combined effort of his opponents.[83]Allison Case says Seed views that Dracula's absence generates tension by offering only ""tantalizing glimpses"" of his activities,[87]while literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that it highlights the power struggle between the vampire and his hunters.[88]Similarly, Allison Case views the structure as representing a power struggle between Mina and the male protagonists for ""narrative mastery"".[89]Seed notes that the narrative's style distances the reader from its plot. Dracula's journey on theDemeteris captured by the captain on thelogbook, then ""translated by the Russian consul, transcribed by a local journalist, and finally pasted by Mina into her journal"".[90]

Draculais an enduring work ofGothic literature,[91]with some critics locating it within the traditions ofIrish GothicorUrban Gothic.[92][93][94]John C. Tibbetts considersDraculaa prototype for later themes in the Gothic genre.[95]The novel is characteristically Gothic in its depiction of the supernatural, preoccupation with the past,[96]and embodying of the racial, gendered and sexual anxieties offin de siècleEngland.[97]Count Dracula generally represents these tensions: cultural criticJack Halberstamnotes that he is masculinised and feminised;[98]Jerrold E. Hogle highlights his attraction to both Jonathan and Mina, and his appearance as racially western and eastern.[99]Miller notes that the Count's physical characteristics were typical of Gothic villains during Stoker's lifetime, specifically citing his hooked nose,pallor, large moustache and thick eyebrows as influenced by his villainous predecessors.[100]Draculadeviates from other Gothic tales before it by firmly establishing its time as the modern era,[101]a point raised by one contemporary reviewer.[102]Writers of the mode were drawn to the Eastern Europe setting because travelogues presented it as a land of primitive superstitions.[103]

Modern critics frequently write thatDraculahad a mixed critical reception upon publication.[104]Carol Margaret Davison, for example, notes an ""uneven"" response from critics contemporary to Stoker.[69]John Edgar Browning, a scholar whose research focuses onDraculaand literary vampires, conducted a review of the novel's early criticism in 2012 and determined thatDraculahad been ""a critically acclaimed novel"".[105][q]Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu'sIn Search of Dracula(1972) mentions the novel's ""immediate success"".[107][r]Other works aboutDraculaalso published in 1972 concur; Gabriel Ronay says the novel was ""recognised by fans and critics alike as a horror writer's stroke of genius"",[108]and Anthony Masters mentions the novel's ""enormous popular appeal"".[109]Since the 1970s,Draculahas been the subject of significant academic interest; the novel has spawned many nonfiction books and articles, and has a dedicated peer-reviewed journal.[48]Publishers started creating editions aimed at classroom teaching in the 1980s, providing the novel alongside historical context and scholarly analysis.[110]The novel's complexity has permitted a flexibility of interpretation, with Anca Andriescu Garcia describing interest from scholars ofpsychoanalysis,postcolonialism, social class and the Gothic genre.[111]

Contemporary reviewers frequently compared the novel to other Gothic writers. Comparisons to novelistWilkie CollinsandThe Woman in White(1859) were especially common, owing to similarities in structure and style.[113][s]A review appearing inThe Booksellernotes that the novel could almost have been written by Collins,[114]and an anonymous review inSaturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Artwrote thatDraculaimproved upon the style of Gothic pioneerAnn Radcliffe;[115]Radcliffe was also referenced byThe Daily Mail,[t]which also highlightedThe Mysteries of Udolpho,Frankenstein(1818), andThe Fall of the House of Usher(1839).[112][116]Another anonymous writer described Stoker as ""the Edgar Allan Poe of the nineties"".[117]Other favourable comparisons to other Gothic novelists included theBrontë sistersandMary Shelley.[118][69]Arthur Conan Doylesent a letter to Stoker after readingDracula, writing: ""The old Professor is most excellent and so are the two girls. I congratulate you with all my heart for having written so fine a book.""[119]

Many of these early reviews were charmed by Stoker's treatment of the vampire myth.The Daily Telegraphcalled it the best vampire story ever written.The Daily Telegraph'sreviewer noted that while earlier Gothic works, likeThe Castle of Otranto, had kept the supernatural far away from the novelists' home countries,Dracula'shorrors occurred in foreign lands and at home in Whitby andHampstead Heath.[102]An Australian paper,The Advertiser, regarded the novel as simultaneouslysensationaland domestic.[120]One reviewer praised the ""considerable power"" of Stoker's prose and described it asimpressionistic. They were less fond of the parts set in England, finding the vampire suited better to tales set far away from home.[121]The British magazineVanity Fairfound Dracula's disdain for garlic unintentionally funny.[122]

Draculawas considered frightening. A review appearing inThe Manchester Guardianin 1897 praised its capacity to entertain, but concluded that Stoker erred in including so much horror.[123]Likewise,Vanity Fairopined that the novel was ""praiseworthy"" and absorbing, but could not recommend it to those who were not ""strong"".[122]Stoker's prose was commended as effective in sustaining the novel's horror by many publications.[124]A reviewer for theSan Francisco Wavecalled the novel a ""literary failure""; they elaborated that coupling vampires with frightening imagery, such as insane asylums and ""unnatural appetites"", made the horror too overt, and that other works in the genre, such asStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886), had more restraint.[125]

Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently discussed themes,[126]and modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality.[127][128]Across the novel's critical history, Miller writes that theorists have collectively argued that the Count breaks virtually ""every Victorian taboo"", includingnon-procreative sex(includingfellatio), transgressive sexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.[129]

Transgressiveor abnormal sexuality withinDraculais a broad topic. Some psychosexual critics explore the novel'sdisruptionof Victoriangender roles; within the Victorian context, Christopher Craft writes males had ""the right and responsibility of vigorous appetite"" while women were required to ""suffer and be still"".[130]Critics highlight the many places in which the novel disrupts these social mores: Jonathan Harker's excitement over the prospect of being penetrated;[131]Dracula's resulting anger and jealousy;[132]and Lucy's transformation into a sexually aggressive predator who drains ""vital fluid"".[133]Some critics, including professorCarol Senf, argue that the novel reflects anxiety about female sexual awakening as a threat to established norms.[134][135]

Draculacontains no overt homosexual acts, but homosexuality andhomoeroticismare elements discussed by critics.[136]Christopher Craft argues that the primary threat Dracula poses is that he will ""seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male"",[137]and reads Harker's excitement to submit as a proxy for ""an implicitly homoerotic desire"".[137]Victorian readers would have identified Dracula with sexual threat.[138]Some critics note that changes made to the 1899 American version of the text reinforce this subtext, wherein Dracula states he will feed on Harker.[139][140]Critics have variously linked these themes tohomoeroticletters Stoker wrote toWalt Whitman, his friendship withOscar Wilde,[141][u]his intensely emotional relationship with Irving, and contemporary rumours of Stoker's almostsexless marriage.[141][143][144]David J. Skalacknowledged the letters' subtext but cautioned against applyinganachronisticmodern sexual labels to Stoker.[145]

Many critics have suggested that the novel reveals a ""reactionaryresponse"" to theNew Womanphenomenon.[89]This is a late-Victorian term used to describe an emerging class of women with increased social and economic control over their lives.[146][147][148]Several critics describe the battle against Dracula as a fight for control over women's bodies.[149][150]Senf suggests that Stoker was ambivalent about the New Woman phenomenon,[151]while Signorroti argues that the novel's discomfort with female sexual autonomy reflects Stoker's dislike for the movement.[147]Both Lucy and Mina have characteristics associated with the New Woman;[152][v]Mina, who plays an important role in Dracula's defeat, repeatedly expresses contempt for the concept.[154][151]Senf notes that Lucy is punished for expressing dissatisfaction with her social position as a woman. After her transformation into a vampire, her defeat by the vampire hunters symbolises the re-establishment of ""male supremacy"".[155]

Dracula, and specifically the Count's migration to Victorian England, is frequently read as emblematic ofinvasion literature,[156]and a projection of fears about racial pollution.[157]In an influentialpostcolonialistanalysis,[158]Stephen Arata describes the novel's cultural context of mounting anxiety in Britain over the decline of theBritish Empire, the rise of otherworld powers, and a ""growing domestic unease"" over the morality of imperial colonisation.[159]Arata regards the novel as an instance of ""reverse colonisation"": fear of other races invading England and weakening its racial purity.[160]Patricia McKee writes that Dracula represents a negation of white culture while Mina represents ""pure whiteness"".[161]Dracula can be said to both kill white bodies and turn them into theracial Otherin death.[162]Some critics connect the racialisation of Dracula to his depiction as adegenerate criminal.[163][164]

Critics frequently identifyantisemiticthemes and imagery in the novel. Between 1891 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England increased sixfold, mainly due to antisemitic legislation andpogromsin eastern Europe.[165]Examples cited byJack Halberstamof antisemitic connections include Dracula's appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and ""lack of allegiance"" to one country.[166][w]Dracula's appearance resembles some other cultural depictions of Jews, such asFagininCharles Dickens'sOliver Twist(1838), andSvengaliofGeorge du Maurier'sTrilby(1895).[168]Jewish people were frequently described as parasites inVictorian literature; Halberstam highlights fears that Jews would spread diseases of the blood, and one journalist's description of Jews as ""Yiddish bloodsuckers"".[169]Daniel Renshaw writes that any antisemitism in the text is ""semi-subliminal""; he writes that Dracula is not Jewish but does reflect the 19th-century conception of Jewish people. Renshaw frames the novel more broadly as a general suspicion of all foreigners.[170]

The novel's depiction ofSlovaksandRomani peoplehas attracted limited scholarly attention.[171]In the novel, Harker describes the Slovaks as ""barbarians"" and their boats as ""primitive"", reflecting his imperialistic condescension towards other cultures.[172]Peter Arnds writes that the Count's control over the Romani and his abduction of young children evoke folk superstitions about Romani people stealing children, and that his ability to transform into a wolf is related to xenophobic beliefs about the Romani as animalistic.[173]Croley argues that Dracula's association with the Romani made him suspect in the eyes of Victorian England, where they were stigmatised owing to beliefs that they ate ""unclean meat"" and lived among animals.[174]

Draculais saturated with religious imagery. Christopher Herbert regards the novel as aparableabout conflict with an enemy who opposes Christ and Christianity.[175]Scholars discuss the novel's depiction of religion in relation to late Victorian anxieties about the threat which secularism, scientific rationalism and the occult posed to Christian beliefs and morality.[176]Stoker himself had a lifelong interest insupernaturalinquiry,[177]and Herbert writes that he mixes the supernatural and superstitious beliefs with religious elements, resulting in metaphors about moral uncleanness becoming literal elements of the text's ""occult reality"".[178]Herbert notes that theblood of Christis important to Christian ritual and imagery,[179]and Richard Noll notes that actual consumption of human blood is one of the oldestJudeo-Christiantaboos.[180]

The vampire hunters use many weapons—including Christian practices and symbols (prayer, crucifixes andconsecrated hosts), folkloric practices (garlic, staking and decapitation) and contemporary technology (typewriters,phonographs, telegrams, blood transfusions andWinchester rifles)—in their battle against Dracula.[181][182][183]Sanders argues that Stoker presents Christianity as a religion that can be instrumentalised and incorporated into scientific knowledge.[184]Herbert describes Van Helsing's ""Christian purification"" of Lucy as punitively addressing her promiscuity, and the resulting framing of Christianity as a means towards the ""eradication ofdeviancy"".[185]

Critics discuss the novel in relation toBritish rule in IrelandandIrish nationalism. Considerable debate exists over whetherDraculais an Irish novel; while it is largely set in England, Stoker was born in British-ruled Ireland and lived there for the first 30 years of his life.[186][187]Though born into aProtestantfamily, he was distanced from the religion's more conservative factions.[188]

Ralph Ingelbien notes that ""recognizably nationalist"" critics likeTerry EagletonandSeamus Deanefavoured readings of Dracula as ""a bloodthirsty caricature of the aristocratic landlord"" where the vampire represents the death offeudalism.[189]Bruce Stewart changes the focus to the lower classes,[189]suggesting Dracula and his Romani followers more likely represented violence byIrish National Land Leagueactivists.[190]Michael Valdez Moses compares Dracula to the disgracedCharles Stewart Parnell, leader of theIrish Home Rule movementfrom 1880 to 1882.[188][191]Robert Smart argues that Stoker's experience during theGreat Famine(1845–1852) influenced the novel,[192]with Stewart also noting this as historical context.[186]

Some critics discuss Count Dracula'snoble title. Literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that he is an aristocrat ""only in a manner of speaking"", citing his lack of servants, simple clothing, and lack of aristocratic hobbies. Moretti suggests that Dracula's blood thirst represents capital's desire to accumulate more capital.[193]More generally, Moretti argues the novel evinces cultural anxiety about foreigncapitalist monopoliesfunctioning as a return of feudalism.[194]Chris Baldick maintains this line of analysis, describing Dracula as an undead symbol of feudalism but concluding that the novel is more concerned with ""sexual and religious terrors"".[195]Mark Neocleous writes that Dracula symbolises the victory of the bourgeoisie over feudalism.[196]InDas Kapital,Karl Marxcompared thebourgeoisie's exploitation ofworkersto a vampire draining blood.[197]He uses vampires as a metaphor three times inDas Kapital, but these predate the writing ofDracula.[198]

Contagious disease was a topic of social and medical concern in late Victorian England.[199]Vampirism can represent disease, being both an initial infection and the resulting illness.[200]The novel characterises vampirism with terms fromsocial degeneration theory,[201]an 18th- and 19th-century social and biological concept arising from fear over the deterioration of the ""human condition"";[202]Victorian psychiatry, known then as ""alienism"";[203]and anthropology.[204]Theories of degeneracy propagated Victorian-era beliefs about poor moral character beingtransmissiblelike a pathogen.[201]Jack Halberstamwrites that Dracula and Renfield's relationship suggests that vampirism is ""a psychological disorder, an addictive activity"".[205]He notes that Renfield, and by association Dracula, is described by doctors using terminology more appropriate for describing animals.[205]Brian Aldisswrites that Count Dracula represents the initial disease while Renfield's madness is a symptom of advanced infection.[206]Halbertstam highlights that disease was frequently associated with Jews during the period.[207]Sexually transmitted infection, particularlysyphilis, is a frequent topic.[208]Literary critic Martin Willis writes that the novel depicts Victorian discourse over the origin, cause and treatment of disease, especially in the context of Lucy's treatment and eventual death.[200]"

She then recalls the closeness between herself and her brother Peter and how a piece of mischief so enraged their father that he beat his son in public. Peter then ran away from home and was last heard of leaving as a soldier to fight in India.

Visiting at Cranford(chapters 7–8) begins with Betty Barker's inviting the Cranford ladies to tea, at which social rules are broken but forgiven after all are persuaded to drink cherry brandy and Mrs Jamieson announces the coming stay of her elder brother's widow, Lady Glenmire. Tension follows the snobbery of Mrs Jamieson over this relationship, which is deflated when Lady Glenmire shows herself very approachable at a party given in her honour.

The Great Cranford Panic(chapters 9–11). The town is impressed by the arrival of the mysterious Signor Brunoni and attend his conjuring show. Gossip afterwards connects him with a spate of robberies that terrify the ladies. But he is later discovered lying ill in lodgings and turns out to be an ex-soldier named Samuel Brown. His wife then describes their time in India and how her little daughter was nursed to health there by a kind Englishman called Jenkyns. Mary Smith wonders whether this might have been Matty's lost brother and decides to make enquiries.

Stopped payment at Cranford(chapter 12–13). Mr Hoggins is called in to look after Signor Brunoni, where Lady Glenmire meets and becomes engaged to him. While out shopping, Matty hears the rumour that her bank may stop payment on its notes and, as an investor there, insists on paying in coin for a customer's purchase. The bankruptcy is confirmed next day.

Friends in need(chapter 14). Though Matty will soon be penniless and can no longer afford a maid, Martha refuses to leave. Instead she proposes marrying Jem Hearn and taking Matty in as her lodger. Miss Pole calls a meeting of the ladies and they agree to sacrifice some of their own income to support Matty, while getting Mary's father to pretend that it comes as a return on her investments.

A happy return to Cranford(chapters 15–16)
After a successful sale of her belongings, Matty's house is taken over by Jem and Martha. There she uses the parlour to trade in tea at Mary's suggestion. This arrangement does not last for long since Peter arrives after Mary has contacted him, having made a fortune as a planter in India. Matty is delighted and Peter makes sure she remains in the esteem of the ""Amazons"" by becoming a favourite among them as a peace-maker and teller of tall stories.

Elizabeth Gaskell had not done entirely with Knutsford with the publication ofCranford. Thomas Higgins, an 18th-century highwayman and former inhabitant of the town, was made the subject of ""The Squire’s Story"", published in the Christmas 1853 number ofHousehold Words, although it was there set in the fictitious Derbyshire town of Barford.[12]Then years later she made the arrival of thehoop skirtthe subject of an additional farcical episode in ""The Cage at Cranford"", published by Dickens in his new magazineAll the Year Roundin November 1863.[13]

Theatrical adaptations of the novel began at the turn of the century, the first few of which were produced in the US.[14]Among these were Alice Byington'sCranford Dames, a play in five scenes (New York, 1900),[15]andMarguerite Merington'sCranford: A Play, a three-act comedy set in the time ofWilliam IV, (New York 1905).[16]Some of the later British examples were merely dramatic episodes and included ""The Bank Breaks"" by Arthur Phosphor Mallam (1872–1948), based on chapters 13–15 (1912); Guy Pertwee's ""A Cranford Card Party"" (1913); Harry Brighouse's 'Cranford sketch', ""Followers"" (1915); and Amy M. Robertson's ""The Panic fromCranford"" (1930), based on chapter 10. 1930 also saw the tangential 'play for boys',Higgins, the Highwayman of Cranford, byRonald Gow.

In America the novel was adapted forNBCradio in 1946. Martyn Coleman's three-act play for theatre, first produced in 1951, was adapted for British television that year. Subsequently, a four-part television adaptation from the novel was broadcast byBBCin 1972. There was also a British musical based on the novel staged in 1975 and another broadcast byThames Televisionin 1976.[17]

In 2007 the five-part television series that appeared under the titleCranfordwas in reality elided with three other works by Gaskell:My Lady Ludlow,Mr. Harrison's ConfessionsandThe Last Generation in England. A sequel,Return to Cranford, was broadcast in 2009 in the UK and in 2010 in the US."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2160,The Expedition of Humphry Clinker,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expedition_of_Humphry_Clinker,"Matthew Bramble, his family and servants are traveling through England and Scotland. Although the primary motivation for the expedition is to restore the health of the gouty Matthew Bramble, each member of the family uses the excursion to achieve their ends. Leaving from Bramble's estate, Brambleton Hall, in Monmouthshire (there are frequent references to the family being Welsh, and the novel also contains individual Scottish and Irish characters), the family passes through many cities, making extended or significant stops at Gloucester,Bath, London, Harrogate,ScarboroughandEdinburgh, with a tour of theScottish Highlandsincluding a visit tothe country-houseof Smollett's brother, Sir James, ""on the banks of Lough-Lomond"".

The splenetic patriarch, Matthew Bramble, visits various natural spas to alleviate his health problems, and he corresponds primarily with his physician, Dr. Lewis. Through his letters and those of Jeremy, it is revealed that Bramble is misanthropic and something of a hypochondriac. Despite his frequent complaints, he is generally reasonable and extremely charitable to the people he meets on his travels as well as to his servants and wards back at home. His letters introduce and ridicule significant eighteenth century concerns such as medicine, the growth of urban life, class, the growth of the periodical press and thepublic sphere. His growing disillusionment at the changing moral and social landscape of Great Britain, particularly London, embodies his traditionalist perspective and reveals the absurdities of contemporary British culture.

His sister, Tabitha Bramble, is a foolish and cantankerous spinster who uses the expedition as an excuse to search for a husband. Through her correspondence with Mrs. Gwyllim, the house-keeper at Brambleton Hall, Tabitha reveals her selfishness and lack of generosity towards servants and the impoverished. Her social pretensions are rendered all the more comical by her frequent misunderstandings, misuse of common idioms, and atrocious spelling.

Tabitha's servant, Winifred or Win Jenkins, also corresponds with the servants at Brambleton Hall. As the only correspondent not related to Matthew Bramble, Ms. Jenkins offers a sympathetic and humorous perspective on the family and their travels. As a comic foil to Tabitha Bramble, Win Jenkins shares many of her misspellings andmalapropismsbut demonstrates considerably more common sense and intuition in her observation of the family. At London, she becomes infatuated with Humphry Clinker andMethodismboth.

Bramble's nephew, Jeremy Melford, is a young man looking for amusement. Corresponding primarily with Sir Watkin Phillips ofJesus College, Oxford, Jery also reflects upon issues of city life, class, and the growing public sphere, but often with a more progressive perspective than that of his rather traditional uncle. Despite his generously democratic views and his astute perceptions of the hypocrisy and absurdity of others, he is—as revealed through Bramble's letters—""hot-headed"" and prone to rash anger and impulsive defenses of perceived slights to his family honor, especially when it relates to his sister's interest in a stage actor below her status. His introduction into society as a young gentleman often occurs during his socializing at thecoffeehouse, a burgeoning social institution, especially in eighteenth century London. His study of the places and people of his journey includes the members of his family, whom he comically sketches for the reader. His accounts help provide insight into Matthew Bramble's character.

Bramble's niece, Lydia Melford, is trying to recover from an unfortunate romantic entanglement with a stage actor named Wilson, who is later revealed to be a gentleman named George Dennison. Her letters to Miss Letitia Willis at Gloucester reveal her struggles between familial duty and her affection for Wilson. She describes her secret communications with him, as well as her surprise encounter with the disguised Wilson in Bath. Lydia also reflects upon the wonders of city life, with astonishment and excitement. Lydia has spent most of her life at a boarding school for young women, so the expedition serves her as a debut into society (an important cultural phenomenon with a long literary tradition).

The eponymous character,Humphry Clinker, is anostler, a stableman at an inn, who does not make his first appearance until about a quarter of the way through the story. He is taken on by Matthew Bramble and family, while they are traveling toward London, after offending Tabitha and amusing Matthew Bramble. Humphry Clinker is a primarily foolish character whose good-natured earnestness earns him the esteem of Matthew Bramble. He is largely described through the letters of Matthew Bramble and Jeremy Melford and, despite his frequent misunderstandings, is presented as a talented worker and gifted orator, attracting a devoted following of parishioners during a brief oratorical stint in London. After various romantic interludes, Humphry suffers false imprisonment due to accusations of being a highway robber, though he retains the confident support of Matthew Bramble and his family. He is rescued and returned to his sweetheart, the maid Winifred Jenkins.  Eventually, it is discovered that Humphry is Mr. Bramble's illegitimate son from a relationship with a barmaid, during his wilder university days. The book ends in a series of weddings.

The novel was adapted into a radio script in four hour-long episodes by BBC Radio 4 and broadcast as the Classic Serial in 1992, repeated in 1994.   Timothy West played Squire Bramble. Dramatisation was by Scott Cherry.[2]

There was a later production in three hour-long episodes byBBC Radio 4and broadcast as the Classic Serial in 2008.  It was most recently repeated onBBC Radio 4 Extrain December 2023. Nigel Anthony played Squire Bramble. Dramatisation was by Yvonne Antrobus.

It was Smollett's third novel and met with less success than his two previous more picaresque tales.  The central character is a villainous dandy who cheats, swindles and philanders his way across Europe and England with little concern for the law or the welfare of others.[1]He is the son of an equally disreputable mother, and Smollett himself comments that ""Fathom justifies the proverb, 'What's bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh"".Sir Walter Scottcommented that the novel paints a ""complete picture of human depravity.""[2]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259,Twenty years after,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Years_After,"The action begins during the regency ofQueen Anne of Austria(term 1643–1651), withCardinal Mazarinas First Minister.D'Artagnan, who seemed to have a promising career ahead of him at the end ofThe Three Musketeers, has for twenty years remained a lieutenant, and seems unlikely to progress despite his ambition and the debt the Queen owes to him. He is summoned by Mazarin, who requires an escort; the French people detest Mazarin, and are on the brink of rebellion (La Fronde). D'Artagnan is sent to the Bastille to retrieve a prisoner, who turns out to be his former adversary, and then a friend, theComte de Rochefort.

Rochefort is brought to an audience with Mazarin, where he learns that the cause for his imprisonment was his refusal to serve Mazarin five years ago. When asked about reliable and resourceful men that Mazarin can employ, Rochefort tells Mazarin about the respect and awe d'Artagnan and his friends commanded in old times. Though Rochefort offers his services to Mazarin, he immediately refuses to watch over the imprisoned Duc de Beaufort, his personal friend. Mazarin orders the return of the prisoner to the Bastille, but on his way there Rochefort escapes.

Having determined that d'Artagnan is the man he seeks, Mazarin enters the chambers of the Queen to let her know that he has enlisted the man who had served her so well twenty years earlier (in adventures covered inThe Three Musketeers). The Queen, feeling guilty for having forgotten d'Artagnan's service, gives Mazarin a diamond ring to return to d'Artagnan, one which she had previously given him that d'Artagnan sold. The avaricious Mazarin merely uses the diamond to show d'Artagnan that he is once again to enter the Queen's service. He commissions d'Artagnan to go in search of his friends.

D'Artagnan is at a loss; he has completely lost touch with his friends, who have resumed their real names.Athos, the Comte de la Fère, had returned to his estate near Blois;Porthos, Monsieur du Vallon, had married a rich lawyer's widow; andAramisbecame a priest, the Abbé d'Herblay. Fortune intervenes when Planchet, his old servant, enters d'Artagnan's chambers, attempting to escape arrest for aiding the escape of Rochefort. Through Planchet, he locates Bazin, Aramis' old servant, nowbeadleat Notre Dame. Though Bazin is unwilling to help, d'Artagnan is able to find out, through an altar boy, that Bazin makes frequent visits to Noisy. D'Artagnan and Planchet go there, where they are set upon by a group who think them Frondeurs while outside the house ofMadame de Longueville. When this group is satisfied that d'Artagnan is not the man they seek, Aramis surprises Planchet by dropping onto his horse from the tree in which he had been hiding.

D'Artagnan finds that the former musketeer, who had thought of little other than being a priest, is now a priest who thinks of little other than being a soldier. Aramis is not willing to enter into Mazarin's service, however. D'Artagnan leaves but waits in hiding, suspecting that Aramis is both the Frondeur who had been sought earlier and the lover of Madame de Longueville. His suspicions are confirmed.

The visit to Aramis was not fruitless, as it yielded the address of Porthos. When d'Artagnan arrives at Porthos' estate he finds Mousqueton, who is overjoyed to meet d'Artagnan and Planchet. He finds that Porthos, despite his wealth and life spent in pursuit of amusement, is not happy. Porthos who envies nobles of high origin desires to become a baron, and with this bait d'Artagnan lures him into Mazarin's service.

D'Artagnan continues his search for Athos, whom he finds almost completely changed, set to live as an example to his ward, Raoul. Though Athos will not be enlisted into Mazarin's service, and indeed reveals that his sympathies lie against Mazarin, the two arrange to meet again in Paris. Athos wishes to bring Raoul there to help him to become a gentleman, and also to separate him fromLouise de la Vallière, a seven-years old girl living nearby, with whom Raoul is obsessively in love. In Paris, Athos visitsMadame de Chevreuse, an influential court politician and a former mistress of Aramis, with whom, under the name Marie Michon, Aramis had much communication inThe Three Musketeers. Athos reveals, discreetly, that Raoul is the son born of a chance encounter that Athos had with her, and through her gets a letter of recommendation for Raoul to join the army.

The scene then changes, to focus on theDuc de Beaufort, Mazarin's prisoner atVincennes, who finds a new jailer, Athos' servant, the silent Grimaud. Grimaud instantly makes himself disagreeable to the Duc, as part of an escape plot. Using messages passed to Rochefort using tennis balls, they arrange to have a meal onWhitsuntide, to which La Ramée, second in command of the prison, is invited. The escape is successful, but d'Artagnan and Porthos, on Mazarin's orders, are in pursuit.

After a race against time, and having defeated several adversaries along the way, Porthos and d'Artagnan find themselves on a dark road, surrounded, with swords crossed against adversaries equal to them, who are revealed to be Athos and Aramis. The four arrange to meet in Paris at the Place Royale. In a dramatic scene, the four friends come close to fighting each other, yet stop, reconcile, and renew their vows of friendship, which they value higher than any political alliances.

Raoul is travelling to join the army that wages a war against Spain under the command ofPrince de Condé. On the road, he saves the life of a young nobleman,Comte de Guiche, and the two become friends. Two days later, de Guiche saves Raoul's life in a skirmish with Spanish soldiers. After they defeat their enemies, they find a church servant close to death who requests the last rites. They help him to a nearby inn and find a traveling monk. When the monk does not seem inclined to perform this service, they have to force him to go to the inn.

At the confession, the man reveals that he has been the official executioner in the town of Béthune for many years, yet his only regret is that he took part in the execution of some noble woman,Milady de Winter, twenty years ago. The monk reveals himself as her son, John Francis de Winter, who calls himself Mordaunt after Charles I stripped him of all his titles. Mordaunt stabs the executioner. Grimaud, who is travelling to join Raoul, arrives to the inn just in time to learn, from the dying man, about the Mordaunt's existence and rushes back to warn Athos.

After joining the army of Prince de Condé, Raoul proves himself by assisting the Prince in interrogating a prisoner. The information that Conde acquires from the prisoner helps him to a decisive victory in theBattle of Lens. In a short time, 15-years old Raoul earns a reputation of a valiant soldier and becomes a Prince de Condé favorite.

d´Artagnan and Porthos help QueenAnne of Austria, the youngLouis XIVand Mazarin escape Paris after its citizens finally start a rebellion. The champion of the French populace and parliament,Pierre Broussel, is arrested, but then released when it becomes clear that his imprisonment has only served to stir the crowd up worse.  D´Artagnan meets the young king and watches over him as some Frondeurs - including Planchet, under a false name - who wanted to make sure that the king and queen were not about to escape, enter the king's bedroom demanding to see him.  Immediately after this, he contrives for all of the royal household to escape from Paris anyway, bluffing his way past Planchet at the gates (the two men retain their friendship despite their differing allegiances in this conflict).

Cardinal Mazarin sends d'Artagnan and Porthos to England with a message forOliver Cromwell, the leader of the British Parliament's army fighting King Charles I's, and orders them to stay there under Cromwell's command. At the same time,Queen Henrietta of Englandmeets the Musketeers' old English friend, Lord de Winter - a Royalist come to ask for French assistance for King Charles I of England, her husband, in theEnglish Civil Warand sends Athos and Aramis to England as well. So once again the two pairs of Musketeers find themselves on opposite sides. Departing for England, Mordaunt, who has been following Lord de Winter, sees him with Athos and Aramis and learns that they were participants of his mother's makeshift trial and execution twenty years ago.

King Charles I is betrayed by the leaders of the Scottish troops he commands and taken prisoner. Mordaunt, a favorite of Cromwell's, murders his uncle, Lord de Winter, Milady's brother-in-law, and attempts to lay hands on Athos and Aramis, when the duo are the last men to defend Charles I. However, Athos and Aramis are captured by d'Artagnan and Porthos who are fighting under Cromwell's troops. As soon as they have a chance to converse, Athos talks d'Artagnan and Porthos into helping to save Charles I. D'Artagnan and Porthos free their friends and start plotting to save the imprisoned king.

In the end, all their plans fail and Mordaunt turns to regicide, executingKing Charles Iafter d'Artagnan and the three former Musketeers have kidnapped London's official executioner in order to prevent this. D'Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell's secret residence, but in the course of a duel with d'Artagnan he escapes through a secret passage.

The Frenchmen and their servants leave England by ship, but Mordaunt gets aboard and blows it up.  Unfortunately for him, the Musketeers' servants had earlier discovered the explosives on board, roused their masters, and contrived to steal the only lifeboat before the ship can blow up, leaving Mordaunt aboard. Mordaunt escapes the blast, and pleads with the Musketeers to let him into their boat. With the exception of Athos, they contemptuously reject his appeals. Athos insists on saving him, but as he helps him into the boat, Mordaunt deliberately drags him under the water where they struggle and Mordaunt is killed.

Athos rejoins the others, stating: ""I had a son. I wanted to live."" This seems to confirm what d'Artagnan has long suspected, that the reason Athos's ward,Raoul de Bragelonnewhom he adopted after he was abandoned by his mother, bears such a resemblance to him is because he is Athos's natural son.[1]Athos further states that ""It was not me who killed him. It was fate.""

Once back in France, the four friends go separate ways. D'Artagnan and Porthos head to Paris through a different route from Athos and Aramis, knowing that Mazarin will not forgive their disobedience. Aramis and Athos reach Paris only to find out that their friends have not. After looking for D'Artagnan and Porthos, they learn the duo has been imprisoned by Mazarin in Rueil. Athos tries to persuade Queen Anne to free his friends, but is imprisoned as well.

After this, d'Artagnan manages to escape with Porthos and capture Mazarin. Mazarin is taken to one of Porthos's castles and he makes some concessions to the four friends in exchange for his freedom. These include making Porthos a baron and making d'Artagnan a captain of Musketeers.  Athos asks for nothing: Aramis asks for concessions towards himself and his friends in the Fronde.  These concessions are later accepted by Queen Anne, who finally realizes she has been rather ungrateful to d'Artagnan and his friends.

At the end of the novel, the first Fronde comes to an end and Mazarin, Queen Anne, and Louis XIV enter Paris. A riot takes place during which d'Artagnan accidentally kills Rochefort and Porthos kills Bonacieux (who in the earlier novel was d'Artagnan's landlord and an agent of Richelieu and is now a beggar and Frondist). At the end the four friends once again go their separate ways. D'Artagnan stays in Paris with Mazarin and Queen Anne; Athos returns to la Fère; Aramis returns to his abbey in Noisy le Sec; and Porthos returns to his castle to enjoy his baronage.

In 1967, the BBC aired a 16-episode television adaptation byAlexander BarontitledThe Further Adventures of the Musketeers, based onTwenty Years After,[3]withJoss Acklandas d'Artagnan,Jeremy Youngas Athos,Brian Blessedas Porthos andJohn Woodvineas Aramis. It was released on DVD in 2016.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Tom_Jones,_a_Foundling","The wealthy Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget are introduced in their estate inSomerset. Allworthy returns fromLondonafter an extended business trip and finds an abandoned baby sleeping in his bed. He summons his housekeeper, Mrs Deborah Wilkins, to take care of the child. After searching the nearby village Mrs Wilkins is told about Jenny Jones, the young servant of a schoolmaster and his wife, as the most likely person to have committed the deed. Jenny is brought before the Allworthys and admits being the one who put the baby in the bed, but refuses to reveal the father's identity. Mr. Allworthy removes Jenny to a place where her reputation will be unknown and tells Bridget to raise the boy, whom he names Thomas, in his household.

Two brothers, Dr Blifil and Captain Blifil, regularly visit the Allworthy estate. The doctor introduces the captain to Bridget in the hope of marrying into Allworthy's wealth. The couple soon marries. After the marriage, Captain Blifil begins to show a coldness to his brother, who eventually feels obliged to leave the house for London. He does, and later dies ""of a broken heart."" Captain Blifil and Bridget start to grow cool towards one another, and the former is found dead fromapoplexyone evening after taking his customary evening stroll before dinner. By then, he has fathered a boy who grows up with the bastard Tom. Captain Blifil's son, known as Master Blifil, is a jealous boy who conspires against Tom.

Tom grows into a youth. He tends to be closer friends with the servants and gamekeepers than with members of the gentry. He is close friends with Black George, who is the gamekeeper. His first love is Molly, Black George's second daughter. She throws herself at Tom, who then feels obliged to offer her his protection after learning that she is pregnant. However, Tom later realizes that Molly is somewhat promiscuous. He then falls in love with a neighbouring squire's daughter, Sophia Western. Tom and Sophia confess their love for each other after he breaks his arm rescuing her. Tom's status as a bastard causes Sophia's father and Allworthy to disapprove their love.[a]

Squire Allworthy falls ill and is convinced that he is dying. His family and servants gather around his bed as he disposes of his wealth. He gives a favourable amount of it to Tom, which displeases Master Blifil. Tom does not care about what he has been given, since his only concern is Allworthy's health. Allworthy's health improves and he learns that he will live. Tom is so excited that he gets drunk and eventually fights with Master Blifil. Meanwhile, Bridget dies in London. Wanting to conceal her love for Tom, Sophia gives a majority of her attention to Blifil when the three of them are together. This leads to Sophia's aunt, Mrs Western, believing that Sophia and Blifil are in love. Squire Western wants Sophia to marry Blifil to gain property from the Allworthy estate. Blifil learns of Sophia's affection for Tom and is angry. Blifil tells Allworthy that, on the day he almost died, Tom was out drinking and celebrating his coming death. This leads Tom to be banished.

Tom's banishment seems to ensure that Sophia will be forced to marry Blifil, whom she finds odious, so she flees to avoid that fate. Meanwhile, expelled from Allworthy's estate, Tom begins his adventures across Britain, eventually ending up in London. En route, he meets a barber, Partridge, who was banished from town because he was thought to be Tom's father. He becomes Tom's faithful companion in the hope of restoring his reputation. During their journey, they end up at an inn. While they are there, a lady and her maid arrive. An angry man arrives, and the chambermaid points him in the direction that she thinks he needs to go. He bursts in on Tom and Mrs Waters, a woman whom Tom rescued, in bed together. The man, however, was looking for Mrs Fitzpatrick and leaves. Sophia and her maid arrive at the same inn, and Partridge unknowingly reveals the relationship between Tom and Mrs Waters. Sophia leaves with Mrs Fitzpatrick, who is her cousin, and heads for London. They arrive at the home of Lady Bellaston, followed by Tom and Partridge. Eventually, Tom says that his true love is for Sophia and no one else. Tom ends up getting into a duel with Mr Fitzpatrick, which leads to his imprisonment.

Eventually, the secret of Tom's birth is revealed after a brief scare involving Mrs Waters. Mrs Waters is really Jenny Jones, Tom's supposed mother, and Tom fears that he committedincest. This, however, is not the case, as Tom's mother is in fact Bridget, who conceived him with a man who died before he was born. Tom is thus Squire Allworthy's nephew. After finding out about the intrigues of Blifil, who is Tom's half-brother, Allworthy decides to bestow most of his inheritance on Tom. After Tom's true parentage is revealed, he and Sophia marry, as Squire Western no longer harbours any misgivings about Tom marrying his daughter. Sophia bears Tom a son and a daughter, and the couple live on happily with the blessings of Squire Western and Squire Allworthy.

The highly visible narrator is a central feature ofTom Jones. Each book begins with a prefatory chapter directly addressing the reader, and the narrator provides a continuous commentary on characters and events.Lady Bellaston, for instance, is widely believed to have been inspired by the real life character ofEtheldreda Townshend.[7]According toWayne C. Booth, the reader's relationship with the narrator is something like a subplot. The reader becomes more attached to the narrator over the course of the book, culminating in a heartfelt farewell.[8]

Fielding presents a panorama of contemporary British life, drawing characters from many different classes and occupations. ButIan Wattargues inThe Rise of the Novelthat Fielding did not aim at the ""realism of presentation"" of lifelike detail and psychology practised by authors such asRichardson. Watt claims that Fielding was more focused on the ""realism of assessment,"" the way in which the novel engages a broad range of topics with intelligence and ""a wise assessment of life.""[9]

The main theme of the novel is the contrast between Tom Jones's good nature, flawed but eventually corrected by his love forvirtuousSophia Western, and his half-brother Blifil'shypocrisy. Secondary themes include several other examples of virtue (especially that of Squire Allworthy), hypocrisy (especially that of Thwackum) andvillainy(for example, that of Mrs Western and Ensign Northerton), sometimes tempered by repentance (for instance Square and Mrs WatersnéeJones).

Both introductory chapters to each book and interspersed commentary introduce a long line of further themes. For instance, introductory chapters dwell extensively on bad writers and critics, quite unrelated to the plot but apologetic to the author and the novel itself; and authorial commentary on several characters shows strong opposition toMethodism, calling itfanaticalandheretical, and falsely implying an association between Methodism and hypocrites such as the younger Blifil.

The novel takes place against the backdrop of theJacobite rising of 1745. Characters take different sides over the rebellion, which was an attempt to restoreRoman Catholicismas theestablished religionof England and to undo theGlorious Revolution. At one point Sophia Western is even mistaken forJenny Cameron, the supposed lover ofBonnie Prince Charlie. Good-natured characters are often moderatelyloyalistandAnglican, or even supporters of theHouse of Hanover, while ill-natured characters (Mrs Western) or mistaken ones (Partridge) can beJacobites, or (like Squire Western) anti-Hanoverian.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4085,The Adventures of Roderick Random,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Roderick_Random,"The novel is set in the 1730s and 1740s and tells the life story (in the first person) of Roderick ""Rory"" Random, who was born to a Scottish gentleman and a lower-class woman and is thus shunned by his father's family. His mother dies soon after giving birth and his father is driven mad with grief. Random's paternal grandfather coerces a local school master into providing free education for the boy, who becomes popular with his classmates (some of whom he encounters again in subsequent adventures) and learns Latin, French, Italian and ancient Greek. The language accomplishments are despite, rather than because of, the abusive tutor who oppresses Random at every opportunity. Finally Random is cast out after the tutor exacts revenge for one of Random's escapades and denounces him to his grandfather. With none of his paternal family willing to assist him in any way, Random relies on his wits and the occasional support of his maternal uncle, Tom Bowling.

The naive Random then embarks on a series of adventures and misadventures, visitinginter alia,London,Bath,France, theWest Indies, West Africa andSouth America. With little money to support himself, he encounters malice, discrimination andsharpersat every turn. His honest and trustworthy character and medical skills do however win him a few staunch friends. Roderick spends much of the novel trying to attract the attention of various wealthy women he meets, so that he can live comfortably and take up his rightful entitlement as a gentleman. To that end he poses as a nobleman several times, including once while he is in France. Roderick and his companion Hugh Strap end up serving twice on British ships, once on aprivateerand once on a warship after beingpress-ganged. The novel ends happily when Random is reunited with his wealthy father in Argentina. He inherits some funds immediately, enabling him to marry the lovely Narcissa without the consent of herguardianbrother.

Typical of a picaresque novel, there is a wide range of characters but few central ones.

Random's maternal uncle, he is a sailor who attempts to support Random as best as he can between voyages. His conversation is laced with nautical terminology.

The character of ""Captain Whiffle"" is said to be modelled onLord Harry Powlett, who became 6th Duke of Bolton.[1]

Smollett offers a vicious portrayal of hypocrisy, greed, deceit and the snobbery peculiar to the times, especially among the upper and middle classes. He exposes the brutality, incompetence and injustice of theRoyal Navyat theBattle of Cartagenain 1741 and in relation to preferment, promotion and medical treatment. The novel embraces common 18th century topics such asprivateering, slavery, prostitution,dowries, homosexuality,debtor's prison(the Marshalsea), political and arts patronage, the clergy, the practice of medicine, and corruption. Smollett experienced many of these first-hand and portrays them with a candid vigour.

Throughout the novel, Random is referred to by the author and others as a  ""North Briton"". The relatively recentAct of Unionbetween England and Scotland in 1707 was still controversial."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98,A Tale of Two Cities,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities,"Dickens opens the novel with a sentence that has become famous:

In 1775,Jerry Cruncherflags down the nightly mail-coach en route from London toDover. Cruncher is an employee of Tellson's Bank in London; he carries a message forJarvis Lorry, one of the bank's managers. Lorry sends Jerry back with the cryptic response ""Recalled to Life"", referring toAlexandre Manette, a French physician who has been released from theBastilleafter an 18-year imprisonment. On arrival in Dover, Lorry meets Dr. Manette's daughterLucieand her governess,Miss Pross. Believing her father to be dead, Lucie faints at the news that he is alive. Lorry takes her to France for a reunion.

In the Paris neighbourhood of theFaubourg Saint-Antoine, Dr. Manette has been given lodgings by his former servant Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese, the owners of a wine shop. Lorry and Lucie find him in a small garret where he spends much of his time distractedly and obsessively making shoes – a skill he learned in prison. Lorry and Lucie take him back to England.

In 1780, FrenchémigréCharles Darnayis on trial in London for treason against the British Crown. The key witnesses against him are two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly. Barsad claims that he would recognise Darnay anywhere, but Darnay's lawyer points out that his colleague in court,Sydney Carton, bears a strong resemblance to the prisoner. With Barsad's testimony thus undermined, Darnay is acquitted.

In Paris, the hated and abusiveMarquis St. Evrémondeorders his carriage driven recklessly fast through the crowded streets, hitting and killing a child. The Marquis throws a coin to the child's father, Gaspard, to compensate him for his loss; as the Marquis drives on, the coin is flung back into the carriage.

Arriving at his countrychâteau, the Marquis meets Darnay, his nephew and heir. Out of disgust with his aristocratic family, the nephew has replaced his surname (St. Evrémonde) with Darnay, an anglicised version of mother's maiden name (D'Aulnais). He despises the Marquis' views that ""Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery ... will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof [looking up to it] shuts out the sky.""[7]That night, Gaspard creeps into the château and stabs and kills the Marquis in his sleep. He avoids capture for nearly a year, but is eventually hanged in the nearby village.

In London, Carton confesses his love to Lucie, but quickly recognises that she does not love him. He nevertheless promises to ""embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you"".[8]Darnay asks for Dr. Manette's permission to wed Lucie, and he agrees. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and lineage to Dr. Manette, facts that Manette had asked him to withhold until that day. The unexpected revelation causes Dr. Manette to revert to his obsessive shoemaking. He returns to sanity before their return from honeymoon, and the whole incident is kept secret from Lucie.

As the years pass, Lucie and Charles raise a family in England: a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. Lorry finds a second home with them. Carton, though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie.

In Paris in July 1789, the Defarges help to lead thestorming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal tyranny. Defarge enters Dr. Manette's former cell and searches it thoroughly. Throughout the countryside, local officials and other representatives of the aristocracy are slaughtered, and the St. Evrémonde château is burned to the ground.

In 1792, Lorry travels to France to save important documents stored at Tellson's Paris branch from the chaos of theFrench Revolution. Darnay receives a letter from Gabelle, one of his uncle's former servants who has been imprisoned by the revolutionaries, pleading for Darnay (now the Marquis St. Evrémonde) to help secure his release. Without telling his family or revealing his position as the new marquis, Darnay also sets out for Paris.

On his way to Paris, Darnay is arrested as a returning emigrated aristocrat and jailed inLa Force Prison. Hoping to be able to save him, Dr. Manette, Lucie and her daughter, Jerry, and Miss Pross all move to Paris and take up lodgings near those of Lorry.

Fifteen months later Darnay is finally tried, and Dr. Manette – viewed as a popular hero after his long imprisonment in the Bastille – testifies on his behalf. Darnay is acquitted and released, but is re-arrested later that day.

While running errands with Jerry, Miss Pross is amazed to run into her long-lost brother Solomon. Now posing as a Frenchman, he is an employee of the revolutionary authorities and one of Darnay's gaolers. Carton also recognises him – as Barsad, one of the spies who tried to frame Darnay at his trial in 1780. Solomon is desperate to keep his true identity hidden, and Carton blackmails him into helping with a play by threatening to denounce him as an English spy.

Darnay's retrial the following day is based on new denunciations by the Defarges and on a manuscript that Defarge had found in Dr. Manette's Bastille cell. Defarge reads the manuscript to the tribunal. In it, Dr. Manette had recorded that his imprisonment was at the hands of the Evrémonde brothers (Darnay's father and uncle) after he had tried to report their crimes. Darnay's uncle had kidnapped and raped a peasant girl. Her brother, first hiding his remaining younger sister, had gone to confront the uncle, who ran him through with his sword. In spite of the best efforts of Dr. Manette, both the elder sister and the brother died. Dr. Manette's manuscript concludes by denouncing the Evrémondes, ""them and their descendants, to the last of their race.""[9]The jury takes that as irrefutable proof of Darnay's guilt, and he is condemned to die by theguillotinethe next afternoon.

In the Defarges' wine shop, Carton discovers that Madame Defarge is the surviving sister of the peasant family, and he overhears her planning to denounce Lucie and her daughter. He visits Lorry and warns him that Lucie and her family must be ready to flee the next day. He extracts a promise that they will be waiting for him at 2 pm, ready to leave the instant he returns.

Shortly before the executions are due to begin, Carton puts his plan into effect. With Barsad's reluctant assistance, he gains access to Darnay's prison cell. Carton drugs his lookalike and trades places with him. Then he has Barsad carry Darnay out to the carriage, where Lorry and the family are awaiting Carton. They flee to England with Darnay.

Meanwhile, Madame Defarge goes to Lucie's lodgings, hoping to apprehend her and her daughter. There she finds Miss Pross, who is waiting for Jerry so they can follow the family out of Paris. The two women struggle and Madame Defarge's pistol discharges, killing her and permanently deafening Miss Pross.

As Carton waits to board thetumbrilthat will take him to his execution, he is approached by another prisoner, a seamstress. Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick and that the worries of their lives will not follow them into ""the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered."" A final prophetic thought runs through his mind in which he visualises a better future for the family and their descendants.

Dickens closes with Carton's final prophetic vision as he contemplates the guillotine:[10]

Lady Honoria Dedlock, the beneficiary of one of the wills, lives with her husband, Sir Leicester Dedlock, at his estate at Chesney Wold. While listening to the reading by Mr Tulkinghorn, the familysolicitor, of an affidavit, Lady Dedlock recognises the handwriting on the copy. The sight affects her so much she almost faints, which Mr Tulkinghorn notices and investigates. He traces the copyist, a pauper known only as ""Nemo"", inLondon. Nemo has recently died, and the only person to identify him is a street-sweeper, a poor homeless boy named Jo, who lives in a particularly grim and poverty-stricken part of the city known as Tom-All-Alone's.

Esther Summerson is raised by the harsh Miss Barbary, who tells her, ""Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers."" After Miss Barbary dies, John Jarndyce becomes Esther'sguardianand assigns ""Conversation"" Kenge, a Chancery lawyer, to take charge of her future. After attending school for six years, Esther moves in with Jarndyce at his home, Bleak House. Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards, his cousins Richard Carstone and Ada Clare. They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue inJarndyce and Jarndyce; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will, and the two wills conflict.

Richard and Ada soon fall in love, but though Jarndyce does not oppose the match, he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession. Richard first tries a career in medicine, and Esther meets Allan Woodcourt, a physician, at the house of Richard's tutor. When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution ofJarndyce and Jarndyce, Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls ""thefamily curse."" Richard decides to change his career to law, then later switches again and spends the remainder of his funds tobuy a commission as a military officer.

Lady Dedlock—disguised as her maid, Mademoiselle Hortense—pays Jo to take her to Nemo's grave. Meanwhile, Mr Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock has a secret which could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester and watches her constantly, even enlisting the real Hortense to spy on her. He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town, to eliminate anything that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks. Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and later talks with her at Chesney Wold.

Lady Dedlock discovers that Esther is her own child: unknown to Sir Leicester, before she married, Honoria had had a lover, Captain Hawdon (Nemo), and bore a daughter by him, who she had believed was dead. The daughter, Esther, was brought up by Honoria's sister, Miss Barbary. Esther becomes sick (possibly withsmallpox, since it severely disfigures her) from Jo. Lady Dedlock waits until she has recovered before telling her the truth. Though the two women are happy to be reunited, Lady Dedlock tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again.

Upon recovery, Esther finds that Richard, having failed at several professions, has ignored Jarndyce's advice and is trying to pushJarndyce and Jarndyceto conclusion in his and Ada's favour, and as a result has fallen out with Jarndyce. In the process, Richard loses all his money and declines in health. He and Ada have secretly married, and Ada is pregnant. Esther has her own romance when Mr Woodcourt returns to England, having survived a shipwreck, and he continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement. However, Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian, the much older Jarndyce.

Hortense and Mr Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock's past. After a confrontation with Mr Tulkinghorn, Lady Dedlock flees her home, leaving a note apologising to Sir Leicester for her conduct. Mr Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense, who is no longer of any use to him. He is shot through the heart, and suspicion falls on Lady Dedlock. Sir Leicester, discovering his lawyer's death and his wife's confession and flight, suffers a catastrophicstroke, but he manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return.

Inspector Bucket, who has previously investigated several matters related toJarndyce and Jarndyce, accepts Sir Leicester's commission to find Lady Dedlock. He initially suspects her of the murder but is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense's guilt. He requests Esther's help to find her mother. Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband's forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion, and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover, Captain Hawdon. Esther and Inspector Bucket find her there.

Progress inJarndyce and Jarndyceseems to take a turn for the better when a later will is found, which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada. Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther, who becomes engaged to Mr Woodcourt. They go to Chancery to find Richard. On their arrival, they learn that the case ofJarndyce and Jarndyceis finally over, because the costs oflitigationhave entirely consumed the estate. Richard collapses, and blood in his mouth makes it evident he is in the last stages oftuberculosis. He apologises to Jarndyce and dies. Jarndyce takes in Ada and her child, a boy whom she names Richard. Esther and Mr Woodcourt marry and live in aYorkshirehouse which Jarndyce gives to them. The couple later raise two daughters.

Many of the novel's subplots focus on minor characters. One such subplot is the hard life and happy, though difficult, marriage of Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop. Another plot focuses on George Rouncewell's rediscovery of his family, and his reunion with his mother and brother.

Although not a character,Jarndyce and Jarndyceis a vital part of the novel. It is believed to have been inspired by a number of real-life Chancery cases involving wills, including those ofCharles DayandWilliam Jennens,[8]and ofCharlotte Smith's father-in-law,Richard Smith.[9]

Much criticism ofBleak Housefocuses on its unique narrative structure: it is told both by a third-person omniscient narrator and a first-person narrator (Esther Summerson). The omniscient narrator speaks in the present tense and is a dispassionate observer. Esther Summerson tells her own story in the past tense (like David inDavid Copperfieldor Pip inGreat Expectations), and her narrative voice is characterised by modesty, consciousness of her own limits, and willingness to disclose to us her own thoughts and feelings. These two narrative strands never quite intersect, though they do run in parallel. Nabokov felt that letting Esther tell part of the story was Dickens's ""main mistake"" in planning the novel.[23]Alex Zwerdling, a scholar from Berkeley, after observing that ""critics have not been kind to Esther"", nevertheless thought Dickens's use of Esther's narrative ""one of the triumphs of his art"".[24]

Esther's portion of the narrative is perceived by some scholars[who?]as an interesting case study of the Victorian ideal of feminine modesty. She introduces herself thus: ""I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages, for I know I am not clever"" (chap. 3). This claim is almost immediately belied by the astute moral judgement and satiric observation that characterise her pages. In the same introductory chapter, she writes: ""It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself! As if this narrative were the narrative ofmylife! But my little body will soon fall into the background now"" (chap. 3). This does not turn out to be true.

For most readers and scholars, the central concern ofBleak Houseis its indictment of the English Chancery court system. Chancery or equity courts were one half of the English civil justice system, existing side-by-side with law courts. Chancery courts heard actions having to do with wills and estates, or with the uses of private property. By the mid-nineteenth century, English law reformers had long criticised the delays of Chancery litigation, and Dickens found the subject a tempting target. He already had taken a shot at law-courts and that side of the legal profession in his 1837 novelThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick CluborThe Pickwick Papers. Scholars, such as the English legal historian SirWilliam Searle Holdsworth, in his 1928 series of lectures,[25]have made a plausible case for treating Dickens's novels, andBleak Housein particular, as primary sources illuminating the history of English law.

Dickens said in the preface to the book edition ofBleak Housethat he had ""purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things"". And some remarkable things do happen: One character, Krook, smells of brimstone and eventually dies ofspontaneous human combustion. This was highly controversial. The nineteenth century saw the increasing triumph of the scientific worldview. Scientifically inclined writers, as well as physicians and scientists, rejected spontaneous human combustion as legend or superstition. When the instalment ofBleak Housecontaining Krook's demise appeared, the literary criticGeorge Henry Lewesaccused Dickens of ""giving currency to a vulgar error"".[26]Dickens vigorously defended the reality of spontaneous human combustion and cited many documented cases, as well as his own memories of coroners' inquests that he had attended when he had been a reporter. In the preface of the book edition ofBleak House, Dickens wrote: ""I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable Spontaneous Combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received.""

George GissingandG. K. Chestertonare among those literary critics and writers who considerBleak Houseto be the best novel that Dickens wrote. As Chesterton put it: ""Bleak Houseis not certainly Dickens's best book; but perhaps it is his best novel"".Harold Bloom, in his bookThe Western Canon, considersBleak Houseto be Dickens's greatest novel. Daniel Burt, in his bookThe Novel 100: A Ranking of the Greatest Novels of All Time, ranksBleak Housenumber 12.

The house namedBleak HouseinBroadstairsis not the original. Dickens stayed with his family at this house (then called Fort House) for at least one month every summer from 1839 until 1851. However, there is no evidence that it formed the basis of the fictional Bleak House, particularly as it is so far from the location of the fictional house.

The house is on top of the cliff on Fort Road and was renamed Bleak House after his death, in his honour.[citation needed]It is the only four storey grade II listed mansion in Broadstairs.

Dickens locates the fictional Bleak House in St Albans, Hertfordshire, where he wrote some of the book. An 18th-century house in Folly Lane, St Albans, has been identified as a possible inspiration for the titular house in the story since the time of the book's publication and was known as Bleak House for many years.[27]

In the late nineteenth century, actressFanny Janauschekacted in a stage version ofBleak Housein which she played both Lady Dedlock and her maid Hortense.  The two characters never appear on stage at the same time. In 1876 John Pringle Burnett's play,Jofound success in London with his wife,Jennie Leeplaying Jo, thecrossing-sweeper.[28]In 1893,Jane Coombsacted in a version ofBleak House.[29]

A 1901 short film,The Death of Poor Joe, is the oldest known surviving film featuring aCharles Dickenscharacter (Jo inBleak House).[30]

In the silent film era,Bleak Housewas filmedin 1920and 1922. The latter version featuredSybil Thorndikeas Lady Dedlock.[31]

In 1928, a short film made in the UK in thePhonofilmsound-on-film process starredBransby Williamsas Grandfather Smallweed.[32]

In 1998,BBC Radio 4broadcast a radio adaptation of five hour-long episodes, starringMichael Kitchenas John Jarndyce.[33]

TheBBChas produced three television adaptations ofBleak House. The first serial,Bleak House, was broadcast in 1959 in eleven half-hour episodes.[34]The serial survives. The secondBleak House, starringDiana RiggandDenholm Elliott, aired in 1985 as an eight-part series.[35]In 2005, the thirdBleak Housewas broadcast in fifteen episodes starringAnna Maxwell Martin,Gillian Anderson,Denis Lawson,Charles Dance, andCarey Mulligan.[36]It won aPeabody Awardthat same year because it ""created 'appointment viewing,' soap-style, for a series that greatly rewarded its many extra viewers.""[37]

Charles Jefferyswrote the words for andCharles William Gloverwrote the music for songs called ""Ada Clare""[38]and ""Farewell to the Old House"",[39]which are inspired by the novel.

Anthony Phillipsincluded a piece entitled ""Bleak House"" on his 1979progressive rockrelease,Sides. The form of the lyrics roughly follows the narrative of Esther Summerson, and is written in her voice.[40]

Like most Dickens novels,Bleak Housewas published in 20 monthly instalments, each containing 32 pages of text and two illustrations byPhiz(the last two being published together as a double issue). Each cost one shilling, except for the final double issue, which cost two shillings.[citation needed]

He initially considers the transformation to be temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of hismetamorphosis. Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which he characterizes as being full of ""always changing, never enduring human exchanges that don't ever become intimate"".[4]He sees his employer as adespotand would quickly quit his job if he were not his family's sole breadwinner and working off hisbankruptfather's debts. While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor's unexcused absence. Gregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees the apartment. Gregor's family is horrified, and his father drives him back towards his room. Gregor is injured when he tries to force himself through the doorway (which is too narrow for him) but gets unstuck when his father shoves him through.

With Gregor's unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which she finds Gregor only likes if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around on the floor, walls, and ceiling. Upon discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space. She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything, except the sofa under which Gregor hides whenever anyone comes in. He finds their actions deeply distressing, fearing that he might forget his past as a human, and desperately tries to save a particularly loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it. When Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in his back and severely wounds him.

Gregor suffers from his injuries and eats very little. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and increasingly begin to neglect him, and his room begins to be used for storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor's door open in the evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male tenants, since they are not told about Gregor. One day, thecharwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and before she leaves, neglects to close his door fully. Attracted by Grete's violin-playing in the living room, Gregor crawls out and is spotted by the unsuspecting tenants, who complain about the apartment's unhygienic conditions and say they are leaving, will not pay anything for the time they have already stayed, and may take legal action. Grete, who is tired of taking care of Gregor and realizes the burden his existence puts on each member of the family, tells her parents they must get rid of ""it"" or they will all be ruined. Gregor, understanding that he is no longer wanted, laboriously makes his way back to his room and dies of starvation before sunrise. His body is discovered by the charwoman, who alerts his family and then disposes of the corpse. The relieved and optimistic father, mother, and sister all take the day off work. They travel by tram into the countryside and make plans to move to a smaller apartment to save money. During the short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, despite the hardships that have brought some paleness to her face, Grete has grown up into a pretty young lady with a good figure and they think about finding her a husband."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre,"Jane Eyreis divided into 38 chapters. It was originallypublished in three volumesin the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.

The second edition was dedicated toWilliam Makepeace Thackeray.

The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign ofGeorge III(1760–1820).[a]It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time asgovernessat Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.

The five stages of Jane's life are as follows:

Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane wasorphanedseveral years earlier when her parents died oftyphus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.
One day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only son, Jane is locked in thered roomin which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the ""ambiguous relationship between parents and children"" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.[9]She is subsequently attended to by the kindlyapothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed happily supports.

Mrs Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr Brocklehurst, the director of Lowood Institution, acharity schoolfor girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs Reed cautions Mr Brocklehurst that Jane has a ""tendency to deceit"", which he interprets as Jane being a liar. Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs Reed and declares that she'll never call her ""aunt"" again. Jane also tells Mrs Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs Reed is hurt badly by these words but has neither the courage nor the tenacity to show it.[10]

At Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails and receives a lashing as a result. Later Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges.

In due course Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops herslate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane's self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrongdoing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane's two main role models who positively guide her development despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.

The 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when atyphusepidemic strikes; Helen dies ofconsumptionin Jane's arms. When Mr Brocklehurst's maltreatment of the pupils is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr Brocklehurst's harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1400,Great Expectations,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations,"The book includes three ""stages"" of Pip's expectations.

Philip ""Pip"" Pirrip is a seven-year-old orphan who lives with his hot-tempered older sister and her kindly blacksmith husband Joe Gargery on the coastal marshes ofKent. On Christmas Eve 1812,[14]Pip visits the graves of his parents and siblings. There, he unexpectedly encounters an escaped convict who threatens to kill him if he does not bring back food and tools. Pip steals a file from among Joe's tools and a pie and brandy meant for Christmas dinner, which he delivers to the convict.

That evening, Pip's sister is about to look for the missing pie when soldiers arrive and ask Joe to mend some shackles. Joe and Pip accompany them into the marshes to recapture the convict, who is fighting with another escaped convict. The first convict confesses to stealing food, clearing Pip.[15]

A few years later,Miss Havisham, a wealthy and reclusive spinster who lives in dilapidated Satis House wearing her old wedding dress after having been jilted at the altar, asks Mr Pumblechook, a relative of the Gargerys, to find a boy to visit her. Pip visits Miss Havisham and falls in love with Estella, her adopted daughter. Estella is aloof and hostile to Pip, which Miss Havisham encourages. During one visit, another boy picks a fist fight with Pip, where Pip easily gains the upper hand. Estella watches and allows Pip to kiss her afterwards. Pip visits Miss Havisham regularly until he is old enough to learn a trade.[16]

Joe accompanies Pip during the last visit to Miss Havisham, and she gives Pip money to become an apprentice blacksmith. Joe's surly assistant, Dolge Orlick, is envious of Pip and dislikes Mrs. Joe. Orlick also complains when Joe says he needs to take Pip somewhere midday, thinking this is another sign of favoritism, of which Joe assures him he can quit work for the day. When Pip and Joe are away from the house, Joe's wife is brutally attacked, leaving her unable to speak or do her work. When Pip sees a leg iron, the weapon used in the attack, he becomes worried, believing it was the same leg iron he helped liberate the convict from. Now bedridden, Mrs. Joe cannot be as ""rampaging"" towards Pip as before the attack. Pip's former schoolmate Biddy joins the household to help with her care.[17]

Four years into Pip's apprenticeship, Mr Jaggers, a lawyer, informs him that he has been provided money from an anonymous patron, allowing him to become a gentleman. Presuming Miss Havisham is his benefactress, Pip visits her before leaving for London.[18]

Pip's first experience with urban England is a shock, for London is not the ""soft white city"" Pip imagined, but a place of heavy litter and filth. Pip moves intoBarnard's Innwith Herbert Pocket, the son of his tutor, Matthew Pocket, who is Miss Havisham's cousin. Pip realizes Herbert is the boy he fought with years ago. Herbert tells Pip how Miss Havisham was defrauded and deserted by her fiancé. Pip meets fellow pupils, Bentley Drummle, a brute of a man from a wealthy noble family, and Startop, who is a more agreeable colleague. Jaggers disburses the money Pip needs.[19]During a visit, Pip meets Jaggers's housekeeper, Molly, a former convict.

When Joe visits Pip at Barnard's Inn, Pip is ashamed to be seen with him. Joe relays a message from Miss Havisham that Estella will be visiting her. Pip returns there to meet Estella and is encouraged by Miss Havisham, but avoids visiting Joe. He is disquieted to see Orlick now in service to Miss Havisham. He mentions his misgivings to Jaggers, who promises Orlick's dismissal. In London, Pip and Herbert exchange their romantic secrets: Pip adores Estella, and Herbert is engaged to Clara. Pip meets Estella when she is sent toRichmondto be introduced into society.[20]

Pip and Herbert build up debts. Mrs Joe dies and Pip returns to his village for her funeral. Pip's income is fixed at £500 (equivalent to £53,000 in 2023) per annum when he comes of age at 21. With the help of Jaggers' clerk,John Wemmick, Pip plans to help advance Herbert's prospects by anonymously securing him a position with the shipbroker, Clarriker's. Pip takes Estella to Satis House, where she and Miss Havisham quarrel over Estella's coldness. In London, Drummle outrages Pip by proposing a toast to Estella. Later, at an Assembly Ball in Richmond, Pip witnesses Estella meeting Drummle and warns her about him; she replies that she has no qualms about entrapping him.[21]

A week after his 23rd birthday, Pip learns that his benefactor is the convict he encountered in the churchyard, Abel Magwitch. He had beentransportedtoNew South Walesafter being captured. He has become wealthy after gaining his freedom there, but he cannot return to England on pain of death. However, he returns to see Pip, who was the motivation for all his success.

A shocked Pip stops taking Magwitch's money, but devises a plan with Herbert to help him escape from England.[22]Magwitch shares his past with Pip, and reveals that the escaped convict whom he fought in the churchyard wasCompeyson, the fraudster who had deserted Miss Havisham.[23]

Pip returns to Satis House to visit Estella and meets Drummle, who has also come to see her and now has Orlick as his servant. Pip confronts Miss Havisham for misleading him about his benefactor, but she says she did it to annoy her relatives. Pip declares his love to Estella, who coldly tells him she plans to marry Drummle. A heartbroken Pip returns to London, where Wemmick warns him that Compeyson is looking for him.[24]

At Jaggers's house at dinner, Wemmick tells Pip how Jaggers acquired his maidservant, Molly, rescuing her from the gallows when she was accused of murder.[25]A remorseful Miss Havisham tells Pip how she raised Estella to be unfeeling and heartless ever since Jaggers brought her in as an infant with no information on her parentage. She also tells Pip that Estella is now married. She gives Pip money to pay for Herbert's position at Clarriker's and asks for his forgiveness. As Pip is about to leave, Miss Havisham's dress catches fire, and Pip injures himself in an unsuccessful attempt to save her. Realising that Estella is the daughter of Molly and Magwitch, Pip is discouraged by Jaggers from acting on his suspicions.[26]

A few days before Magwitch's planned escape, Pip is tricked by an anonymous letter into going to a sluice-house near his old home, where he is seized by Orlick, who intends to murder him and freely admits to injuring Pip's sister. As Pip is about to be struck with a hammer, Herbert and Startop arrive and save him. The three pick up Magwitch to row him to the steamboat for Hamburg, but they are met by a police boat carrying Compeyson, who has offered to identify Magwitch. Magwitch seizes Compeyson, and they fight in the river. Seriously injured, Magwitch is taken by the police. Compeyson's body is found later.[27]

Aware that Magwitch's fortune will go to the Crown after his trial, Pip visits a dying Magwitch in the prison hospital and tells him that his daughter Estella is alive. Herbert, who is preparing to move toCairo, Egypt, to manage Clarriker's office, offers Pip a position there. After Herbert's departure, Pip falls ill in his room and faces arrest for debt. However, Joe nurses Pip back to health and pays off the debt. After recovering, Pip then returns to propose to Biddy, only to find that she has married Joe. Pip apologises to Joe, vows to repay him, and leaves for Cairo. There, he moves in with Herbert and Clara, eventually advancing to become third in the company. Only then does Herbert learn that Pip paid for his position in the firm.[28]

After working for eleven years in Egypt, Pip returns to England and visits Joe, Biddy, and their son, Pip Jr. Then, in the ruins of Satis House, he meets the widowed Estella, who asks Pip to forgive her, assuring him that her misfortune and her abusive marriage to Drummle until his death have opened her heart. As Pip takes Estella's hand, and they leave the moonlit ruins, he sees ""no shadow of another parting from her"".[29]

As Dickens began writingGreat Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours. His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife,Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much youngerEllen Ternan. It has been suggested that the icy teasing of the character Estella is based on Ellen Ternan's reluctance to become Dickens's mistress.[31]

In hisBook of Memoranda, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar inGreat Expectations. There is also a reference to a ""knowing man"", a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle.[32]Another evokes a house full of ""Toadies and Humbugs"", foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11.[32][33]Margaret Cardwelldiscovered the ""premonition"" ofGreat Expectationsfrom a 25 September 1855letter from Dickensto W. H. Wills, in which Dickens speaks of recycling an ""odd idea"" from the Christmas special ""A House to Let"" and ""the pivot round which my next book shall revolve"".[34][35]The ""odd idea"" concerns an individual who ""retires to an old lonely house…resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it"".[34]

In an 8 August 1860 letter toThomas Carlyle, Dickens reported his agitation whenever he prepared a new book.[32]A month later, in a letter toJohn Forster, Dickens announced that he just had a new idea.[36]

Dickens was pleased with the idea, calling it ""such a very fine, new and grotesque idea"" in a letter to Forster.[11]He planned to write ""a little piece"", a ""grotesque tragi-comic conception"", about a young hero who befriends an escaped convict, who then makes a fortune in Australia and anonymously bequeaths his property to the hero. In the end, the hero loses the money because it is forfeited to the Crown. In his biography of Dickens, Forster wrote that in the early idea ""was the germ of Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number form"".[37]Dickens presented the relationship between Pip and Magwitch pivotal toGreat Expectationsbut without Miss Havisham, Estella, or other characters he later created.

As the idea and Dickens's ambition grew, he began writing. However, in September, the weeklyAll the Year Roundsaw its sales fall, and its flagship publication,A Day's RidebyCharles Lever, lost favour with the public. Dickens ""called a council of war"", and believed that to save the situation, ""the one thing to be done was for [him] to strike in"".[38]The ""very fine, new and grotesque idea"" became the magazine's new support: weeklies, five hundred pages, just over one year (1860–1861), thirty-six episodes, starting 1 December. The magazine continued to publish Lever's novel until its completion on 23 March 1861,[39]but it became secondary toGreat Expectations. Immediately, sales resumed, and critics responded positively, as exemplified byThe Times's praise: ""Great Expectationsis not, indeed, [Dickens's] best work, but it is to be ranked among his happiest"".[40]

Dickens, whose health was not the best, felt ""The planning from week to week was unimaginably difficult"" but persevered.[39]He thought he had found ""a good name"", decided to use the first person ""throughout"", and thought the beginning was ""excessively droll"": ""I have put a child and a good-natured foolish man, in relations that seem to me very funny"".[41]Four weekly episodes were ""ground off the wheel"" in October 1860,[42]and apart from one reference to the ""bondage"" of his heavy task,[43]the months passed without the anguished cries that usually accompanied the writing of his novels.[39]He did not even use theNumber PlansorMems;[N 2]he had only a few notes on the characters' ages, the tide ranges for chapter 54, and the draft of an ending. In late December, Dickens wrote toMary Boylethat ""Great Expectations[is] a very great success and universally liked"".[10]

Dickens gave six readings from 14 March to 18 April 1861, and in May, Dickens took a few days' holiday inDover. On the eve of his departure, he took some friends and family members for a trip by boat fromBlackwalltoSouthend-on-Sea. Ostensibly for pleasure, the mini-cruise was actually a working session for Dickens to examine banks of the river in preparation for the chapter devoted to Magwitch's attempt to escape.[37]Dickens then revised Herbert Pocket's appearance, no doubt, asserts Margaret Cardwell, to look more like his sonCharley.[44]On 11 June 1861, Dickens wrote to Macready thatGreat Expectationshad been completed and on 15 June, asked the editor to prepare the novel for publication.[39]

Following comments byEdward Bulwer-Lyttonthat the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication. The ending set aside by Dickens has Pip, who is still single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle's widow, she has remarried.[39][45]It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: ""[the] winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go"".[39][46]Dickens revised the ending for publication so that Pip meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House, she is a widow and he is single. His changes at the conclusion of the novel did not quite end either with the final weekly part or the first bound edition, because Dickens further changed the last sentence in the amended 1868 version from ""I could see the shadow of no parting from her""[39]to ""I saw no shadow of another parting from her"".[47]As Pip useslitotes, ""no shadow of another parting"", it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or Pip remains single.Angus Calder, writing for an edition in thePenguin English Library, believed the less definite phrasing of the amended 1868 version perhaps hinted at a buried meaning: 'at this happy moment, I did not see the shadow of our subsequent parting looming over us.'[48]

In a letter to Forster, Dickens explained his decision to alter the draft ending: ""You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the end ofGreat Expectationsfrom and after Pip's return to Joe's ... Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken with the book, strongly urged it upon me, after reading the proofs, and supported his views with such good reasons that I have resolved to make the change. I have put in as pretty a little piece of writing as I could, and I have no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the alteration"".[49][50]

This discussion between Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton and Forster has provided the basis for much discussion on Dickens's underlying views for this famous novel. Earle Davis, in his 1963 study of Dickens, wrote that ""it would be an inadequate moral point to deny Pip any reward after he had shown a growth of character,"" and that ""Eleven years might change Estella too"".[51]John Forster felt that the original ending was ""more consistent"" and ""more natural""[52][53]but noted the new ending's popularity.[54]George Gissingcalled that revision ""a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens"" and felt thatGreat Expectationswould have been perfect had Dickens not altered the ending in deference to Bulwer-Lytton.[N 3][55]

In contrast, John Hillis-Miller stated that Dickens's personality was so assertive that Bulwer-Lytton had little influence, and welcomed the revision: ""The mists of infatuation have cleared away, [Estella and Pip] can be joined"".[56]Earl Davis notes that G. B. Shaw published the novel in 1937 forThe Limited Editions Clubwith the first ending and thatThe Rinehart Editionof 1979 presents both endings.[54][57][58]

George Orwellwrote, ""Psychologically the latter part ofGreat Expectationsis about the best thing Dickens ever did,"" but, like John Forster and several early 20th century writers, includingGeorge Bernard Shaw, felt that the original ending was more consistent with the draft, as well as the natural working out of the tale.[59]Modern literary criticism is split over the matter.

Dickens andWillsco-ownedAll the Year Round, one 75%, the other 25%. Since Dickens was his own publisher, he did not require a contract for his own works.[60]Although intended for weekly publication,Great Expectationswas divided into nine monthly sections, with new pagination for each.[53]Harper's Weeklypublished the novel from 24 November 1860 to 5 August 1861 in the US andAll the Year Roundpublished it from 1 December 1860 to 3 August 1861 in the UK.Harper'spaid £1,000 (equivalent to £119,000 in 2023) for publication rights. Dickens welcomed a contract withTauchnitz4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.

Publications inHarper's Weeklywere accompanied by forty illustrations by John McLenan;[61]however, this is the only Dickens work published inAll the Year Roundwithout illustrations.

Robert L Patten identifies four American editions in 1861 and sees the proliferation of publications in Europe and across the Atlantic as ""extraordinary testimony"" toGreat Expectations's popularity.[62]Chapman and Hall published the first edition in three volumes in 1861,[2][3][4]five subsequent reprints between 6 July and 30 October, and a one-volume edition in 1862. The ""bargain"" edition was published in 1862, the Library Edition in 1864, and the Charles Dickens edition in 1868. To this list, Paul Schlicke adds ""two meticulous scholarly editions"", one Clarendon Press published in 1993 with an introduction by Margaret Cardwell[63]and another with an introduction by Edgar Rosenberg, published by Norton in 1999.[53]The novel was published with one ending (visible in the four online editions listed in the External links at the end of this article). In some 20th century editions, the novel ends as originally published in 1867, and in an afterword, the ending Dickens did not publish, along with a brief story of how a friend persuaded him to a happier ending for Pip, is presented to the reader (for example, 1987 audio edition by Recorded Books[64]).

In 1862, Marcus Stone,[65]son of Dickens's old friend, the painter Frank Stone, was invited to create eight woodcuts for the Library Edition. According to Paul Schlicke, these illustrations are mediocre yet were included in the Charles Dickens edition, and Stone created illustrations for Dickens's subsequent novel,Our Mutual Friend.[53]Later, Henry Mathew Brock also illustratedGreat Expectationsand a 1935 edition ofA Christmas Carol,[66]along with other artists, such as John McLenan,[67]F. A. Fraser,[68]and Harry Furniss.[69]

Robert L. Patten estimates thatAll the Year Roundsold 100,000 copies ofGreat Expectationseach week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy.[70]Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers. Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that ""You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in theTale of Two Cities,""[71]an opinion Forster supports, finding that ""Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book"".[37][72]Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles.[6]

Overall,Great Expectationswas widely praised,[6]although not all reviews were favourable, however;Margaret Oliphant's review, published May 1862 inBlackwood's Magazine, vilified the novel. Critics in the 19th and 20th centuries hailed it as one of Dickens's greatest successes although often for conflicting reasons: G. K. Chesterton admired the novel's optimism; Edmund Wilson its pessimism; Humphry House in 1941 emphasized its social context. In 1974, Jerome H. Buckley saw it as aBildungsroman, writing a chapter on Dickens and two of his major protagonists (David CopperfieldandPip) in his 1974 book on the Bildungsroman in Victorian writing.[73]John Hillis Miller wrote in 1958 that Pip is the archetype of all Dickensian heroes.[7]In 1970,Q. D. Leavissuggested ""How We Must ReadGreat Expectations"".[74]In 1984, Peter Brooks, in the wake ofJacques Derrida, offered a deconstructionist reading.[75]The most profound analyst, according to Paul Schlicke, is probablyJulian Moynahan, who, in a 1964 essay surveying the hero's guilt, made Orlick ""Pip's double, alter ego and dark mirror image"". Schlicke also names Anny Sadrin's extensive 1988 study as the ""most distinguished"".[76]

In 2015, theBBCpolled book critics outside the UK about novels by British authors; they rankedGreat Expectationsfourth on the list of the 100 Greatest British Novels.[12]Earlier, in its 2003 pollThe Big Readconcerning the reading taste of the British public,Great Expectationswas voted 17th out of the top 100 novels chosen by survey participants.[13]

Great Expectations's single most obvious literary predecessor is Dickens's earlier first-person protagonist-narratedDavid Copperfield. The two novels trace the psychological and moral development of a young boy to maturity, his transition from a rural environment to the London metropolis, the vicissitudes of his emotional development, and the exhibition of his hopes and youthful dreams and their metamorphosis, through a rich and complex first person narrative.[77]Dickens was conscious of this similarity and, before undertaking his new manuscript, rereadDavid Copperfieldto avoid repetition.[41]

The two books both detail homecoming. AlthoughDavid Copperfieldis based on some of Dickens's personal experiences,Great Expectationsprovides, according to Paul Schlicke, ""the more spiritual and intimate autobiography"".[78]Details of where the novel is set are not given, but according toJohn Forster, Dickens based Satis House onRestoration House, which was near to where he lived inRochester, Kent.[79]""Satis House"" was the house where Rochester MP, SirRichard Watts, entertainedQueen Elizabeth I.[80]Furthermore, no a specific time period is given, but it is indicated in general terms by reference older coaches, the title ""His Majesty"" in reference toGeorge III(1738 – 1820), and to the oldLondon Bridgethat existed prior to the 1824–1831 reconstruction.[81]

The theme of homecoming reflects events in Dickens's life, several years prior to the publication ofGreat Expectations. In 1856, he boughtGad's Hill PlaceinHigham, Kent, which he had dreamed of living in as a child, and moved there from faraway London two years later. In 1858, in a painful marriage breakdown, he separated from Catherine Dickens, his wife of twenty-three years. The separation alienated him from some of his closest friends, such asMark Lemon. He quarrelled withBradbury and Evans, who had published his novels for fifteen years. In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens burned almost all of his correspondence, sparing only letters on business matters.[82][83]He stopped publishing the weeklyHousehold Wordsat the summit of its popularity and replaced it withAll the Year Round.[78]

The Uncommercial Traveller, short stories, and other texts Dickens began publishing in his new weekly in 1859 reflect his nostalgia, as seen in ""Dullborough Town"" and ""Nurses' Stories"". According to Paul Schlicke, ""it is hardly surprising that the novel Dickens wrote at this time was a return to roots, set in the part of England in which he grew up, and in which he had recently resettled"".[78]

Margaret Cardwell draws attention to Chops the Dwarf from Dickens's 1858 Christmas story ""Going into Society"", who, as the future Pip does, entertains the illusion of inheriting a fortune and becomes disappointed upon achieving his social ambitions.[84]In another vein, Harry Stone thinks that Gothic and magical aspects ofGreat Expectationswere partly inspired byCharles Mathews'sAt Home, which was presented in detail inHousehold Wordsand its monthly supplementHousehold Narrative. Stone also asserts thatThe Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices, written in collaboration with Wilkie Collins after their walking tour ofCumberlandduring September 1857 and published inHousehold Wordsfrom 3 to 31 October of the same year, presents certain strange locations and a passionate love, foreshadowingGreat Expectations.[85]

Beyond its biographical and literary aspects,Great Expectationsappears, according to Robin Gilmour, as ""a representative fable of the age"".[86]Dickens was aware that the novel ""speaks"" to a generation applying, at most, the principle of ""self help"" which was believed to have increased the order of daily life. That the hero Pip aspires to improve, not through snobbery, but through theVictorianconviction of education, social refinement, and materialism, was seen as a noble and worthy goal. However, by tracing the origins of Pip's ""great expectations"" to crime, deceit and even banishment to the colonies, Dickens unfavourably compares the new generation to the previous one of Joe Gargery, which Dickens portrays as less sophisticated but especially rooted in sound values, presenting an oblique criticism of his time.[86]

The narrative structure ofGreat Expectationsis influenced by the fact that it was first published as weekly episodes in a periodical. This required short chapters, centred on a single subject, and an almost mathematical structure.[87]

Pip's story is told in three stages: his childhood and early youth in Kent, where he dreams of rising above his humble station; his time in London after receiving ""great expectations""; and then finally his disillusionment on discovering the source of his fortune, followed by his slow realisation of the vanity of his false values.[88]These three stages are further divided into twelve parts of equal length. This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, which has often been commented on. George Gissing, for example, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan'l Peggotty (fromDavid Copperfield), preferred the former, because he is a stronger character, who lives ""in a world, not ofmelodrama, but of everyday cause and effect"".[89]G. B. Shaw also commented on the novel's structure, describing it as ""compactly perfect"", andAlgernon Swinburnestated, ""The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea"".[90][91]A contributing factor is ""the briskness of the narrative tone"".[92]

Further, beyond the chronological sequences and the weaving of several storylines into a tight plot, the sentimental setting and morality of the characters also create a pattern.[93]The narrative structure ofGreat Expectationshas two main elements: firstly that of ""foster parents"", Miss Havisham, Magwitch, and Joe, and secondly that of ""young people"", Estella, Pip and Biddy. There is a further organizing element that can be labelled ""Dangerous Lovers"", which includes Compeyson, Bentley Drummle and Orlick. Pip is the centre of this web of love, rejection and hatred. Dickens contrasts this ""dangerous love"" with the relationship of Biddy and Joe, which grows from friendship to marriage.

This is ""the general frame of the novel"". The term ""love"" is generic, applying it to both Pip's true love for Estella and the feelings Estella has for Drummle, which are based on a desire for social advancement. Similarly, Estella rejects Magwitch because of her contempt for everything that appears below what she believes to be her social status.[94]

Great Expectationshas an unhappy ending, since most characters suffer physically, psychologically or both, or die—often violently—while suffering. Happy resolutions remain elusive, while hate thrives. The only happy ending is Biddy and Joe's marriage and the birth of their two children, since the final reconciliations, except that between Pip and Magwitch, do not alter the general order. Though Pip extirpates the web of hatred, the first unpublished ending denies him happiness while Dickens's revised second ending, in the published novel, leaves his future uncertain.[95]

Julian Moynahan argues that the reader can better understand Pip's personality through analysing his relationship with Orlick, the criminal laborer who works at Joe Gargery's forge, than by looking at his relationship with Magwitch.[96]

Following Moynahan,David Trotter[97]notes that Orlick is Pip's shadow. Co-workers in the forge, both find themselves at Miss Havisham's, where Pip enters and joins the company, while Orlick, attending the door, stays out. Pip considers Biddy a sister; Orlick has other plans for her; Pip is connected to Magwitch, Orlick to Magwitch's nemesis, Compeyson. Orlick also aspires to ""great expectations"" and resents Pip's ascension from the forge and the swamp to the glamour of Satis House, from which Orlick is excluded, along with London's dazzling society. Orlick is the cumbersome shadow Pip cannot remove.[97]

Then comes Pip's punishment, with Orlick's savage attack on Mrs Gargery. Thereafter Orlick vanishes, only to reappear in chapter 53 in a symbolic act, when he lures Pip into a locked, abandoned building in the marshes. Orlick has a score to settle before going on to the ultimate act, murder. However, Pip hampers Orlick, because of his privileged status, while Orlick remains a slave of his condition, solely responsible for Mrs Gargery's fate.[97][98]

Dickens also uses Pip's upper class counterpart, Bentley Drummle, ""the double of a double"", according to Trotter, in a similar way.[98]Like Orlick, Drummle is powerful, swarthy, unintelligible, hot-blooded, and lounges and lurks, biding his time. Estella rejects Pip for this rude, uncouth but well-born man, and ends Pip's hope. Finally the lives of both Orlick and Drummle end violently.[98]

Although the novel is written in first person, the reader knows—as an essential prerequisite—thatGreat Expectationsis not an autobiography but a novel, a work of fiction with plot and characters, featuring a narrator-protagonist. In addition, Sylvère Monod notes that the treatment of the autobiography differs fromDavid Copperfield, asGreat Expectationsdoes not draw from events in Dickens's life; ""at most some traces of a broad psychological and moral introspection can be found"".[99]

However, according to Paul Pickerel's analysis, Pip—as both narrator and protagonist—recounts with hindsight the story of the young boy he was, who did not know the world beyond a narrow geographic and familial environment. The novel's direction emerges from the confrontation between the two periods of time. At first, the novel presents a mistreated orphan, repeating situations fromOliver TwistandDavid Copperfield, but the trope is quickly overtaken. The theme manifests itself when Pip discovers the existence of a world beyond the marsh, the forge and the future Joe envisioned for him, the decisive moment when Miss Havisham and Estella enter his life.[100]This is a red herring, as the decay of Satis House and the strange lady within signals the fragility of an impasse. At this point, the reader knows more than the protagonist, creatingdramatic ironythat confers a superiority that the narrator shares.[101]

It is not until Magwitch's return, a plot twist that unites loosely connected plot elements and sets them into motion, that the protagonist's point of view joins those of the narrator and the reader.[102]In this context of progressive revelation, the sensational events at the novel's end serve to test the protagonist's point of view. Thus proceeds, in the words of A. E. Dyson, ""The Immolations of Pip"".[103]

Some of the narrative devices that Dickens uses arecaricature, comic speech mannerisms, intrigue,Gothicatmosphere, and a central character who gradually changes. Earl Davis notes the close network of the structure and balance of contrasts, and praises the first-person narration for providing a simplicity that is appropriate for the story while avoidingmelodrama. Davis sees the symbolism attached to ""great expectations""[vague]as reinforcing the novel's impact.[104]

Characters then become themes in themselves, almost aWagnerianleitmotiv, whose attitudes are repeated at each of their appearances as a musical phrase signaling their entry.[105]For example, Jaggers constantly chews the same fingernail and washes his hands with scented soap, Orlick lurches his huge body, and Matthew Pocket always pulls at his hair. Seen by the narrator, their attitude is mechanical, like that of an automaton: in the general scheme, the gesture betrays the uneasiness of the unaccomplished or exasperated man, his betrayed hope, his unsatisfied life.[105]In this set, every character is orbited by ""satellite"" characters. Wemmick is Jaggers's copy at work, but has placed in Walworth a secret garden, a castle with a family of an elderly father and a middle-aged fiancée, where he happily devours buttered bread.[106]Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally playsHamletin London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip's fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection.[107]

For Pip's redemption to be credible, Trotter writes, the words of the main character must sound right.[108]Christopher Ricks adds that Pip's frankness induces empathy, dramatics are avoided,[109]and his good actions are more eloquent than words. Dickens's subtle narrative technique is also shown when he has Pip confess that he arranged Herbert's partnership with Clarriker, has Miss Havisham finally see the true character of her cousin Matthew Pocket, and has Pocket refuse the money she offers him.[110]To this end, the narrative method subtly changes until, during the perilous journey down the Thames to remove Magwitch in chapter 54, the narrative point-of-view shifts from first person to the omniscient point of view. For the first time, Ricks writes, the ""I"" ceases to be Pip's thoughts and switches to the other characters, the focus, at once, turns outward, and this is mirrored in the imagery of the black waters tormented waves and eddies, which heaves with an anguish that encompasses the entire universe, the passengers, the docks, the river, the night.[110]

According to Paul Davis, while more realistic than itsautobiographical predecessorwritten when novels likeGeorge Eliot'sAdam Bedewere in vogue,Great Expectationsis in many ways a poetic work built around recurring symbolic images: the desolation of the marshes; the twilight; the chains of the house, the past, the painful memory; the fire; the hands that manipulate and control; the distant stars of desire; the river connecting past, present and future.[111]

Great Expectationscontains a variety of literary genres, including the bildungsroman, gothic novel, crime novel, as well as comedy,melodramaand satire; and it belongs—likeWuthering Heightsand the novels ofWalter Scott—to the romance rather thanrealisttradition of the novel.[112]

Complex and multifaceted,Great Expectationsis a Victorianbildungsroman, or initiatory tale, which focuses on a protagonist who matures over the course of the novel.Great Expectationsdescribes Pip's initial frustration upon leaving home, followed by a long and difficult period that is punctuated with conflicts between his desires and the values of established order. During this time he re-evaluates his life and re-enters society on new foundations.[81]

However, the novel differs from the two preceding pseudo-autobiographies,David CopperfieldandBleak House(1852), (though the latter is only partially narrated in first-person), in that it also partakes of several sub-genres popular in Dickens's time.[113][81]

Great Expectationscontains many comic scenes and eccentric personalities, integral parts to both the plot and the theme. Among the notable comic episodes are Pip's Christmas dinner in chapter 4, Wopsle'sHamletperformance in chapter 31, and Wemmick's marriage in chapter 55. Many of the characters have eccentricities: Jaggers with his punctilious lawyerly ways; the contrariness of his clerk, Wemmick, at work advising Pip to invest in ""portable property"", while in private living in a cottage converted into a castle; and the reclusive Miss Havisham in her decaying mansion, wearing her tattered bridal robes.[114]

Great Expectationsincorporates elements of the new genre ofcrime fiction, which Dickens had already used inOliver Twist(1837), and which was being developed by his friendsWilkie CollinsandWilliam Harrison Ainsworth. With its scenes of convicts,prison ships, and episodes of bloody violence, Dickens creates characters worthy of theNewgate school of fiction.[115]

Great Expectationscontains elements of theGothic genre, especially Miss Havisham, the bride frozen in time, and the ruined Satis House filled with weeds and spiders.[81]Other characters linked to this genre include the aristocratic Bentley Drummle, because of his extreme cruelty; Pip himself, who spends his youth chasing a frozen beauty; the monstrous Orlick, who systematically attempts to murder his employers. Then there is the fight to the death between Compeyson and Magwitch, and the fire that ends up killing Miss Havisham, scenes dominated by horror, suspense, and the sensational.[113]

Elements of thesilver-fork novelare found in the character of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip's illusions. This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s,[116]presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society. In some respects, Dickens conceivedGreat Expectationsas an anti silver fork novel, attackingCharles Lever's novelA Day's Ride, publication of which began January 1860, inHousehold Words.[81][117]This can be seen in the way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook.[81]

ThoughGreat Expectationsis not obviously a historical novel, Dickens does emphasise differences between the time that the novel is set (c.1812–46) and when it was written (1860–1).

Great Expectationsbegins around 1812 (the year of Dickens's birth), continues until around 1830–1835, and then jumps to around 1840–1845, during which theGreat Western Railwaywas built.[81]Though readers today will not notice this, Dickens uses various things to emphasise the differences between 1861 and this earlier period. Among these details—that contemporary readers would have recognised—are the one pound note (in chapter 10) that theBank Notes Act 1826had removed from circulation;[118]likewise, the death penalty for deported felons who returned to Britain was abolished in 1835. Thegallowserected in the swamps, designed to display a rotting corpse, had disappeared by 1832, andGeorge III, the monarch mentioned at the beginning, died in 1820, when Pip would have been seven or eight.

Miss Havisham paid Joe 25 guineas, gold coins, when Pip was to begin his apprenticeship (in chapter 13); guinea coins were slowly going out of circulation after thelast new oneswere struck with the face of George III in 1799. This also marks the historical period, as the one pound note was the official currency at the time of the novel's publication. Dickens placed the epilogue 11 years after Magwitch's death, which seems to be the time limit of the reported facts. Collectively, the details suggest that Dickens identified with the main character. If Pip is around 23 toward the middle of the novel and 34 at its end, he is roughly modeled after his creator who turned 34 in 1846.[81]

The title's ""Expectations"" refers to ""a legacy to come"",[119]and thus immediately announces that money, or more specifically wealth plays an important part in the novel.[7]Some other major themes are crime, social class, including both gentility, and social alienation, imperialism and ambition. The novel is also concerned with questions relating to conscience and moral regeneration, as well as redemption through love.

Dickens famously created comic and telling names for his characters,[120]but inGreat Expectationshe goes further. The first sentence of the novel establishes that Pip's proper name is Philip Pirrip—the wording of his father's gravestone—which ""my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip"". The name Philip Pirrip (or Pirrip) is never again used in the novel. In Chapter 18, when he receives his expectation from an anonymous benefactor, the first condition attached to it is ""that you always bear the name of Pip"".

In Chapter 22, when Pip establishes his friendship with Herbert Pocket, he attempts to introduce himself as Philip. Herbert immediately rejects the name:""'I don't take to Philip,' said he, smiling, 'for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book'"" and decides to refer to Pip exclusively as Handel:""'Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called theHarmonious Blacksmith'"". The only other place he is referred to as Philip is in Chapter 44, when he receives a letter addressed to ""Philip Pip"" from his friend Wemmick, which says ""DON'T GO HOME"".

A central theme here is of people living as social outcasts. The novel's opening setting emphasises this: the orphaned Pip lives in an isolated foggy environment next to a graveyard, dangerous swamps, andprison ships. Furthermore, ""I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion and morality"".[121]

Pip feels excluded by society and this leads to his aggressive attitude towards it, as he tries to win his place within it through any means. Various other characters behave similarly—that is, the oppressed become the oppressors. Jaggers dominates Wemmick, who in turn dominates Jaggers's clients. Likewise, Magwitch uses Pip as an instrument of vengeance, as Miss Havisham uses Estella.[122]

However, Pip has hope despite his sense of exclusion[123]because he is convinced thatdivine providenceowes him a place in society and that marriage to Estella is his destiny. Therefore, when fortune comes his way, Pip shows no surprise, because he believes that his value as a human being and his inherent nobility have been recognized. Thus, Pip accepts Pumblechook's flattery without blinking: ""That boy is no common boy""[124]and the ""May I?MayI?"" associated with handshakes.[125]

From Pip's hope comes his ""uncontrollable, impossible love for Estella"",[126]despite the humiliations to which she has subjected him. For Pip, winning a place in society also means winning Estella's heart.

When the money secretly provided by Magwitch enables Pip to enter London society, two new related themes, wealth and gentility, are introduced.

As the novel's title implies, money is a theme ofGreat Expectations. Central to this is the idea that wealth is only acceptable to the ruling class if it comes from the labour of others.[127]Miss Havisham's wealth comes not from the sweat of her brow but from rent collected on properties she inherited from her father, a brewer. Her wealth is ""pure"", and her father's profession as a brewer does not contaminate it. Herbert states in chapter 22 that ""while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew"".[128]Because of her wealth, the old lady, despite her eccentricity, enjoys public esteem. She remains in a constant business relationship with her lawyer Jaggers and keeps a tight grip over her ""court"" of sycophants, so that, far from representingsocial exclusion, she is the very image of a powerful landed aristocracy that is frozen in the past and ""embalmed in its own pride"".[129]

On the other hand, Magwitch's wealth is socially unacceptable, firstly because he earned it, not through the efforts of others, but through his own hard work, and secondly because he was a convict, and he earned it in a penal colony. It is argued that the contrast with Miss Havisham's wealth is suggested symbolically. Thus Magwitch's money smells of sweat, and his money is greasy and crumpled: ""two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle market in the country"",[130]while the coins Miss Havisham gives for Pip's ""indentures"" shine as if new. Further, it is argued Pip demonstrates his ""good breeding"", because when he discovers that he owes his transformation into a ""gentleman"" to such a contaminated windfall, he is repulsed.[129]A. O. J. Cockshut, however, has suggested that there is no difference between Magwitch's wealth and that of Miss Havisham.[131]

Trotter emphasizes the importance of Magwitch's greasy banknotes. Beyond Pip's emotional reaction the notes reveal that Dickens's views on social and economic progress have changed in the years prior to the publication ofGreat Expectations.[132]His novels andHousehold Wordsextensively reflect Dickens's views, and his efforts to contribute to social progress expanded in the 1840s. To illustrate his point, he cites Humphry House who, succinctly, writes that inPickwick Papers, ""a bad smell was a bad smell"", whereas inOur Mutual FriendandGreat Expectations, ""it is a problem"".[132][133]

At the time ofThe Great Exhibitionof 1851, Dickens andRichard Henry Horne, an editor ofHousehold Words, wrote an article comparing the British technology that createdthe Crystal Palaceto the few artifacts exhibited by China: England represented an openness to worldwide trade and China isolationism. ""To compare China and England is to compare Stoppage to Progress"", they concluded. According to Trotter, this was a way to target theTorygovernment's return toprotectionism, which they felt would make England the China of Europe. In fact,Household Words'17 May 1856 issue championed internationalfree trade, comparing the constant flow of money to the circulation of the blood.[134]In the 1850s, Dickens believed in ""genuine"" wealth, which critic Trotter compares to fresh banknotes, crisp to the touch, pure and odorless.[134]

WithGreat Expectations, Dickens's views about wealth have changed. However, though some sharpsatireexists, no character in the novel has the role of the moralist that condemn Pip and his society. In fact, even Joe and Biddy themselves, paragons of good sense, are complicit, through their exaggerated innate humility, in Pip's social deviancy. Dickens's moral judgement is first made through the way that he contrasts characters: only a few characters keep to the straight and narrow path; Joe, whose values remain unchanged; Matthew Pocket whose pride renders him, to his family's astonishment, unable to flatter his rich relatives; Jaggers, who keeps a cool head and has no illusions about his clients; Biddy, who overcomes her shyness to, from time to time, bring order. The narrator-hero is left to draw the necessary conclusions: in the end, Pip finds the light and embarks on a path of moral regeneration.[135]

In London, neither wealth nor gentility brings happiness. Pip, the apprentice gentleman constantly bemoans his anxiety, his feelings of insecurity,[136]and multiple allusions to overwhelming chronic unease, to weariness, drown his enthusiasm (chapter 34).[137]Wealth, in effect, eludes his control: the more he spends, the deeper he goes into debt to satisfy new needs, which were just as futile as his old ones.

His unusual path to gentility has the opposite effect to what he expected: infinite opportunities become available, certainly, but will power, in proportion, fades and paralyses the soul. In the crowded metropolis, Pip grows disenchanted, disillusioned, and lonely. Alienated from his native Kent, he has lost the support provided by the village blacksmith. In London, he is powerless to join a community, not the Pocket family, much less Jaggers's circle. London has become Pip's prison and, like the convicts of his youth, he is bound in chains: ""no Satis House can be built merely with money"".[138][N 4]

The idea of ""good breeding"" and what makes for a ""gentleman"" other than money, in other words, ""gentility"", is a central theme ofGreat Expectations. The convict Magwitch covets it by proxy through Pip; Mrs Pocket dreams of acquiring it; it is also found in Pumblechook's sycophancy; it is even seen in Joe, when he stammers between ""Pip"" and ""Sir"" during his visit to London, and when Biddy's letters to Pip suddenly become reverent.

There are other characters who are associated with the idea of gentility like, for example, Miss Havisham's seducer, Compeyson, the scarred-face convict. While Compeyson is corrupt, even Magwitch does not forget he is a gentleman.[139]This also includes Estella, who ignores the fact that she is the daughter of Magwitch and another criminal.[129]

There are a couple of ways by which someone can acquire gentility, one being a title, another being family ties to the upper middle class. Mrs Pocket bases every aspiration on the fact that her grandfather failed to be knighted, while Pip hopes that Miss Havisham will eventually adopt him, as adoption, as evidenced by Estella, who behaves like a born and bred little lady, is acceptable.[140]But even more important, though not sufficient, are wealth and education. Pip knows that and endorses it, as he hears from Jaggers through Matthew Pocket: ""I was not designed for any profession, and I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances.""[141]But neither the educated Matthew Pocket, nor Jaggers, who has earned his status solely through his intellect, can aspire to gentility. Bentley Drummle, however, embodies the social ideal, so that Estella marries him without hesitation.[140]

Another theme ofGreat Expectationsis that Pip can undergo ""moral regeneration"".

In chapter 39, the novel's turning point, Magwitch visits Pip to see the gentleman he has made, and once the convict has hidden in Herbert Pocket's room, Pip realises his situation:

To cope with his situation and his learning that he now needs Magwitch, a hunted, injured man who traded his life for Pip's. Pip can only rely on the power of love for Estella.[143]Pip now goes through a number of different stages each of which, is accompanied by successive realisations about the vanity of the prior certainties.[144]

Pip's problem is more psychological and moral than social. Pip's climbing of the social ladder upon gaining wealth is followed by a corresponding degradation of his integrity. Thus after his first visit in Miss Havisham, the innocent young boy from the marshes, suddenly turns into a liar to dazzle his sister, Mrs Joe, and his Uncle Pumblechook with the tales of a carriage and veal chops.[136]More disturbing is his fascination with Satis House—where he is despised and even slapped, beset by ghostly visions, rejected by the Pockets—and the gradual growth of the mirage of London. The allure of wealth overpowers loyalty and gratitude, even conscience itself. This is evidenced by the urge to buy Joe's return, in chapter 27, Pip's haughty glance as Joe deciphers the alphabet, not to mention the condescending contempt he confesses to Biddy, copying Estella's behaviour toward him.[145]

Pip represents, as do those he mimics, the bankruptcy of the ""idea of the gentleman"", and becomes the sole beneficiary of vulgarity, inversely proportional to his mounting gentility.[146]In chapter 30, Dickens parodies the new disease that is corroding Pip's moral values through the character ""Trabb's boy"", who is the only one not to be fooled. The boy parades through the main street of the village with boyish antics and contortions meant to satirically imitate Pip. The gross, comic caricature openly exposes the hypocrisy of thisnewgentleman in a frock coat and top hat. Trabb's boy reveals that appearance has taken precedence over being, protocol on feelings, decorum on authenticity; labels reign to the point of absurdity, and human solidarity is no longer the order of the day.[147]

Estella and Miss Havisham represent rich people who enjoy a materially easier life but cannot cope with a tougher reality. Miss Havisham, like a melodramatic heroine, withdrew from life at the first sign of hardship. Estella, excessively spoiled and pampered, sorely lacks judgement and falls prey to the first gentleman who approaches her, though he is the worst. Estella's marriage to such a brute demonstrates the failure of her education. Estella is used to dominating but becomes a victim to her own vice, brought to her level by a man born, in her image.[148]

Dickens uses imagery to reinforce his ideas and London, the paradise of the rich and of theidealof the gentleman, has mounds of filth, it is crooked, decrepit, and greasy, a dark desert of bricks, soot, rain, and fog. The surviving vegetation is stunted, and confined to fenced-off paths, without air or light. Barnard's Inn, where Pip lodges, offers mediocre food and service while the rooms, despite the furnishing provided, as Suhamy states, ""for the money"", is most uncomfortable, a far cry from Joe's large kitchen, radiating hearth, and his well-stocked pantry.[138]

Likewise, such a world, dominated by the lure of money and social prejudice, also leads to the warping of people and morals, to family discord and war between man and woman.[N 5]In contrast to London's corruption stands Joe, despite his intellectual and social limitations, in whom the values of the heart prevail and who has natural wisdom.[147]

Another important theme is Pip's sense of guilt, which he has felt from an early age. After the encounter with the convict Magwitch, Pip is afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him. The theme of guilt comes into even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is a convict. Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughoutGreat Expectations, hence the long and painful process of redemption that he undergoes.

Pip's moral regeneration is a true pilgrimage punctuated by suffering. Like Christian inBunyan'sThe Pilgrim's Progress, Pip makes his way up to light through a maze of horrors that afflict his body as well as his mind. This includes the burns he suffers from saving Miss Havisham from the fire; the illness that requires months of recovery; the threat of a violent death at Orlick's hands; debt, and worse, the obligation of having to repay them; hard work, which he recognises as the only worthy source of income, hence his return to Joe's forge. Even more important, is his accepting of Magwitch, a coarse outcast of society.[149]

Dickens makes use of symbolism, in chapter 53, to emphasise Pip's moral regeneration. As he prepares to go down the Thames to rescue the convict, a veil lifted from the river and Pip's spirit. Symbolically the fog which enveloped the marshes as Pip left for London has finally lifted, and he feels ready to become a man.[150]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952,The Yellow Wallpaper,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Wallpaper,"The story describes a young woman and her husband. He imposes arest cureon her when she suffers ""temporary nervous depression"" after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery.  The story makes striking use of anunreliable narratorin order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has ""imprisoned"" her due to her physical and mental condition. She describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor ""scratched and gouged and splintered"", a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all these on children who must have resided there.

The narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room – its ""sickly"" color, its ""yellow"" smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like ""an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,"" its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design. Eventually, she comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must free the woman in the wallpaper, she begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.

When her husband arrives home, the narrator refuses to unlock her door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming, ""I've got out at last... in spite of you.""  He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.

Charlotte Perkins Gilmanused her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expounded upon many issues, such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of apatriarchal society. Through her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such asAlice WalkerandSylvia Plath.[5]

In ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" she portrays the narrator's insanity as a way to protest the professional and societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally fragile.Women’s rightsadvocates of the era believed that the ""outbreak"" of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing because it would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of expression for women at a time when they had very few rights.[5]

After the birth of her first daughter, Gilman suffered postnatal depression and was treated byDr. Silas Weir Mitchell, the leading expert on women's mental health at the time. He suggested a strict 'rest cure' regimen involving much of bed rest and a blanket ban on working, including reading, writing, and painting. After three months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to a complete mental breakdown, the author wrote ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her criticism of the medical field. Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain for the ""rest cure"" when she sought a second opinion fromMary Putnam Jacobi, one of the first female doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that proved a much more successful treatment.[6])

She added that ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" was ""not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked"". Gilman claimed that many years later, she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods. However, literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 – 16 years after ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" was published – was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the ""rest cure"" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.[7][citation needed]

This story has been interpreted byfeminist criticsas a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century medical profession.[8]Throughout the short story, the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better, such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world.  Her ideas are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her condition. This interpretation draws on the concept of the ""domestic sphere"" that women were held in during this period.[9]

Many feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman's assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt trapped.[10]The emphasis on reading and writing asgendered practicesalso illustrated the importance of the wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to ""read"" the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over her husband at the expense of her sanity.

Susan S. Lanser, a professor atBrandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature. ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works' content to be disturbing or offensive. Critics such as the editor of theAtlantic Monthlyrejected the short story because ""[he] could not forgive [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself]"". Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work ofEdgar Allan Poe.[11]""The Yellow Wallpaper"" provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a ""particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision... because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall"".[11]The narrator in the story is trying to find a single meaning in the wallpaper.  At first, she focuses on the contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is ""flamboyant"" while also ""dull"", ""pronounced,"" yet ""lame,"" and ""uncertain"" (p. 13).  She takes into account the patterns and tries to organize them geometrically, but she is further confused.  The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor that the protagonist cannot recognize (p. 25). At night the narrator can see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find ""a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection"".[11]Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a single meaning. ""How we were taught to read,"" as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text.[11]The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as ""The Yellow Wallpaper"".  With the growth of feminist criticism, ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" has become a standard text in many curricula. Feminists have made a significant contribution to the study of literature, according to Lanser, but she also remarks that if ""we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.""[11]

Martha J. Cutter points out that many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works address a ""struggle in which a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women"".[12]Gilman's works challenge the social construction of women by a patriarchal medical discourse that forced them to be ""silent, powerless, and passive"".[12]In the period in which Gilman wrote, women were frequently considered (and treated) as inferiors, prone to be sickly and weak. In this time period, it was thought that women who received formal education (amongst other causes) could develophysteria, a now-discredited[13]catchall term referring to most mental health diseases identified in women and erroneously believed to stem from a malfunctioning uterus (from the Greekhystera, ""womb""). At the time, the medical understanding was that women who spent time in serious intellectual pursuits (such as university education) over-stimulated their brains, which in turn led to states of hysteria. Many of the diseases diagnosed in women were considered to be a matter of a lack of self-control or self-rule. Medical practitioners argued that a physician must ""assume a tone of authority"" and that a ""cured"" woman is defined by being ""subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician"".[12]A hysterical woman craves power. To be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician, whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to ""tame"" them and keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for women, i.e., ""the rest cure"", has to do with how her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains: ""In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public.... It is a male voice that... imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's.""[14]The narrator in ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" is not allowed to participate in her treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one which forces control on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.[citation needed]

“The Yellow Wallpaper” often resembles a sub-category framework called ecogothic literature.Ecogothicis a relatively new literary and critical framework that explores the intersection of ecological concerns and Gothic tropes, particularly fear, dread, and the uncanny in representations of nature. Emerging prominently with the 2013 volumeEcogothicedited by Andrew Smith and William Hughes, the field builds upon earlier discussions, notably Simon C. Estok’s 2009 essay on ecophobia. A central concept in ecogothic isecophobia—the fear or contempt for nature—which is seen as foundational to the genre. Scholars like Dawn Keetley and Matthew Wynn Sivils emphasize that ecogothic literature reflects a deep anxiety stemming from humanity’s failure to control nature, aligning ecological fear with traditional Gothic themes of loss, powerlessness, and the unknown.

Through an ecogothic lens, ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" reveals how the natural world and the domestic environment become sites of psychological horror and oppression. The story reflects key ecogothic themes, particularly ecophobia which mirrors the protagonist’s growing fear of her surroundings and her deteriorating mental state. The room she is confined to, with its grotesque wallpaper, becomes a symbol of “human agency and a dislocation from ambulant human status…” Nature outside the house is present but unreachable, emphasizing the protagonist’s disconnection from both the natural world and her own autonomy. As her sense of control unravels, so does the barrier between the rational and the irrational—central concerns in both gothic and ecogothic narratives. Ultimately, the story illustrates how oppressive social structures and fear of the uncontrollable—whether within the mind or in the environment—intertwine to create a haunting, ecogothic atmosphere.

""The Yellow Wallpaper"" portrays a chilling entanglement of patriarchal violence, nature, and suppressed agency. John's desperate cry for an axe evokes not only domestic violence but also ecological destruction, linking the felling of trees to the silencing of women. The wallpaper—layered with remnants of a violently ended life—symbolizes both a barrier to liberation and a site of resistance. As the narrator emerges from the wallpaper, her act disrupts the walls that traditionally signify civilization and control, revealing the haunting histories hidden within domestic spaces. This ecogothic reading underscores how vegetal and feminine agency are suppressed by a civilization that is deeply complicit in erasing both, suggesting that madness becomes a form of rebellion against the silencing forces of patriarchy and ecophobia.

Through the lens of Gilbert and Gubar’s theory, the story becomes a feminist indictment of the systemic silencing of women. The narrator’s collapse is not caused solely by mental illness, but by a world that refuses to allow her any control over her body, her mind, or her surroundings. The final scene, in which she “creeps” over the unconscious body of her husband, is a powerful inversion of power — but it is also tragic, a descent into madness as the only way to reclaim a fragmented identity.

The themes in “The Yellow Wallpaper” parallel those in Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”, where protagonist Esther Greenwood similarly feels suffocated by societal expectations and gender norms. Esther’s internal conflict between her ambitions and traditional female roles leads her to contemplate — and attempt — suicide. Both protagonists are highly intelligent, emotionally sensitive women pushed to the edge by institutions that claim to know what’s best for them. Like Gilman’s narrator, Esther has no true outlet for her distress; she writes, “The silence depressed me. It wasn’t the silence of silence. It was my own silence” (Plath 20).

In both works, the female psyche is examined in isolation — one trapped in a colonial mansion, the other in the metaphorical “bell jar.” Esther, like the narrator ofThe Yellow Wallpaper, experiences a deepening dissociation between mind and body. She becomes alienated from her own image, even fantasizing about an alternate identity as “Elly Higginbottom” to escape her life. Her rejection of conventional femininity, and of marriage to Buddy Willard — a man who, like John, expects subservience and domesticity — echoes Gilman’s critique of patriarchal roles.

Each protagonist’s path toward breakdown is also shaped by theFoucauldiannotion of the medical gaze — the way institutions view mental illness through an impersonal, diagnostic lens that discounts lived experience. Esther’s traumatic electroshock treatment at the hands of Dr. Gordon mirrors the emotional trauma of the rest cure for Gilman’s narrator. Both women find some semblance of healing only through subversive action: tearing the wallpaper or rewriting their lives in fiction.

""The Yellow Wallpaper"" is sometimes cited as an example ofGothic literaturefor its themes of madness and powerlessness.[15]Alan Ryan introduced the story by writing: ""quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, and strongest, tales ofhorrorever written. It may be aghost story. Worse yet, it may not.""[16]Pioneering horror authorH. P. Lovecraftwrites in his essaySupernatural Horror in Literature(1927) that ""'The Yellow Wall Paper' rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a madwoman was once confined"".[17]

Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz wrote that ""the story was acri de coeuragainst Gilman's first husband, artistCharles Walter Stetsonand the traditional marriage he had demanded.""[18]Gilman attempted to deflect blame to protect her daughter Katharine and Stetson's second wifeGrace Ellery Channing, who was also Gilman's close friend and cousin.[19]Horowitz consults the sources of Charlotte's private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte's diaries for notes on her reading. She shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. Horowitz makes a case that ""The Yellow Wallpaper"", in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (a neurologist who treated Gilman in 1887) and his treatment. Rather, it emerged from Charlotte's troubled relationship with her husband Walter, personified in the story's physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.

In another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" is an allegory for Gilman's hatred of the emergingyellow journalism. Having createdThe Forerunnerin November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented thesensationalismof the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship with the press. The protagonist describes the wallpaper as having ""sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin"". Edelstein argues that given Gilman’s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.[20]

Paula A. Treichler focuses on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of ""...the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation ofneurasthenia, the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy"", Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the ""...sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes"". While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse. The woman found in the wallpaper could be the ""...representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak"". In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported by the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is why her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.[14]

Gilman was a major feminist figure during the turn of the 20th century. However, according to the Natural Library of Medicine, Gilman was considered aneugenicist.[21]Eugenics, in simple terms, is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of the population. This belief system that skyrocketed at the turn of the century and is heavily rooted inracism,xenophobia,antisemitism,ableism, and more.  Despite these beliefs, she is a big face of feminist literature and scholars are aware of her troubling ideologies while still acknowledging her role in the feminist movement at the time."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25344,The Scarlet Letter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter,"InPuritanBoston,Massachusetts, a crowd gathers to witness the punishment ofHester Prynne, a young woman who has given birth to a baby of unknown paternity. Her sentence requires her to stand on the scaffold of a formergallowsfor three hours, exposed to public humiliation, and to wear a scarlet ""A"" (standing for ""adultery"") for the rest of her life. As Hester approaches the scaffold, many of the women in the crowd are angered by her beauty and quiet dignity. When commanded to confess and name the father of her child, Hester refuses.

As Hester looks out over the crowd, she notices a small, misshapen man and recognizes the man as her long-lost husband, who had been presumed lost at sea. When Hester's long-lost husband sees her shame, he asks a man in the crowd about her and is told the story of his wife's pregnancy. He angrily exclaims that the child's father should also be punished for his immoral act and vows to find the man. He chooses a new name,Roger Chillingworth, to aid him in his plan.

The Reverend John Wilson and the minister of Hester's church,Arthur Dimmesdale, question her, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Chillingworth, now a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage and the fact that they were both in the wrong. Chillingworth demands to know who fathered Hester's child, but Hester refuses to divulge that information. He accepts Hester's refusal, stating that he will find out the man's identity anyway. Chillingworth threatens to destroy the father of Hester's child if Hester ever reveals the fact that Chillingworth is her husband. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms, although she suspects she will regret it.

Following her release from prison, Hester settles in a cottage at the edge of town and earns a meager living with her needlework, which is of extraordinary quality. She lives a quiet, somber life with her daughter, Pearl, and performs acts of charity for the poor. She is troubled by her daughter's unusual fascination with the scarlet ""A"". The shunning of Hester also extends to Pearl, who has no playmates or friends except her mother. As she grows older, Pearl becomes capricious and unruly. Her conduct sparks controversy, and the church members suggest Pearl be taken away from Hester. Hester, hearing that she may lose Pearl, goes to speak toGovernor Bellinghamand ministers Wilson and Dimmesdale. Hester appeals to Dimmesdale in desperation, and the minister persuades the governor to let Pearl remain in Hester's care.

Because Dimmesdale's health has begun to fail, the townspeople are happy to have Chillingworth, the newly arrived physician, take up lodgings with their beloved minister. In close contact with Dimmesdale, Chillingworth begins to suspect that the minister's illness is the result of unconfessed guilt. He applies psychological pressure to the minister because he suspects Dimmesdale is Pearl's father. One evening, pulling the sleeping Dimmesdale'svestmentaside, Chillingworth sees a symbol that represents his shame on the minister's pale chest.

Tormented by his guilty conscience, Dimmesdale goes to the square where Hester was punished years earlier. Climbing the scaffold in the dead of night, he admits his guilt but cannot find the courage to do so publicly in the light of day. Hester, shocked by Dimmesdale's deterioration, decides to obtain a release from her vow of silence to her husband.

Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest and tells him of her husband and his desire for revenge. She convinces Dimmesdale to leave Boston in secret on a ship to Europe where they can start life anew. Inspired by this plan, the minister seems to gain energy.

On Election Day, Dimmesdale gives one of his most inspired sermons. As the procession leaves the church, however, Dimmesdale climbs upon the scaffold, confesses his sin, and dies in Hester's arms. Later, most witnesses swear that they saw a stigma in the form of a scarlet ""A"" upon his chest, although some deny this statement. Chillingworth loses his vengeance and dies within a year, leaving Pearl a substantial inheritance both in New England as well as in Europe; Hester and Pearl  leave for Europe shortly thereafter.

After several years, Hester returns to her cottage without Pearl and resumes wearing the scarlet letter. When she dies, she is buried near the grave of Dimmesdale, and they share a simple slate tombstone engraved with an epitaph described as: ""On a field,sable, the letter A,gules"" (“On a black background, the letter A in red"").

Elmer Kennedy-Andrews remarks that Hawthorne in ""The Customhouse"" sets the context for his story and ""tells us about 'romance', which is his preferred generic term to describeThe Scarlet Letter, as his subtitle for the book– 'A Romance'– would indicate."" In this introduction, Hawthorne describes a space between materialism and ""dreaminess"" that he calls ""a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairyland, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbues itself with nature of the other"". This combination of ""dreaminess"" and realism gave the author space to explore major themes.[7]

The experience of Prynne and Dimmesdale recalls the story ofAdam and Evebecause, in both cases, sin results in expulsion and suffering. But it also results in knowledge – specifically, in knowledge of what it means to be immoral. For Prynne, the Scarlet Letter is a physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude. She contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and a checkered past as well as the absence of God. Because the society excludes her, she considers the possibility that many of the traditions upheld by the Puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness.[8]

As for Dimmesdale, the ""cheating minister"", his sin gives him ""sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind"" ""that his chest vibrate[s] in unison with theirs."" His eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy.[9]The Dimmesdale narrative is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles inChristian thought.[8]His ""fall"" is a descent from apparent grace to his own damnation; he appears to begin in purity, but he ends in corruption. The subtlety is that the minister's belief is his own cheating, convincing himself at every stage of his spiritualpilgrimagethat he is saved.[10]

Throughout the work, the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the Puritans and their systems. A rose bush's beauty forms a striking contrast to all that surrounds it. Later, the beautifully embroidered scarlet ""A"" is held out in part as an invitation to find ""some sweet moral blossom"" in the ensuing, tragic tale and in part as an image that ""the deep heart of nature"" (perhaps God) may look kindlier on the errant Prynne and her child than her Puritan neighbors do.[11]

Chillingworth's misshapen body reflects (or symbolizes) the anger in his soul, just as Dimmesdale's illness reveals his inner turmoil. The outward man reflects the condition of the heart. This observation is thought to have been inspired by the deterioration ofEdgar Allan Poe, whom Hawthorne ""much admired"".[11]

Another theme is the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Prynne chose not to conform to their rules and beliefs. Prynne was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor. Because she was shunned, she spent her life mostly in solitude and did not attend church. Instead, she retreated into her own mind and her own thinking. Her thoughts began to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe. She still saw her sin, but she began to look on it differently than the villagers did. Prynne began to believe that a person's earthly sins do not necessarily condemn them. She even went so far as to tell Dimmesdale that their sin had been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin would not prevent them from reaching heaven.[8]

Prynne was alienated from Puritan society, both in her physical life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale died, she knew she had to move on because she could no longer conform to the Puritans' strictness. Her thinking was free from Puritan religious bounds, and she had established her own moral standards and beliefs.[9]

The Scarlet Letterwas first published in the spring of 1850 byTicknor and Fields, beginning Hawthorne's most lucrative period.[3]When he delivered the final pages to Fields in February 1850, Hawthorne said that ""some portions of the book are powerfully written"" but doubted it would be popular.[12]In fact, the book was an instant best-seller, though, over fourteen years, it brought its author only $1,500.[3]Its initial publication brought wide protest from natives of Salem, who did not approve of how Hawthorne had depicted them in his introduction ""The Custom-House"". A 2,500-copy second edition included a preface by Hawthorne dated March 30, 1850, that stated he had decided to reprint his Introduction ""without the change of a word... The only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good humor... As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives"".[13]

Hawthorne wrote the manuscript at the Peter Edgerley House inSalem, Massachusetts, still standing as a private residence at 14 Mall Street. It was the last Salem home where the Hawthorne family lived.[14]

The Scarlet Letterwas also one of the first mass-produced books in America. In the mid-nineteenth century, bookbinders of home-grown literature typically hand-made their books and sold them in small quantities. The first mechanized printing ofThe Scarlet Letter, 2,500 volumes, sold out within ten days.[3]

It was long held that Hawthorne originally plannedThe Scarlet Letterto be a shorternovelette, part of a collection namedOld Time Legends, and that his publisher,James T. Fields, convinced him to expand the work to a full-length novel.[15]This is not true: Fields persuaded Hawthorne to publishThe Scarlet Letteralone (along with the earlier-completed ""Custom House"" essay) but he had nothing to do with the length of the story.[16]Hawthorne's wifeSophialater challenged Fields' claims a little inexactly: ""he has made the absurd boast thathewas the sole cause of the Scarlet Letter being published!"" She noted that her husband's friendEdwin Percy Whipple, a critic, approached Fields to consider its publication.[17]

A signed first edition, first printing ofScarlet Letterfrom March 1850 published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields sold for $22,500. Unsigned, the retail price was estimated in 2014 at $12,500.[18]

On its publication, criticEvert Augustus Duyckinck, a friend of Hawthorne's, said he preferred the author'sWashington Irving-like tales. Another friend, criticEdwin Percy Whipple, objected to the novel's ""morbid intensity"" with dense psychological details, writing that the book ""is therefore apt to become, like Hawthorne, too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them"".[19]English writerMary Anne Evanswriting as ""George Eliot"", calledThe Scarlet Letter, along withHenry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1855 book-length poemThe Song of Hiawatha, the ""two most indigenous and masterly productions in American literature"".[20]Most literary critics praised the book but religious leaders took issue with the novel's subject matter.[21]Orestes Brownsoncomplained that Hawthorne did not understand Christianity, confession, and remorse.[22]A review inThe Church Review and Ecclesiastical Registerconcluded the author ""perpetrates bad morals.""[23]

On the other hand, 20th-century writerD. H. Lawrencesaid that there could not be a more perfect work of the American imagination thanThe Scarlet Letter.[24]Henry Jamesonce said of the novel, ""It is beautiful, admirable, extraordinary; it has in the highest degree that merit which I have spoken of as the mark of Hawthorne's best things—an indefinable purity and lightness of conception...One can often return to it; it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art.""[24][25]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes,"All of the stories withinThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesare told in afirst-person narrativefrom the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories.[7]TheOxford Dictionary of National Biographyentry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmestend to point out social injustices, such as ""a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent.""[1]It suggests that, in contrast,  Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of ""official incompetence and aristocratic privilege"".[1]The Adventures of Sherlock Holmescontains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories toThe Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"" (as his favourite), ""The Red-Headed League"" (second), ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (fifth) and ""The Five Orange Pips"" (seventh).[8]The book was banned in theSoviet Unionin 1929 because of its alleged ""occultism"",[9]but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.[10]

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being ""worthy of the inventive genius"" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it ""might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago"", but that ""the unique power"" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, ""with all his little foibles"",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as ""rather a bore sometimes"", noting that descriptions of his foibles ""grows wearisome"".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author ""who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want"".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: ""It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.""[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes ""the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.""[34]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28054,The Brothers Karamazov,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov,"The opening of the novel introduces the Karamazov family and relates the story of their distant and recent past. The details of Fyodor Pavlovich's two marriages, as well as his indifference to the upbringing of his three children, is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to their father's town. The first book concludes by describing the mysteriousEastern Orthodoxtradition of theElders. Alyosha has become devoted to the Elder at the local monastery.

Book Two begins as the Karamazov family arrives at the monastery so that the Elder Zosima can act as a mediator between Dmitri and his father in their dispute over the inheritance. It was the father's idea, apparently as a joke, to have the meeting take place in such a holy place in the presence of the famous Elder. Fyodor Pavlovich's deliberately insulting and provocative behaviour destroys any chance of conciliation, and the meeting only results in intensified hatred and a scandal. This book also contains a scene in which the Elder Zosima consoles a woman mourning the death of her three-year-old son. The poor woman's grief parallels Dostoevsky's own tragedy at the loss of his young son Alyosha.

The third book provides more details of the love triangle among Fyodor Pavlovich, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka. Dmitri hides near his father's home to see if Grushenka will arrive. His personality is explored in a long conversation with Alyosha. Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father's house and assaults him. As he leaves, he threatens to come back and kill him. This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Lizaveta Smerdyashchaya. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka's humiliation of Dmitri's betrothed Katerina Ivanovna.

This section introduces a side story which resurfaces in more detail later in the novel. It begins with Alyosha observing a group of schoolboys throwing rocks at one of their sickly peers named Ilyusha. When Alyosha admonishes the boys and tries to help, Ilyusha bites Alyosha's finger. It is later learned that Ilyusha's father, a former staff-captain named Snegiryov, was assaulted by Dmitri, who dragged him by the beard out of a bar. Alyosha soon learns of the further hardships present in the Snegiryov household and offers the former staff captain money as an apology for his brother and to help Snegiryov's ailing wife and children. After initially accepting the money with joy, Snegiryov throws it to the ground and stomps it into the sand, before running back into his home.

Here, therationalistandnihilisticideology that permeated Russia at this time is defended and espoused by Ivan Karamazov while meeting his brother Alyosha at a restaurant. In the chapter titled ""Rebellion"", Ivan proclaims that he rejects the world that God has created because it is built on a foundation of suffering. In perhaps the most famous chapter in the novel, ""The Grand Inquisitor"", Ivan narrates to Alyosha his imagined poem that describes an encounter between a leader from theSpanish InquisitionandJesus, who has made his return to Earth. The opposition between reason and faith is dramatised and symbolised in a forceful monologue of the Grand Inquisitor who, having ordered the arrest of Jesus, visits him in prison at night.

The Grand Inquisitor accuses Jesus of having inflicted on humankind the ""burden"" of free will. At the end of the Grand Inquisitor's lengthy arguments, Jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old man on the lips. The Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells him he must never come there again, and lets him out. Alyosha, after hearing the story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight. The brothers part with mutual affection and respect.

The sixth book relates the life and history of the Elder Zosima as he lies near death in hiscell. Zosima explains that he found his faith in his rebellious youth, after an unforgivable action toward his trusted servant, consequently deciding to become a monk. Zosima preaches people must forgive others by acknowledging their ownsinsand guilt before others. He explains that no sin is isolated, making everyone responsible for their neighbor's sins. Zosima represents a philosophy that responds to Ivan's, which had challenged God's creation in the previous book.

The book begins immediately following the death of Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town and the monastery that true holy men's bodies areincorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb toputrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It therefore comes as a great shock that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost immediately following his death. Within the first day, the smell is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery—Rakitin—uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he acquires new faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces and kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively. Renewed, he goes back out into the world, as his Elder instructed.

This section deals primarily with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money for the purpose of running away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina Ivanovna, and will believe himself to be a thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. Dmitri approaches Grushenka's benefactor, Samsonov, who sends him to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his father and marry him because of his wealth and lavish promises. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor's home, but later discovers that she has deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father's home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. There is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running from his father's property. The servant Gregory tries to stop him, yelling ""Parricide!"", but Dmitri hits him in the head with the pestle. Dmitri, afraid that the blow might have killed Grigori, tries to attend to the wound with his handkerchief, but gives up and runs away.

Dmitri is next seen in a daze on the street, covered in blood, with a pile of money in his hand. He soon learns that Grushenka's former betrothed has returned and taken her to a nearby lodge. Upon learning this, Dmitri loads a cart with food and wine and pays for a huge orgy to finally confront Grushenka in the presence of her old flame, intending all the while to kill himself at dawn. The ""first and rightful lover"" is a boorish Pole who cheats the party at a game of cards. When his deception is revealed, he flees, and Grushenka soon reveals to Dmitri that she really is in love with him.  The party rages on, and just as Dmitri and Grushenka are making plans to marry, the police enter the lodge and inform Dmitri that he is under arrest for the murder of his father.

Book Nine introduces the details of Fyodor Pavlovich's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri, who vigorously maintains his innocence. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was known to have been completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Pavlovich had set aside for Grushenka have disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles that Katerina Ivanovna gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina Ivanovna. The investigators are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points toward Dmitri; the only other person in the house at the time of the murder, apart from Gregory and his wife, was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the murder and taken away to prison to await trial.

Boyscontinues the story of the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims hisatheism,socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. Dostoevsky uses Kolya's beliefs, especially in a conversation with Alyosha, to satirize hisWesternizercritics by putting their words and beliefs in the mouth of a young boy who doesn't really understand what he is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a local dog: Ilyusha had fed it a piece of bread in which he had placed a pin, at the bidding of Smerdyakov. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.

Book Eleven chronicles Ivan Fyodorovich's influence on those around him and his descent into madness. It is in this book that Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov, desperately seeking to solve the riddle of the murder and whether Smerdyakov, and consequently he himself, had anything to do with it. In the final meeting Smerdyakov confesses that he had faked the fit, murdered Fyodor Pavlovich, and stolen the money, which he presents to Ivan. Smerdyakov expresses disbelief at Ivan's professed ignorance and surprise. Smerdyakov claims that Ivan was complicit in the murder by telling Smerdyakov when he would be leaving Fyodor Pavlovich's house, and more importantly by instilling in Smerdyakov the belief that, in a world without God, ""everything is permitted."" The book ends with Ivan having a hallucination in which he is visited by the devil, in the form of an idle and parasitic former gentleman,  who torments him by personifying and caricaturing his thoughts and ideas. The nightmare is interrupted by a knocking at the window: it is Alyosha, who has come to inform him that Smerdyakov has hanged himself. Although the devil disappears, Ivan remains in a delirium and converses irrationally. Alyosha is shocked at his brother's condition and tries to pacify him, but Ivan's ravings become increasingly incoherent. Eventually he falls into a deep sleep.

This book details the trial of Dmitri Karamazov for the murder of his father. The courtroom drama is sharply satirized by Dostoevsky. The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the women as irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri's love triangle with Katerina and Grushenka. Ivan's madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after his attempt to give evidence about Smerdyakov descends into incomprehensible raving. The turning point in the trial is Katerina's damning testimony. Shocked by Ivan's madness, she passionately defends him and abandons her 'honourable' approach to Dmitri. She produces a letter drunkenly written by Dmitri saying that he would kill his father. The section concludes with lengthy and impassioned closing remarks from the prosecutor and the defence counsel and the verdict that Dmitri is guilty.

The final section opens with discussion of a plan developed for Dmitri's escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor inSiberia. The plan is never fully described, but it seems to involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha cautiously approves, because he feels that Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, that he is innocent, and that no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then return to Russia under assumed American names, because they cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness, before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha's funeral, where Ilyusha's schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha's ""Speech by the Stone"". Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed. He implores them to love each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will keep each other in their memories forever. They join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting ""Hurrah for Karamazov!""

One of the novel's central themes is the counterposition of the true spiritual meaning of the Orthodox Christian faith, particularly insofar as it is posited as the heart of Russian national identity and history, with the ideas and values emanating from the new doctrines of atheism, rationalism, socialism and nihilism. Not only were these ideas and values alien to Russia's spiritual heritage, they were, in Dostoevsky's opinion, actively working to destroy it, and moreover were becoming increasingly popular and influential, especially among Russia's youth.[15]The theme had already been vividly depicted in all the earlier major novels, particularlyDemons, but inThe Brothers KaramazovDostoevsky artistically represents and counterposes the two antithetical worldviews in archetypal forms — the character of Ivan Fyodorovich and his legend ofThe Grand Inquisitor, and the characters of Alyosha and the Elder Zosima in their expression and embodiment of alivedChristian faith.

The character of Ivan Fyodorovich, though he outwardly plays the role of devil's advocate, is inwardly far from being resolved in his atheism. A constantly reappearing motif in the novel is his proposition that without faith in immortality, there is no such thing as virtue, and that if there is no God,everythingis permitted. When Zosima encounters the idea in the meeting at the monastery, he doesn't dispute it, but suggests to Ivan that since in all probability he doesn't believe in the immortality of his own soul, his thoughts must be a source of torment to him: ""But the martyr likes sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair itself. Meanwhile ... you divert yourself with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly.... That question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.""[16]In his relations with Ivan, Alyosha consciously personifies the loving voice of faith that he knows lives in his brother's soul, in opposition to the mocking voice of doubt that ultimately becomes personified in the nightmare of the Devil.[17]Alyosha says of Ivan ""His mind is a prisoner of his soul. There is a great and unresolved thought in him. He is one of those who don't need millions, they just need to get a thought straight.""[18]

Dostoevsky wrote to his editor that his intention with book V, ""Pro and Contra"", was to portray ""the seed of the idea of destruction in our time in Russia among the young people uprooted from reality"". This seed is depicted as: ""the rejection not of God but of the meaning of His creation. Socialism has sprung from the denial of the meaning of historical reality and ended in a program of destruction and anarchism.""[19]In the chapter ""Rebellion"", the rationale behind Ivan's rejection of God's world is expounded in a long dialogue with Alyosha, in which he justifies his atheism on the grounds of the very principle—universal love and compassion—that is at the heart of the Christian faith. The unmitigated evil in the world, particularly as it relates to the suffering of children, is not something thatcanbe accepted by a heart steeped in love, so Ivan feels bound in his conscience to ""humbly return the ticket"" to God. The idea of the refusal of love on the grounds of love is taken further in the subsequent ""Legend of the Grand Inquisitor"". In a long dialogue, in which the second participant (the returned Christ) remains silent for its entire duration, the Inquisitor rejects the freedom and spiritual beauty of Christ's teaching as being beyond the capability of earthly humanity, and affirms instead the bread-and-chains materialism derived from the Devil'sTemptationsas being the only realistic and truly compassionate basis for the government of men.[20]The Legend is Ivan's confession of the struggle of ""pro and contra"" taking place within his own soul in relation to the problem of faith. According to Mikhail Bakhtin, ""both the very form of its construction as The Grand Inquisitor's dialogue with Christ and at the same time with himself, and the very unexpectedness and duality of its finale, indicate an internally dialogic disintegration at its ideological core.""[21]

With Book VI, ""The Russian Monk"", Dostoevsky sought to provide the refutation of Ivan's negation of God, through the teachings of the dying Elder, Zosima.[22]The dark world of the Inquisitor's reasoning is juxtaposed with the radiant, idyllically stylized communications of the dying Elder and Alyosha's renderings of his life and teachings.[23][24]Zosima, though suffering and near death, unreservedly communicates his love for those around him, and recounts the stories of the crucial moments in his progress along the spiritual path. Alyosha records these accounts for posterity, as well as the Elder's teachings and discourses on various subjects, including: the significance of the Russian Monk; spiritual brotherhood between masters and servants; the impossibility of judging one's fellow creatures; Faith, Prayer, Love, and Contiguity with Other Worlds; and the spiritual meaning of 'hell' as the suffering of being unable to Love. Dostoevsky based Zosima's teachings on those of the 18th century Orthodox saint and spiritual writerTikhon of Zadonsk, and constructed them around his own formulation of the essence of a true Christian faith: that all are responsible for all, and that ""everyone is guilty before all and for everything, andthereforeeveryone is strong enough also to forgive everything for others"". He was acutely aware of the difficulty of the artistic task he had set himself and of the incompatibility of the form and content of his ""reply"" with ordinary discourse and the everyday concerns of his contemporaries.[25]

Throughout the novel, in the very nature of all the characters and their interactions, the freedom of the human personality is affirmed, in opposition to any form of deterministic reduction. The ""physiologism"" that is being attacked is identified in the repeated references toClaude Bernard, who becomes for Dmitri a despised symbol of the scientific reduction of the human soul to impersonal physiological processes. For Dmitri the word 'Bernard' becomes the most contemptuous of insults. References to Bernard are in part a response toZola's theories about heredity and environment, gleaned from Bernard's ideas, which functioned as the ideological background to theLes Rougon-Macquartseries of novels.[27]

Though the affirmation of freedom and rejection of mechanistic psychology is most openly and forcefully expressed through the character of Dmitri, as a theme it pervades the entire novel and virtually all of Dostoevsky's other writings. Bakhtin discusses it in terms of what he calls theunfinalizabilityof Dostoevsky's characters. In Dostoevsky, a fundamental refusal to be wholly defined by an external source (another person, a social interpretation, an ideology, a system of 'knowledge', or anything at all that places a finalizing limit on the primordial freedom of the living soul, including even death) is at the heart of the character. He sees this quality as essential to the human being, tobeing human, and in his most fiercely independent characters, such as Ivan and Dmitri inThe Brothers Karamazov, Raskolnikov inCrime and Punishment, Nastasya Filippovna and Ippolit inThe Idiot, or the Underground man inNotes From Underground, it is actively expressed in virtually all their words and deeds.[28]According to Bakhtin, for Dostoevsky:

Although written in the 19th century,The Brothers Karamazovdisplays a number of modern elements. Dostoevsky composed the book with a variety ofliterary techniques. Though privy to many of the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the narrator is a self-proclaimed writer; he discusses his own mannerisms and personal perceptions so often in the novel that he becomes a character. Through his descriptions, the narrator's voice merges imperceptibly into the tone of the people he is describing, often extending into the characters' most personal thoughts. There is no voice of authority in the story.[i]In addition to the principal narrator, there are several sections narrated by other characters entirely, such as the story ofThe Grand Inquisitorand Zosima's confessions.

Dostoevsky uses individual styles of speech to express the inner personality of each person. For example, the attorney Fetyukovich (based onVladimir Spasovich) is characterized bymalapropisms(e.g. 'robbed' for 'stolen', and at one point declares possible suspects in the murder 'irresponsible' rather than innocent).[citation needed]Several plot digressions provide insight into other apparently minor characters. For example, the narrative in Book Six is almost entirely devoted to Zosima's biography, which contains a confession from a man whom he met many years before. Dostoevsky does not rely on a single source or a group of major characters to convey the themes of this book, but uses a variety of viewpoints, narratives and characters throughout.

The Brothers Karamazovhas had a deep influence on many public figures over the years for widely varying reasons. Admirers include scientists such asAlbert Einstein,[29]philosophersLudwig Wittgenstein[30]andMartin Heidegger,[31]as well as writers such asVirginia Woolf,[32]Cormac McCarthy,[33]Haruki Murakami,[34]andFrederick Buechner.[35]

British writerC. P. Snowwrites of Einstein's admiration for the novel: ""The Brothers Karamazov—that for him in 1919 was the supreme summit of all literature. It remained so when I talked to him in 1937, and probably until the end of his life.""[36]

Sigmund Freudcalled it ""the most magnificent novel ever written"" and was fascinated with what he saw as itsOedipalthemes. In 1928 Freud published a paper titled ""Dostoevsky and Parricide"" in which he investigated Dostoevsky's ownneuroses.[37]Freud claimed that Dostoevsky'sepilepsywas not a natural condition but instead a physical manifestation of the author's hidden guilt over his own father's death. According to Freud, Dostoevsky (and all other sons) wished for the death of his father because of latent desire for his mother; citing the fact that Dostoevsky'sepileptic fitsbegan at age 18, the year his father died. It followed that more obvious themes of patricide and guilt, especially in the form of the moral guilt illustrated by Ivan Karamazov, were further literary evidence of his theory.

Franz Kafkafelt indebted to Dostoevsky andThe Brothers Karamazov, calling himself and Dostoevsky ""blood relatives"" and was immensely interested in the hatred the brothers demonstrated toward their father in the novel. He probably found parallels with his own strained father-son relationship and drew on this theme to some extent in his works, especially the short story ""The Judgment"").[38]

James Joycewrote:

Not all reception to the book was positive. Some were critical of it, such asHenry James,Vladimir Nabokov,D. H. Lawrence, andPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.[40]Tchaikovsky, for instance, once said of the novel in a letter that ""Dostoyevsky is a writer of genius, but an antipathetic one.""[41]

As for Leo Tolstoy himself, the work appears to have proved both challenging and provocative. Entries from his journal indicate that, like others, he considered Dostoevsky's idiosyncratic style to be an obstacle, yet the book was one of several that he requested accompany him on his deathbed.[42]

The philosopherLudwig Wittgensteinis said to have readThe Brothers Karamazov""so often he knew whole passages of it by heart"".[43]A copy of the novel was one of the few possessions Wittgenstein brought with him to thefrontduringWorld War I.[43]

Martin Heideggeridentified Dostoevsky's thought as one of the most important sources for his early and best known book,Being and Time.[44]Of the two portraits Heidegger kept on the wall of his office, one was of Dostoevsky.[45][page needed]

According to philosopherCharles B. Guignon, the novel's most fascinating character, Ivan Karamazov, had by the middle of the twentieth century become the icon of existentialist rebellion in the writings of existentialist philosophersAlbert CamusandJean-Paul Sartre.[45][page needed]Camus centered on a discussion of Ivan Karamazov's revolt in his 1951 bookRebel. Ivan's poem ""The Grand Inquisitor"" is arguably one of the best-known passages in modern literature due to its ideas about human nature, freedom, power, authority, and religion, as well as for its fundamental ambiguity.[45][page needed]A reference to the poem can be found in English novelistAldous Huxley'sBrave New World Revisitedand American writerDavid Foster Wallace's novelInfinite Jest.

Nobel PrizelaureateWilliam Faulknerreread the book regularly, claiming it as his greatest literary inspiration next toShakespeare's works and theBible. He once wrote that American literature had yet to produce anything great enough to compare with Dostoyevsky's novel.[32]

In an essay onThe Brothers Karamazov,written after theRussian Revolutionand theFirst World War, Nobel Prize-winning authorHermann Hessedescribed Dostoevsky as not a ""poet"" but a ""prophet"".[46]British writerW. Somerset Maughamincluded the book in hislist of ten greatest novels in the world.[47]

ContemporaryTurkishNobel Prize-winning writerOrhan Pamuksaid during a lecture inSt. Petersburgthat the first time he readThe Brothers Karamazov, his life was changed. He felt Dostoyevsky, through his storytelling, revealed completely unique insight into life and human nature.[32]

Americanphilosophical novelistWalker Percysaid in an interview:[48]

Pope Benedict XVIcited the book in the 2007encyclicalSpe Salvi.[49]

SovietleaderJoseph Stalinhad read Dostoevsky since his youth and considered the author as a great psychologist. His copy ofThe Brothers Karamazovreveals extensive highlights and notes in the margins that he made while reading the work, which have been studied and analyzed by multiple researchers.[50][51]

According to Serbian state news agencyTanjug, Serbian presidentAleksandar Vučićdescribed Dostoevsky as his best-loved novelist, saying: ""The Brothers Karamazovmay be the best work ofworld literature.""[52]American First LadyLaura Bushhas said she is an admirer of the novel.[53]

AlthoughThe Brothers Karamazovhas been translated from the original Russian into a number of languages, the novel's diverse array of distinct voices and literary techniques makes its translation difficult.Constance Garnettpublished a translation in 1912, which Garth Terry called ""the first adequate English translation"".[54]An earlier version (byIsabel Florence Hapgood) was published in 1905.

In 1958,David MagarshackandManuel Komroffreleased translations of the novel, published respectively by Penguin andThe New American Library of World Literature.[55]In 1976, Ralph Matlaw thoroughly revised Garnett's work for his Norton Critical Edition volume.[56]This in turn was the basis for Victor Terras' influentialA Karamazov Companion.[57]Another translation is byJulius Katzer, published byProgress Publishersin 1981 and later re-printed by Raduga Publishers Moscow.

In 1990Richard PevearandLarissa Volokhonskyreleased a new translation; it won a PEN/Book-of-the-Month ClubTranslation Prize in 1991 and garnered positive reviews fromThe New York Times Book Reviewand the Dostoevsky scholarJoseph Frank, who praised it for being the most faithful to Dostoevsky's original Russian.[58]

InThe Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translations, academicPeter Francecomments on several translations of Dostoevsky's work. In regard to Constance Garnett's translations, he writes:[59]

OnDavid Magarshack's Dostoevsky translations, France says:[60]

On Andrew R. MacAndrew's American version, he comments: ""He translates fairly freely, altering details, rearranging, shortening and explaining the Russian to produce texts which lack a distinctive voice.""[60]

OnDavid McDuff's Penguin translation:[61]

On the Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation, France writes:[62]

In commenting on Ignat Avsey's translation, he writes: ""His not entirely unprecedented choice of a more natural-sounding English formulation is symptomatic of his general desire to make his text English...His is an enjoyable version in the domesticating tradition.""[62]

This is a list of all unabridged and one abridged English translations of the novel:[64][65]

There have been several film adaptations ofThe Brothers Karamazov, including:

A Russian12-episode serieswas produced in 2009 and is considered to be as close to the book as possible.[70]It aired on Channel One.

The 2013 Japanese TV dramaKaramazov no Kyōdaiis an adaptation of the book set in modern-day Japan.

The Open University produced a version of ""The Grand Inquisitor"" in 1975 starringJohn Gielgud.[71]

""The Grand Inquisitor"" was adapted for British television as a one-hour drama titledInquisition. StarringDerek Jacobias the inquisitor, it was first broadcast on Channel 5 on 22 December 2002.

A 30-episode drama series namedOulad El Moukhtar('Mokhtar's Sons') was produced byNabil AyouchforAl Aoulain 2020. The adaptation of the book is set in Morocco, with some aspects changed to resemble the local Moroccan culture.[72]

A sequel toThe Brothers Karamazovthat would detail the life of Alexey Karamazov beyond the ending of what was supposed to be the first novel had been planned out by Dostoevsky, but was left unfinished due to the author's death in 1881.[73]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41445,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein,"Victor Frankenstein, son of an upper-classGenevesefamily, spends his youth obsessed withalchemy. As he grows older, he develops an interest in modern sciences such aschemistryandelectricity. After his mother Caroline dies ofscarlet fever, Victor leaves home to attend theUniversity of Ingolstadt. Through his studies, Victor discovers a new way to create life, which he uses to create alarge and grotesque humanoid creature. Whenthe creatureawakens, Victor flees in terror. He returns to find the creature gone.

The newly conscious creature runs away, discovers fire, and learns to avoid humans, who find him frightening. He finds ahovelattached to a small house, which lets him observe a family while remaining unseen. As the family teaches their language to a foreigner, the creature also learns to speak and write. He also finds a collection of books, includingParadise Lost, and learns to read. When he finally reveals himself to the family, they are horrified by his appearance and chase him away. The creature then saves a young girl from drowning, only to be shot by her father, who perceives his rescue as an attack.

Angry at humanity, the creature returns to Geneva to find Victor, and instead meets Victor's brother William. Realizing that William belongs to the same family, the creature kills him, then frames the Frankensteins' servant Justine for his death. Victor suspects his creature was responsible, but does not intervene while Justine is tried and executed. Later, while hiking onMer de Glace, Victor encounters the creature again. The creature relays his story and asks Victor to create a female companion, which he believes will be his only chance at happiness. Victor agrees.

Victor and his friend Henry Clerval leave the European mainland forBritain, where Victor establishes a laboratory inOrkney. While working on the female creature, Victor worries about his creations giving birth, and decides to destroy the incomplete female instead. In retaliation, the original creature murders Henry. Victor suffers a mental breakdown, then returns home. Back in Geneva, Victor marries his childhood friendElizabeth Lavenza, only for the creature to murder her on the wedding night. Days later, Victor's father Alphonse dies of grief. With no remaining family, Victor vows revenge and pursues the creature, eventually following him to theArctic.

Chasing the creature across Arctic ice, Victor nearly dies from exhaustion andhypothermia. He is rescued by Captain Robert Walton, who is leading an expedition to the North Pole. Victor recounts his story to Walton and encourages the crew to continue their expedition; instead, they decide to abandon their journey and turn back. Victor vows to continue chasing the creature, but in his weakened state, he dies aboard the ship. As the ship leaves the Arctic, the creature comes onboard. He mourns Victor's death, tells Walton he plans to burn himself on a pyre, and then departs to build a pyre.

Mary Shelley's mother,Mary Wollstonecraft, died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her. Shelley grew close to her father,William Godwin, having never known her mother. Godwin hired a nurse, who briefly cared for her and her half sister, before marrying his second wifeMary Jane Clairmont, who did not like the close bond between Shelley and her father. The resulting friction caused Godwin to favour his other children.

Shelley's father was a famous author of the time, and her education was of great importance to him, although it was not formal. Shelley grew up surrounded by her father's friends, writers, and persons of political importance, who often gathered at the family home. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Mary, at the age of sixteen, met Percy Bysshe Shelley (who later became her husband) while he was visiting her father. Godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older, married man, so they fled to France along with her stepsister,Claire Clairmont. On 22 February 1815, Shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child, Clara, who died two weeks later.[10]

In thesummer of 1816, Mary, Percy, and Claire took a trip to visit Claire's lover, Lord Byron, inGeneva. Poor weather conditions, more akin to winter, forced Byron and the visitors to stay indoors. To help pass time, Byron suggested that he, Mary, Percy, and Byron's physician,John Polidori, have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors.[11]Mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation ofFrankenstein.[12][13]

Shelley's work was heavily influenced by that of her parents. Her father was famous forEnquiry Concerning Political Justiceand her mother famous forA Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Her father's novels also influenced her writing ofFrankenstein. These novels includedThings as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams,St. Leon, andFleetwood. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting inFrankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear inFrankensteinarePygmalionet Galatéeby Mme de Genlis, andOvid, with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society.[14]Ovid also inspires the use ofPrometheusin Shelley's title.[15]

The influence ofJohn Milton'sParadise LostandSamuel Taylor Coleridge'sThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerare evident in the novel. InThe Frankenstein of the French Revolution, author Julia Douthwaite posits that Shelley probably acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character fromHumphry Davy's bookElements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that,

References to theFrench Revolutionrun through the novel; a likely source isFrançois-Félix Nogaret[fr]'sLe Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant(1790), a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn, who creates a life-sized automaton.[16]

Both Frankenstein and the monster quote passages from Percy Shelley's 1816 poem, ""Mutability"", and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. Percy Shelley's name never appeared as the author of the poem, although the novel credits other quoted poets by name.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" (1798) is associated with the theme of guilt andWilliam Wordsworth's ""Tintern Abbey"" (1798) with that of innocence.

Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then-popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work because of several notable similarities. Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries wereGiovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London,[17]andJohann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

Ideas about life and death discussed by Percy and Byron were of great interest to scientists of that time. They discussed ideas fromErasmus Darwinand the experiments ofLuigi Galvanias well asJames Lind.[18]Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin, Galvani and perhaps Lind were present in her novel.

Shelley's personal experiences also influenced the themes withinFrankenstein. The themes of loss, guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance. In a 1965 issue ofThe Journal of Religion and Healtha psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.[13]

During the rainy summer of 1816, the ""Year Without a Summer"", the world was locked in a long, coldvolcanic wintercaused by the eruption ofMount Tamborain 1815.[19][20]Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and future husband),Percy Bysshe Shelley, visitedLord Byronat theVilla DiodatibyLake Geneva, in Switzerland'sAlps. The weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the bookFantasmagoriana.[21]Byron proposed that they ""each write a ghost story.""[22]Unable to think of a story, Mary Shelley became anxious. She recalled being asked ""Have you thought of a story?"" each morning, and every time being ""forced to reply with a mortifying negative.""[23]During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. ""Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated,"" Mary noted, ""galvanismhad given token of such things"".[24]It was after midnight before they retired and, unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the ""grim terrors"" of her ""waking dream"".[6]

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa in the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her ""waking dream"" took place between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.[26]

Mary Shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a fully-fledged novel.[27]She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment ""when I first stepped out from childhood into life.""[28]Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[29]This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composingFrankensteinin 1816, she was probably nursing her second child, who was also dead by the time ofFrankenstein's publication.[30]Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre ofBathin 1816.[31]

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on thevampirelegends he heard while travelling theBalkans, and from thisJohn PolidoricreatedThe Vampyre(1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.[32][33][34]

The group talked aboutEnlightenmentandCounter-Enlightenmentideas as well. Mary Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society.[35]

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as thefair copyfor her publisher, are now housed in theBodleian LibraryinOxford.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300,Ulysses,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel),"At 8 a.m.,Malachi ""Buck"" Mulligan, a boisterous medical student, calls aspiring writerStephen Dedalusup to the roof of theSandycove Martello tower, where they live. There is tension between Dedalus and Mulligan stemming from a cruel remark Dedalus overheard Mulligan make about his recently deceased mother and from the fact that Mulligan has invited an English student,Haines, to stay with them. The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore, where Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan. The three make plans to meet at a pub, The Ship, at 12:30pm. Departing, Stephen decides that he will not return to the tower that night, as Mulligan, the ""usurper"", has taken it over.

Stephen is teaching a history class on the victories ofPyrrhus of Epirus. After class, one student,Cyril Sargent, stays behind so that Stephen can show him how to do a set of algebraic exercises. Stephen looks at Sargent's ugly face and tries to imagine Sargent's mother's love for him. He then visitsunionistschool headmasterGarrett Deasy, from whom he collects his pay. Deasy asks Stephen to take his long-winded letter aboutfoot-and-mouth diseaseto a newspaper office for printing. The two discuss Irish history and Deasy lectures on what he believes is the role of Jews in the economy. As Stephen leaves, Deasy jokes that Ireland has ""never persecuted the Jews"" because the country ""never let them in"". This episode is the source of some of the novel's best-known lines, such as Dedalus's claim that ""history is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake"" and that God is ""a shout in the street"".

Stephen walks alongSandymount Strandfor some time, mulling various philosophical concepts, his family, his life as a student in Paris, and his mother's death. As he reminisces he lies down among some rocks, watches a couple whose dog urinates behind a rock, scribbles some ideas for poetry and picks his nose. This chapter is characterised by astream of consciousnessnarrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode, which have earned it a reputation for being one of the book's most difficult chapters.

The narrative shifts abruptly. The time is again 8 a.m., but the action has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book, Leopold Bloom, a part-Jewish advertising canvasser. The episode opens with the line ""Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls."" After starting to prepare breakfast, Bloom decides to walk to a butcher to buy a mutton kidney. Returning home, he prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wifeMollyas she lounges in bed. One of the letters is from her concert managerBlazes Boylan, with whom she is having an affair. Bloom reads a letter from their daughterMilly Bloom, who tells him about her progress in the photography business in Mullingar. The episode closes with Bloom reading a magazine story titled ""Matcham's Masterstroke"", by Mr. Philip Beaufoy, while defecating in the outhouse.

While making his way toWestland Rowpost office Bloom is tormented by the knowledge that Molly will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day. At the post office he surreptitiously collects a love letter from one 'Martha Clifford' addressed to his pseudonym, 'Henry Flower'. He meets an acquaintance, and while they chat, Bloom attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings, but is prevented by a passing tram. Next, he reads the letter from Martha Clifford and tears up the envelope in an alley. He wanders into a Catholic church during a service and muses on theology. The priest has the lettersI.N.R.I.orI.H.S.on his back; Molly had told Bloom that they meantI have sinnedorI have suffered, andIron nails ran in. He buys a bar of lemon soap from a chemist. He then meets another acquaintance,Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly takes him to be offering a racing tip for the horseThrowaway. Finally, Bloom heads towards thebaths.

The episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three others, including Stephen's father. They drive toPaddy Dignam's funeral, making small talk on the way. The carriage passes both Stephen and Blazes Boylan. There is discussion of various forms of death and burial. Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead infant son, Rudy, and the suicide of his own father. They enter the chapel for the service and subsequently leave with the coffin cart. Bloom sees a mysterious man wearing amackintoshduring the burial. Bloom continues to reflect upon death, but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace ""warm fullblooded life"".

At the office of theFreeman's Journal, Bloom attempts to place an ad. Although initially encouraged by the editor, he is unsuccessful. Stephen arrives bringing Deasy's letter about foot-and-mouth disease, but Stephen and Bloom do not meet. Stephen leads the editor and others to a pub, relating an anecdote on the way about ""two Dublin vestals"". The episode is broken into short segments by newspaper-style headlines, and is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.

Bloom's thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime approaches. He meets an old flame, hears news of Mina Purefoy's labour, and helps a blind boy cross the street. He enters the restaurant of the Burton Hotel, where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like animals. He goes instead toDavy Byrne's pub, where he consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy, and muses upon the early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has declined: ""Me. And me now."" Bloom's thoughts touch on what goddesses and gods eat and drink. He ponders whether the statues of Greek goddesses in theNational Museumhave anuses as do mortals. On leaving the pub Bloom heads toward the museum, but spots Boylan across the street and, panicking, rushes into the gallery across the street from the museum.

At theNational Library, Stephen explains to some scholars his biographical theory of the works of Shakespeare, especiallyHamlet, which he argues are based largely on the posited adultery ofShakespeare's wife. Buck Mulligan arrives and interrupts to read out the telegram that Stephen had sent him indicating that he would not make their planned rendezvous at The Ship. Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old copy of the ad he has been trying to place. He passes in between Stephen and Mulligan as they exit the library at the end of the episode.

In this episode, nineteen short vignettes depict the movements of various characters, major and minor, through the streets of Dublin. The episode begins by followingFather Conmee, a Jesuit priest, on his trip north, and ends with an account of the cavalcade of theLord Lieutenant of Ireland,William Ward, Earl of Dudley, through the streets, which is encountered by several characters from the novel.

In this episode, dominated by motifs of music, Bloom has dinner with Stephen's uncle at the Ormond hotel, while Molly's lover, Blazes Boylan, proceeds to his rendezvous with her. While dining, Bloom listens to the singing of Stephen's father and others, watches the seductive barmaids, and composes a reply to Martha Clifford's letter.

This episode is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin who works as a debt collector. The narrator goes toBarney Kiernan's pub where he meets a character referred to only as ""The Citizen"". This character is believed to be a satirisation ofMichael Cusack, a founder member of theGaelic Athletic Association.[49]When Leopold Bloom enters the pub, he is berated by the Citizen, who is a fierceFenianand anti-Semite. The episode ends with Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Savior was a Jew. As Bloom leaves the pub, the Citizen throws a biscuit tin at Bloom's head, but misses. The episode is marked by extended tangents made in voices other than that of the unnamed narrator; these include streams of legal jargon, a report of a boxing match, Biblical passages, and elements of Irish mythology.

All the action of the episode takes place on the rocks of Sandymount Strand, the shoreline that Stephen visited in Episode 3. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, is seated on the rocks with her two friends, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman. The girls are taking care of three children, a baby, and four-year-old twins named Tommy and Jacky. Gerty contemplates love, marriage and femininity as night falls. The reader is gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance. Gerty teases the onlooker by exposing her legs and underwear, and Bloom, in turn, masturbates. Bloom's masturbatory climax is echoed by the fireworks at the nearby bazaar. As Gerty leaves, Bloom realises that she has a lame leg, and believes this is the reason she has been ""left on the shelf"". After several mental digressions he decides to visit Mina Purefoy at the maternity hospital. It is uncertain how much of the episode is Gerty's thoughts, and how much is Bloom's sexual fantasy. Some believe that the episode is divided into two halves: the first half the highly romanticized viewpoint of Gerty, and the other half that of the older and more realistic Bloom.[50]Joyce himself said, however, that ""nothing happened between [Gerty and Bloom]. It all took place in Bloom's imagination"".[50]Nausicaaattracted immense notoriety while the book was being published in serial form. It has also attracted great attention from scholars of disability in literature.[51]The style of the first half of the episode borrows from (and parodies) romance magazines and novelettes. Bloom's contemplation of Gerty parodies Dedalus's vision of the wading girl at the seashore inA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.[52][53]

Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth, and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan. As the only father in the group of men, Bloom is concerned about Mina Purefoy in her labour. He starts thinking about his wife and the births of his two children. He also thinks about the loss of his only 'heir', Rudy. The young men become boisterous, and start discussing such topics as fertility, contraception and abortion. There is also a suggestion that Milly, Bloom's daughter, is in a relationship with one of the young men, Bannon. They continue on to a pub to continue drinking, following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy. This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which, among other things, recapitulates the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose,Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others,Malory, theKing James Bible,Bunyan,Pepys,Defoe,Sterne,Walpole,Gibbon,Dickens, andCarlyle, before concluding in a Joycean version of contemporary slang. The development of the English language in the episode is believed to be aligned with the nine-month gestation period of the foetus in the womb.[54]

Episode 15 is written as a play script, complete with stage directions. The plot is frequently interrupted by ""hallucinations"" experienced by Stephen and Bloom—fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters. Stephen and his friend Lynch walk intoNighttown, Dublin'sred-light district. Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them atBella Cohen's brothel where, in the company of her workers includingZoe Higgins,Florry TalbotandKitty Ricketts, he has a series of hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes, fantasies and transgressions. In one of these hallucinations, Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety of sadistic, accusing women includingMrs Yelverton Barry,Mrs Bellinghamand the HonMrs Mervyn Talboys. In another of Bloom's hallucinations, he is crowned king of his own city, which is called Bloomusalem—Bloom imagines himself being loved and admired by Bloomusalem's citizens, but then imagines himself being accused of various charges. As a result, he is burnt at the stake and several citizens pay their respects to him as he dies.

Then the hallucination ends, Bloom finds himself next to Zoe, and the two talk. After they talk, Bloom continues to encounter other miscellaneous hallucinations, including one in which he converses with his grandfather Lipoti Virag, who lectures him about sex, among other things. At the end of the hallucination, Bloom is speaking with some prostitutes when he hears a sound coming from downstairs. He hears heels clacking on the staircase, and he observes what appears to be a male form passing down the staircase. He speaks with Zoe and Kitty for a moment, and then sees Bella Cohen come into the brothel. He observes her appearance and talks with her for a little while. But this conversation subsequently begins another hallucination, in which Bloom imagines Bella to be a man named Mr. Bello and Bloom imagines himself to be a woman. In this fantasy, Bloom imagines himself (or ""herself"", in the hallucination) being dominated by Bello, who both sexually and verbally humiliates Bloom. Bloom also interacts with other imaginary characters in this scene before the hallucination ends.

After the hallucination ends, Bloom sees Stephen overpay at the brothel, and decides to hold onto the rest of Stephen's money for safekeeping. Stephen hallucinates that his mother's rotting cadaver has risen up from the floor to confront him. He criesNon serviam!, uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier, and flees the room. Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after Stephen. He finds Stephen engaged in an argument with an English soldier,Private Carr, who, after hearing Stephen utter a perceived insult to KingEdward VII, punches him. The police arrive and the crowd disperses. As Bloom tends to Stephen, he has a hallucination of his deceased son, Rudy, as an 11-year-old.

Bloom takes Stephen to a cabman's shelter nearButt Bridgeto restore him to his senses. There, they encounter a drunken sailor, D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom, Stephen and Murphy's identities being repeatedly called into question. The narrative's rambling and laboured style in this episode reflects the protagonists' nervous exhaustion and confusion.

Bloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup ofcocoa, discusses cultural and linguistic differences between them, considers the possibility of publishing Stephen's parable stories, and offers him a place to stay for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom's offer and is ambiguous in response to Bloom's proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night,[55]and Bloom goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. She awakens and questions him about his day. The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised and ""mathematical""catechismof 309 questions and answers, and was reportedly Joyce's favourite episode in the novel. The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination and include a list of 25 men that purports to be the ""preceding series"" of Molly's suitors and Bloom's reflections on them. While describing events apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or scientific terms, the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator, many or most of which are intentional by Joyce.[56]

The final episode consists of Molly Bloom's thoughts as she lies in bed next to her husband. The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness technique in eight paragraphs and lacks punctuation. Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including LieutenantStanley G. Gardner, the events of the day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her curtailed singing career. She also hints at a lesbian relationship in her youth, with a childhood friend, Hester Stanhope. These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or the need to urinate. Molly is surprised by the early arrival of her menstrual period, which she ascribes to her vigorous sex with Boylan. The episode concludes with Molly's remembrance of Bloom's marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: ""he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes."""
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45,Anne of Green Gables,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables,"Anne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke,Nova Scotia(based upon the real community ofNew London, Prince Edward Island),[16][17]is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally sought to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm atGreen Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based onCavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.

Anne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelled with an ""e"" at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles, and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay.

Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables.

The book recounts Anne's struggles and joys in settling into Green Gables (the first real home she's ever known): the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or ""bosom friend"" as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmateGilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes several times. As time passes, however, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but her pride and stubbornness keep her from speaking to him.

The book also follows Anne's adventures in Avonlea. Episodes include playtime with her friends Diana, calm, placid Jane Andrews, and beautiful, boy-crazy Ruby Gillis. She has run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters, Gertie and Josie, and frequent domestic ""scrapes"" such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thinks is raspberry cordial but which turns out to be currant wine.

At sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana, much to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship awarded to the top student in English. This scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the realDalhousie College) on the mainland in Nova Scotia.

Near the end of the book, however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School in favor of Anne, to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next.

Anne of Green Gableswas first published byL.C. Page & Co.ofBostonon June 13, 1908.[18]The book quickly became a best-seller, selling over 19,000 copies in the first five months. Since then, over 50 million copies have been sold worldwide.[19]A full scan of the first edition, first impression is provided by the L. M. Montgomery Institute.

Montgomery's original manuscript is preserved by theConfederation Centre of the Arts, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since 2022, the Centre has hosted a project in which digital images of the entire manuscript can be examined online. A transcript of the manuscript was published by Nimbus Publishing in 2019.

Montgomery's original typescript and the corrected proofs are lost.[20]

The first edition has errors in the text. Critical editions will identify corrections that have been applied to the text by the editor. The choice of corrections depends on the editor and varies across editions. As an example, thePenguin Classicsedition,[21]edited by Benjamin Lefebvre, lists the following corrections:

Based on the popularity of her first book, Montgomery wrote a series of sequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley.

The prequel,Before Green Gables(2008), was written byBudge Wilsonwith the authorization of the heirs of L. M. Montgomery.

TheGreen Gablesfarmhouse is located inCavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions onPrince Edward Islandhave been developed based on the fictional Anne, and provincial license plates once bore her image.[22]Balsam Hollow, the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods and Campbell Pond, the body of water which inspired The Lake of Shining Waters, both described in the book, are located in the vicinity.[23]In addition, theConfederation Centre of the Artshas featured the wildly successfulAnne of Green Gables musicalon its mainstage every summer for over five decades, until 2020 and the Covid pandemic.[24]The Anne of Green Gables Museum is located in Park Corner, PEI, in a home that inspired L. M. Montgomery.[25]

The province and tourist facilities have highlighted the local connections to the internationally popular novels.Anne of Green Gableshas been translated into 36 languages.[26][27]""Tourism byAnnefans is an important part of the Island economy"".[28]Merchants offer items based on the novels.

In 2019, Canadian publishing company Bradan Press crowdfunded aScottish-Gaelictranslation ofAnne of Green Gables, titled Anna Ruadh, through the crowdfunding websiteKickstarter. The book, released in 2020, is the first Scottish-Gaelic translation ofAnne of Green Gables.[29][30]

The novel has been popular in Japan, where it is known asRed-haired Anne(赤毛のアン(Akage no An)),[31][32]and where it has been included in the national school curriculum since 1952. 'Anne' is revered as ""an icon"" in Japan, especially since 1979 when this story was broadcast asanime,Anne of Green Gables. Japanese couples travel to Prince Edward Island to have civil wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm. Some Japanese girls arrive as tourists with red-dyed hair styled in pigtails, to look like Anne.[33]In 2014, theAsadora'Hanako to Anne', which was aboutHanako Muraoka, the first person to translate Anne into Japanese, was broadcast and Anne became popular among old and young alike.

A replica of the Green Gables house in Cavendish is located in the theme park Canadian World inAshibetsu, Hokkaido, Japan. The park was a less expensive alternative for Japanese tourists instead of traveling to P.E.I. The park hosted performances featuring actresses playing Anne and Diana. The theme park is open during the summer season with free admission, though there are no longer staff or interpreters.[34]

The Avonlea theme park near Cavendish and the Cavendish Figurines shop have trappings so that tourists may dress like the book's characters for photos.[35]Souvenir shops throughout Prince Edward Island offer numerous foods and products based on details of the 'Anne Shirley' novels. Straw hats for girls with sewn-in red braids are common, as are bottles of raspberry cordial soda.[36]

The first filmed appearance of Anne Shirley was in the 1919 silent film,Anne of Green Gables, in which the role was played byMary Miles Minter. The film was directed byWilliam Desmond Taylor. As of 2011, no prints of this silent film adaptation are known to survive. The 1919 film version moved the story from Prince Edward Island to New England, which one American critic—unaware that the novel was set in Canada—praised for ""the genuine New England atmosphere called for by the story"".[46]Montgomery herself was infuriated with the film for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary:

Montgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she had portrayed ""a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne"", and complained about a scene where Shirley waved about a shotgun as something as her Anne would never do.[47]

In the1934 adaptationof the novel, Anne was portrayed byDawn O'Day, who legally changed her name to ""Anne Shirley."" She reprised the role inAnne of Windy Poplars, a 1940 film adaptation. Montgomery liked the 1934 film more than the 1919 film, not least because now the book's dialogue could be portrayed on the silver screen and that two scenes were filmed on location in Prince Edward Island (though the rest of the film was shot in California), but still charged that neither the 1919 nor 1934 versions ofAnne of Green Gablesquite got her book right.[48]Writing about the 1934 version ofAnne of Green Gables, Montgomery wrote in her diary that it was a ""thousand times"" better than the 1919 version, but still it: ""was so entirely different frommyvision of the scenes and the people that it did not seem likemybook at all"".[47]The British scholarFaye Hammillwrote that 1934 film version stripped Anne of the ""Canadian and feminist"" aspects that the Anne of the books possessed, stating that there was something about Anne that Hollywood cannot get right.[48]Hammill observed that the idea that Anne was entirely cheerful is a product of the film and television versions as the Anne of the books has to deal with loss, rejection, cruel authority figures, and loneliness.[48]

As one of the most familiar characters in Canadian literature,Anne of Green Gableshas been parodied by several Canadian comedy troupes, includingCODCO(Anne of Green Gut) andThe Frantics(Fran of theFundy)."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2000,Don Quijote (Spanish),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote,"For Cervantes and the readers of his day,Don Quixotewas a one-volume book published in 1605, divided internally into four parts, not the first part of a two-part set. The mention in the 1605 book of further adventures yet to be told was totally conventional, did not indicate any authorial plans for a continuation, and was not taken seriously by the book's first readers.[14]

Cervantes, in ametafictionalnarrative, writes that the first few chapters were taken from ""the archives of La Mancha"", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by theMoorishhistorianCide Hamete Benengeli.

Alonso Quixanois ahidalgonearing 50 years of age who lives in a deliberately unspecified region ofLa Manchawith his niece and housekeeper. While he lives a frugal life, he is full of fantasies about chivalry stemming from his obsession with chivalric romance books. Eventually, his obsession becomes madness when he decides to become aknight errant, donning an old suit of armor. He renames himself ""Don Quixote"", names his old workhorse ""Rocinante"", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo (a slaughterhouse worker with a famed hand for salting pork) hislady love, renaming herDulcinea del Toboso.

As he travels in search of adventure, he arrives at an inn that he believes to be a castle, calls the prostitutes he meets there ""ladies"", and demands that the innkeeper, whom he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. The innkeeper agrees. Quixote starts the night holdingvigilat the inn's horse trough, which Quixote imagines to be a chapel. He then becomes involved in a fight withmuleteerswho try to remove his armor from the horse trough to water their mules. In a pretend ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.

Quixote next encounters a servant named Andres who is tied to a tree and being beaten by his master over disputed wages. Quixote orders the master to stop the beating, untie Andres and swear to treat his servant fairly. However, the beating is resumed, and redoubled, as soon as Quixote leaves.

Quixote then chances upon traders fromToledo. He demands that they agree that Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world. One of them demands to see her picture so that he can decide for himself. Enraged, Quixote charges at them but his horse stumbles, causing him to fall. One of the traders beats up Quixote, who is left at the side of the road until a neighboring peasant brings him back home.

While Quixote lies unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parishcurate, and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books, seeing them as the root of his madness. They seal up the library room, later telling Quixote that it was done by a wizard.

Don Quixote asks his neighbour, the poor farm labourerSancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship. Sancho agrees and they sneak away at dawn. Their adventures together begin with Quixote's attack on some windmills which he believes to be ferocious giants. They next encounter two Benedictinefriarsand, nearby, an unrelated lady in a carriage. Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who are holding the lady captive, knocks one of them from his horse, and is challenged by an armedBasquetravelling with the company. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and begging him not to harm the Basque.

After a friendly encounter with some goatherds and a less friendly one with someYanguesanporters drivingGalician ponies, Quixote and Sancho enter an inn owned by Juan Palomeque, where a mix-up involving a servant girl's romantic rendezvous with another guest results in a brawl. Quixote explains to Sancho that the inn is enchanted. They decide to leave, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed in the air by several mischievous guests at the inn before he manages to follow.

After further adventures involving a dead body, a barber's basin that Quixote imagines as the legendary helmet ofMambrino, and a group ofgalley slaves, they wander into theSierra Morena. There they encounter the dejected and mostly mad Cardenio, who relateshis story. Inspired by Cardenio, Quixote decides to imitate what he has read in his chivalric romances and live like a hermit in a display of devotion to Dulcinea. He sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village. They make a plan to trick Quixote into coming home, recruiting Dorotea, a woman they discover in the forest, to pose as the Princess Micomicona, a damsel in distress.

The plan works and Quixote and the group return to the inn, though Quixote is now convinced, thanks to a lie told by Sancho when asked about the letter, that Dulcinea wants to see him. At the inn, several other plots intersect and are resolved. Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Quixote does battle with somewineskinswhich he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomicona's kingdom. An officer of theSanta Hermandadarrives with a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves, but the priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees and Quixote is locked in a cage which he is made to think is an enchantment. He has a learned conversation with a Toledocanonhe encounters by chance on the road, in which the canon expresses his scorn for untruthful chivalric books, but Don Quixote defends them. The group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, before he is finally brought home.

The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.

Although the two parts are now published as a single work,Don Quixote, Part Twowas a sequel published ten years after the original novel. In an early example ofmetafiction, Part Two indicates that several of its characters have read the first part of the novel and are thus familiar with the history and peculiarities of the two protagonists.

Don Quixote and Sancho are on their way to El Toboso to meet Dulcinea, with Sancho aware that his story about Dulcinea was a complete fabrication. They reach the city at daybreak and decide to enter at nightfall. However, a bad omen frightens Quixote into retreat and they quickly leave. Sancho is instead sent out alone by Quixote to meet Dulcinea and act as a go-between. Sancho's luck brings three peasant girls along the road and he quickly tells Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting and as beautiful as ever. Since Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho goes on to pretend that an enchantment of some sort is at work.

A duke and duchess encounter the duo. These nobles have read Part One of the story and are themselves very fond of books of chivalry. They decide to play along for their own amusement, beginning a string of imagined adventures and practical jokes. As part of one prank, Quixote and Sancho are led to believe that the only way to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets his promised governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler before all ends in humiliation. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.

Quixote battles the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Quixote's hometown who had earlier posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach inBarcelona. Defeated, Quixote submits to prearranged chivalric terms: the vanquished must obey the will of the conqueror. He is ordered to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for a period of one year, by which time his friends and relatives hope he will be cured.

On the way back home, Quixote and Sancho ""resolve"" the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Upon returning to his village, Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully become Alonso Quixano once more. Sancho tries to restore his faith and his interest in Dulcinea, but Quixano only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry.

After Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.

Don Quixote, Part Onecontains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of thepicaresquefigures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is ""El Curioso Impertinente"" (The Ill-Advised Curiosity), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of aFlorentinenobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity and talks his close friendLothariointo attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.

InPart Two, the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions inPart Oneand promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, ""Part Two"" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.

Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.[15]

Thestory within a storyrelates that, for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates; an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.

One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: When Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.

Later, the maid's lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen, and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife's affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish. Lothario is killed in battle soon afterward and Camilla dies of grief.

The novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming inDon Quixotemakes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the namesRocinante[16](a reversal) andDulcinea(an allusion to illusion), and the wordquixoteitself, possibly a pun onquijada(jaw) but certainly[17][18]cuixot(Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse'srump.[19]

As a military term, the wordquijoterefers tocuisses, part of a full suit ofplate armourprotecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix-otedenotes the augmentative—for example,grandemeans large, butgrandotemeans extra large, with grotesque connotations. Following this example,Quixotewould suggest 'The Great Quijano', an oxymoronic play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.[20]

Cervantes wrote his work inEarly Modern Spanish, heavily borrowing fromOld Spanish, the medieval form of the language. The language ofDon Quixote, although still containingarchaisms, is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of thePoema de mio Cid, a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language asMiddle Englishis fromModern English. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.

InDon Quixote, there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource—he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that drove him to madness; and many times when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote useKing James Bibleor Shakespearean English, or evenMiddle English.)[21][22]

In Old Castilian, the letterxrepresented the sound writtenshin modern English, so the name was originally pronounced[kiˈʃote]. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, asound changecaused it to be pronounced with avoiceless velar fricative[x]sound (like theScotsorGermanch), and today the Spanish pronunciation of ""Quixote"" is[kiˈxote]. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such asAsturian,Leonese,Galician,Catalan,Italian,Portuguese,TurkishandFrench, where it is pronounced with a ""sh"" or ""ch"" sound; the French operaDon Quichotteis one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.

Today, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation ofQuixote(Quijote), as/kiːˈhoʊti/,[1]although the traditional Englishspelling-based pronunciationwith the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in/ˈkwɪksət/or/ˈkwɪksoʊt/. InAustralian English, the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was/ˈkwɪksət/until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to ""anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly"".[23]The traditional English rendering is preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival formquixotic, i.e.,/kwɪkˈsɒtɪk/,[24][25]defined byMerriam-Websteras the foolishly impractical pursuit of ideals, typically marked by rash and lofty romanticism.[26]

Harold BloomsaysDon Quixoteis the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war withFreud'sreality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying. Bloom says that the novel has an endless range of meanings, but that a recurring theme is the human need to withstand suffering.[27]

Edith Grossman, who wrote and published a highly acclaimed[28]English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:

The novel's structure isepisodicin form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, asingenioso(Spanish) means ""quick with inventiveness"",[30]marking the transition of modern literature fromdramaticto thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.

Althoughburlesqueon the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works byPablo PicassoandRichard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat diddy, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.

Even faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire oforthodoxy, veracity and even nationalism.[citation needed]In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped lead literary practice beyond the narrow convention of thechivalric romance. Hespoofsthe chivalric romance[31]through a straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to theknightly virtuesof the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the wordquixoticwas quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed,Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase ""tilting at windmills"" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.

It stands in a unique position between medievalromanceand the modern novel. The former consists of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through ""having read his adventures"", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more ""Alonso Quixano the Good"".

The cave ofMedrano[32](also known as thecasa de Medrano) inArgamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Miguel de Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write his famous work ""Don Quixote de la Mancha.""[33][34][35][36][37][38][39]

Sources forDon Quixoteinclude the Castilian novelAmadis de Gaula, which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, isTirant lo Blanch, which the priest describes in Chapter VI ofQuixoteas ""the best book in the world."" (However, the sense in which it was ""best"" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called ""the most difficult passage ofDon Quixote"".) The scene of the book burning provides a list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.

Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poemOrlando furioso. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet ofMambrino, an episode from Canto I ofOrlando, and itself a reference toMatteo Maria Boiardo'sOrlando innamorato.[40]The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 ofOrlando, regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.[41]

Another important source appears to have been Apuleius'sThe Golden Ass, one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale ""The Curious Impertinent"" in chapter 35 of the first part ofDon Quixoteis a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.[42]Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.

Cervantes' experiences as agalley slavein Algiers also influencedQuixote.[43]

Medical theories may have also influenced Cervantes' literary process. Cervantes had familial ties to the distinguished medical community. His father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, and his great-grandfather, Juan Díaz de Torreblanca, were surgeons. Additionally, his sister, Andrea de Cervantes, was a nurse.[44]He also befriended many individuals involved in the medical field, in that he knew medical author Francisco Díaz, an expert in urology, and royal doctorAntonio Ponce de Santa Cruzwho served as a personal doctor to both Philip III and Philip IV of Spain.[45]

Apart from the personal relations Cervantes maintained within the medical field, Cervantes' personal life was defined by an interest in medicine. He frequently visited patients from the Hospital de Inocentes in Sevilla.[44]Furthermore, Cervantes explored medicine in his personal library. His library contained more than 200 volumes and included books likeExamen de Ingenios, byJuan HuarteandPractica y teórica de cirugía, by Dionisio Daza Chacón that defined medical literature and medical theories of his time.[45]

Researchers Isabel Sanchez Duque and Francisco Javier Escudero have found that Cervantes was a friend of the family Villaseñor, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acuña. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road fromEl TobosotoMiguel Estebanin 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of ""hidalgo"", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.[46][47]

It is not certain when Cervantes began writingPart TwoofDon Quixote, but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. In about September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitledSecond Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate)Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, ofTordesillas, was published inTarragonaby an unidentifiedAragonesewho was an admirer ofLope de Vega, rival of Cervantes.[48]It was translated intoEnglishby William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.

Some modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda's book in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that Cervantes encountered it, which may have been much earlier.

Avellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes'sSegunda Partelend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.

In his introduction toThe Portable Cervantes,Samuel Putnam, a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version ""one of the most disgraceful performances in history"".[49]

The second part of Cervantes'Don Quixote, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics[50]as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes'sSegunda Parte, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda'sSecond Partbeing printed there, in an early example ofmetafiction.[51]Don Quixote and Sancho Panza also meet one of the characters from Avellaneda's book, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and make him swear that the ""other"" Quixote and Sancho are impostors.[52]

Cervantes' story takes place on the plains ofLa Mancha, specifically thecomarcaofCampo de Montiel.

The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence ofDon Quixotehas been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184,The Count of Monte Cristo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo,"On the day in 1815 whenNapoleonescapes fromElba, Edmond Dantès sails thePharaonintoMarseilleafter the death of the captain, Leclère. The ship's owner, Morrel, will make Dantès the next captain. On his deathbed, Leclère charged Dantès to deliver a package toGeneral Bertrand(exiled withNapoleon), and a letter from Elba to a Bonapartist in Paris named Noirtier.

Crewmate Danglars is jealous of Dantès's rapid promotion. On the eve of Dantès's wedding to hisCatalanfiancée Mercédès, Danglars meets Fernand Mondego, Mercédès's cousin and a rival for her affections, and Mondego and Danglars hatch a plot to anonymously accuse him of being aBonapartist. Dantès's neighbor, Caderousse, is present; he too is jealous of Dantès, but although he objects to the plot, he becomes too drunk to prevent it.

On his wedding day, Dantès is arrested, but the cowardly Caderousse stays silent. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, is Noirtier's son. Knowing his political career would be destroyed if it is known that his father is a Bonapartist, he destroys the letter and silences Dantès by sentencing him without trial to life imprisonment.

After six years of solitary imprisonment in theChâteau d'If, Dantès is on the verge of suicide when another prisoner, the Abbé Faria, an Italian scholarly priest, digs an escape tunnel that mistakenly ends in Dantès's cell. The Abbé helps Dantès deduce the culprits of his imprisonment. Over the next eight years, Faria educates Dantès in languages, history, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death fromcatalepsyand having grown fond of his pupil, Faria tells Dantès the location of a vast treasure hidden on the island ofMonte Cristo.

On 28 February 1829, Faria dies. Dantès takes Faria's body to his cell and places himself in the burial sack. When he is thrown into the sea, Dantès cuts through the sack and swims to a nearby island, where, claiming to be a shipwrecked sailor, he is rescued byGenoesesmugglers. Some months later, he locates and retrieves the treasure; he later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title ofcountfrom theTuscangovernment.

Having sworn vengeance on Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort, Dantès returns to Marseille in search of information for his vengeance. Traveling as the Abbé Busoni, Dantès finds Caderousse, who regrets not intervening in Dantès's arrest. Caderousse informs him that Mercédès eventually resigned herself to marrying Fernand, that Dantès's father died of starvation, and that his old employer Morrel tried in vain to secure Dantès's release and tend after his father in his absence, but is now on the brink of bankruptcy. Both Danglars and Fernand have prospered greatly. Danglars became a speculator, amassed a fortune, married a wealthy widow, and became a baron. Fernand served in the French Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dantès rewards Caderousse with a diamond. Later, Caderousse negotiates the sale of the diamond to a jeweler, but kills the jeweler to keep the diamond and the money; he is eventually arrested andsentenced to the galleys.

To rescue Morrel from bankruptcy, Dantès poses as a banker, buys Morrel's debts, and gives him three months' reprieve. At the end of the three months, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that the debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dantès.

Dantès reappears nine years later, in 1838, as the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. Fernand is now the Count de Morcerf, Danglars a baron and banker, and Villefort aprocureur du roi('royal prosecutor').

In Rome, atCarnivaltime, Dantès befriendsViscountAlbert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Fernand. He arranges for Albert to be captured by thebanditLuigi Vampa, and ""rescues"" the boy, earning his trust. Albert introduces the Count to Parisianhigh society. Dantès, in his guise as the Count, meets Mercédès for the first time in 23 years, and eventually makes the acquaintance of Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

The Count purchases a home inAuteuil, a suburb of Paris. He has learned from his servant Bertuccio that it is the home in which Villefort once had an extramarital affair with Danglars's wife, who gave birth to a child that Villefort buried alive in order to cover up the affair. The infant was rescued by Bertuccio, named Benedetto, and raised by Bertuccio's sister Assunta, but Benedetto turned to a life of crime as a young man, murdered Assunta, and was sentenced to the galleys.

Having impressed Parisian society with his wealth and air of mystery, the Count begins setting up the pieces for his revenge. He persuades Danglars to extend him a credit of six million francs. He discusses the properties of various poisons with Villefort's second wife Heloïse, and allows her to borrow some of his supply. He allows his ward, Haydée—the exiled daughter ofAli Pasha of Janina, whom Dantès purchased from slavery—to see Fernand, recognizing him as the man who betrayed and murdered her father and stole his fortune. Having freed Benedetto and Caderousse from the galleys (under the alias ""Lord Wilmore""), he anonymously hires Benedetto to impersonate an Italian nobleman, ""Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti"", and introduces him to Parisian society. He manipulates the financial markets by bribing atelegraphoperator to transmit a false message, causing Danglars to lose hundreds of thousands of francs.

Meanwhile, Villefort's daughter Valentine is engaged to marry Albert's friend Franz, but is secretly in love with Morrel's son Maximilien; Noirtier, her grandfather, induces Franz to break the engagement by revealing that Noirtier himself killed Franz's father in a duel. Benedetto ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eugénie to him after canceling her engagement to Albert. Caderousse blackmails Benedetto, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. Heloïse begins poisoning members of Villefort's family, intending to ensure that all of the family's wealth will be inherited by her son Édouard, rather than her stepdaughter Valentine; Noirtier secretly begins dosing Valentine with a drug that will give her limited resistance to the poison.

Caderousse attempts to rob the Count's house but is caught by ""Abbé Busoni"" and forced to write a letter to Danglars, exposing ""Cavalcanti"" as an impostor. When Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Benedetto. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement naming his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse before he dies.

The Count anonymously leaks to the newspapers Fernand's betrayal of Ali Pasha, and at theChamber of Peers' inquiry into the accusations Haydée testifies against him as an eyewitness. Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to aduel. The Count is later visited by Mercédès, who had recognized him as Dantès upon their first meeting but chose not to say anything. Mercédès begs Dantès to spare her son. He tells her of the injustices inflicted on him, but agrees not to kill Albert. Realizing that Dantès intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, who makes a public apology to the Count. Albert and Mercédès disown Fernand, renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives. Albert enlists as a soldier, while Mercédès lives alone in Dantès's old house in Marseilles. Fernand confronts the Count of Monte Cristo, who reveals his identity. Fernand shoots himself.

At the party to celebrate ""Cavalcanti""'s engagement to Eugénie Danglars, the police arrive to arrest Benedetto for Caderousse's murder. Benedetto flees, but is arrested and returned to Paris. Eugénie (who is implied to be a lesbian[2][3]) also takes the opportunity to flee Paris with her girlfriend.

Valentine barely survives Héloïse's first attempt to poison her, and Maximilien begs the Count to protect her from the unknown poisoner. He does so by faking her death, making it appear that the poisoner succeeded. Villefort, deducing that Héloïse is the murderer, gives her a choice between the shame of a public trial and committing suicide in private, before leaving to prosecute Benedetto's trial. At the trial, Benedetto reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive, having learned the truth from Bertuccio. Villefort admits his guilt and rushes home to prevent his wife's suicide but is too late; she is dead and has poisoned her son Édouard as well. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, which drives Villefort insane. Dantès tries but fails toresuscitateÉdouard, causing him to question if his revenge has gone too far.

As a result of the Count's financial manipulations, Danglars is left with a ruined reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfill their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. He flees to Italy with the Count's receipt for the cash and 50,000 francs of his own, and is reimbursed the 5,000,000 francs from the Count's own bank account. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa. The bandits extort Danglars' ill-gotten gains out of him by forcing him to pay exorbitant prices for food and water; Dantès anonymously returns the money to the hospitals. Danglars finally repents of his crimes, and a softened Dantès forgives him and allows him to depart with his 50,000 francs.

Maximilien Morrel is driven to despair by Valentine's apparent death and considers suicide. Dantès reveals his true identity and persuades Maximilien to delay his suicide for one month. One month later, on the island of Monte Cristo, he reunites Valentine with Maximilien and reveals the true sequence of events. Having found peace, Dantès leaves the couple part of his fortune on the island and departs forthe Eastto begin a new life with Haydée, who has declared her love for him. The reader is left with a final line: ""l'humaine sagesse était tout entière dans ces deux mots: attendre et espérer!"" (""all human wisdom is contained in these two words: 'Wait and Hope'"").

A short novel titledGeorgesby Dumas was published in 1843, beforeThe Count of Monte Cristowas written. This novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas andplot devicesinThe Count of Monte Cristo.[5]

Dumas wrote that the germ of the idea of revenge as one theme in his novelThe Count of Monte Cristocame from an anecdote (Le Diamant et la Vengeance[6]) published in a memoir of incidents in France in 1838, written by an archivist of the Paris police.[7][8]The archivist wasJacques Peuchet, and the multi-volume book was calledMemoirs from the Archives of the Paris Policein English.[9]Dumas included this essay in one of the editions of his novel published in 1846.[10]

Peuchet related the tale of a shoemaker,Pierre Picaud, living inNîmesin 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy on behalf of England in a period of wars between France and England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in theFenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which the words ""Number One"" were printed, and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fiancée while Picaud was under arrest.[6]

In another of the true stories reported by Ashton-Wolfe, Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family.[10]This story is also mentioned in the Pléiade edition of this novel,[8]and it probably served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pléiade edition mentions other sources from real life:  a man namedAbbé Fariaexisted, was imprisoned but did not die in prison; he died in 1819 and left no large legacy to anyone.[8]As for Dantès, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet's book, since that model is murdered by the ""Caderousse"" of the plot.

The Count of Monte Cristowas originally published in theJournal des Débatsin eighteen parts. Serialization ran from 28 August 1844 to 15 January 1846. The first edition in book form was published in Paris byPétionin 18 volumes with the first two issued in 1844 and the remaining sixteen in 1845.[11]Most of the Belgian pirated editions, the first Paris edition and many others up to theLécrivain et Toubonillustrated edition of 1860 feature a misspelling of the title with ""Christo"" used instead of ""Cristo"". The first edition to feature the correct spelling was theL'Écho des Feuilletonsillustrated edition, Paris 1846. This edition featured plates byPaul GavarniandTony Johannotand was said to be ""revised"" and ""corrected"", although only the chapter structure appears to have been altered with an additional chapter entitledLa Maison des Allées de Meilhanhaving been created by splittingLe Départinto two.[12]

The first appearance ofThe Count of Monte Cristoin English was the first part of a serialization by W. Harrison Ainsworth in volume VII ofAinsworth's Magazinepublished in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitledThe Prisoner of If. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively.[12]Another abridged serialization appeared inThe London Journalbetween 1846 and 1847.

The first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitledThe Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo.[12]

In April 1846, volume three of theParlour Novelist, Belfast, Ireland: Simms and M'Intyre, London: W S Orr and Company, featured the first part of an unabridged translation of the novel by Emma Hardy. The remaining two parts would be issued as the Count of Monte Christo volumes I and II in volumes 8 and 9 of the Parlour Novelist respectively.[12]

The most common English translation is an anonymous one originally published in 1846 byChapman and Hall. This was originally released in ten weekly installments from March 1846 with six pages of letterpress and two illustrations by M Valentin.[13]The translation was released in book form with all twenty illustrations in two volumes in May 1846, a month after the release of the first part of the above-mentioned translation by Emma Hardy.[12]The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of ""Cristo"" and the extra chapterThe House on the Allées de Meilhan.

Most English editions of the novel follow the anonymous translation. In 1889, two of the major American publishersLittle BrownandT.Y. Crowellupdated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. This resulted in the removal of the chapterThe House on the Allées de Meilhan, with the text restored to the end of the chapter calledThe Departure.[14][15]

In 1955,Collinspublished an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitledThe Past, and renamed others.[16]This abridgment was republished by many Collins imprints and other publishers including theModern Library,Vintage, and the 1998Oxford World's Classicsedition (later editions restored the text). In 2008 Oxford released a revised edition with translation by David Coward. The 2009Everyman's Libraryedition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco.

In 1996,Penguin Classicspublished a new translation by Robin Buss. Buss' translation updated the language, making the text more accessible to modern readers, and restored content that was modified in the 1846 translation because of Victorian English social restrictions (for example, references to Eugénie's lesbian traits and behavior) to reflect Dumas' original version.

In addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese).[12]A more recent abridgment is the translation by Lowell Bair forBantam Classicsin 1956.

Many abridged translations omit the Count's enthusiasm forhashish. When serving a hashish jam to the young Frenchman Franz d'Épinay, the Count (calling himselfSinbad the Sailor), calls it, ""nothing less than the ambrosia whichHebeserved at the table of Jupiter"". When he arrives in Paris, the Count brandishes an emerald box in which he carries small green pills compounded of hashish and opium which he uses for sleeplessness. (Source: Chapters 31, 32, 38, 40, 53 & 77 in the 117-chapter unabridgedPocket Booksedition.) Dumas was a member of theClub des Hashischins.

In June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.[17]

The first Japanese translation byKuroiwa Shūrokuwas entitled ""Shigai Shiden Gankutsu-ou"" (史外史伝巌窟王, ""a historical story from outside history, the King of the Cavern""), and serialized from 1901 to 1902 in the Yorozu Chouhou newspaper, and released in book form in four volumes by publisher Aoki Suusandou in 1905. Though later translations use the title ""Monte Cristo-haku"" (モンテ・クリスト伯, the Count of Monte Cristo), the ""Gankutsu-ou"" title remains highly associated with the novel and is often used as an alternative. As of March 2016, all movie adaptations of the novel brought to Japan used the title ""Gankutsu-ou"", with the exception of the 2002 film, which has it as a subtitle (with the title itself simply being ""Monte Cristo"").

The novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novelsMeiji Gankutsu-ouby Taijirou Murasame andShin Gankutsu-oubyKaitarō Hasegawa. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the ""Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident"" (吉田岩窟王事件).

A manga adaptation of the novel, titledMonte Cristo Hakushaku(モンテ・クリスト, 伯爵) and made by Ena Moriyama, was published in November 2015.

The first translation into Chinese was published in 1907. The novel had been a personal favorite ofJiang Qing, and the 1978 translation became one of the first mass-popularized foreign novels in mainland China after end of theCultural Revolution. Since then, there have been another 22 Chinese translations.

The original work was published in serial form in theJournal des Débatsin 1844. Carlos Javier Villafane Mercado described the effect in Europe:

George Saintsburystated that ""Monte Cristois said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe. Perhaps no novel within a given number of years had so many readers and penetrated into so many different countries.""[19]This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was ""translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it ... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name 'Monte Cristo' into their titles.""[18]The titleMonte Cristolives on in a ""famous gold mine, a line of luxury Cuban cigars,a sandwich, and any number of bars and casinos—it even lurks in the name of the street-corner hustlethree-card monte.""[20]

Modern Russian writer and philologist Vadim Nikolayev determinedThe Count of Monte-Cristoas amegapolyphonicnovel.[21]

The novel has been the inspiration for many other books, fromLew Wallace'sBen-Hur(1880),[22]then to a science fiction retelling inAlfred Bester'sThe Stars My Destination,[23]and toStephen Fry'sThe Stars' Tennis Balls(entitledRevengein the U.S.).[24]

Fantasy novelistSteven Brust'sKhaavren Romancesseries have all used Dumas novels (particularly theThree Musketeersseries) as their chief inspiration, recasting the plots of those novels to fit within Brust's established world ofDragaera.[25]His 2020 novelThe Baron of Magister Valleyfollows suit, usingThe Count of Monte Cristoas a starting point.[26][27]Jin Yonghas admitted some influence from Dumas, his favorite non-Chinese novelist.[28]Some commentators feel that the plot ofA Deadly SecretresemblesThe Count of Monte Cristo, except that they are based in different countries and historical periods.

The success ofThe Count of Monte Cristocoincides with France'sSecond Empire. In the novel, Dumas tells of the 1815 return ofNapoleon I, and alludes to contemporary events when the governor at theChâteau d'Ifis promoted to a position at the castle of Ham.[8][Notes 1]The attitude of Dumas towards ""bonapartisme"" was conflicted. His father,Thomas-Alexandre Dumas,[Notes 2]a Haitian ofmixed descent, became a successful general during theFrench Revolution.  In 1840, the body of Napoleon Iwas brought to Franceand became an object of veneration in the church ofLes Invalides, renewing popular patriotic support for the Bonaparte family. As the story opens, the character Dantès is not aware of the politics, considers himself simply a good French citizen, and is caught between the conflicting loyalties of the royalist Villefort during the Restoration, and the father of Villefort, Noirtier, loyal to Napoleon, a firm bonapartist, and the bonapartist loyalty of his late captain, in a period of rapid changes of government in France.

In ""Causeries"" (1860), Dumas published a short paper, ""État civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo"", on the genesis of the Count ofMonte Cristo.[8][Notes 3]It appears that Dumas had close contacts with members of the Bonaparte family while living in Florence in 1841. In a small boat, he sailed around the island of Monte Cristo, accompanied by a young prince, a cousin to Louis Bonaparte, who was to become EmperorNapoleon IIIof the French ten years later, in 1851. During this trip, he promised that cousin of Louis Bonaparte that he would write a novel with the island's name in the title. In 1841 when Dumas made his promise, Louis Bonaparte himself was imprisoned at the citadel of Ham – the place mentioned in the novel. Dumas did visit him there,[29]although Dumas does not mention it in ""Etat civil""."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/219,Heart of Darkness,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness,"The novella opens on ""the sea-reach of theThames"" whereCharles Marlowtells his friends that ""when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago"" they would have sensed ""the savagery, the utter savagery"" surrounding them. Marlow then relates how he became captain of a river steamboat for anivory tradingcompany. He tells of his fascination as a child for ""the blank spaces"" on maps, particularly in Africa. The image of a river on the map particularly drew his attention.

In a flashback, Marlow makes his way to Africa by taking passage on a steamer. He travels 30 mi (50 km) up the river to where his company's station is. Work on a railway is taking place. Marlow explores a narrow ravine, and is horrified to find himself in a place full of critically ill Africans who worked on the railroad and are now dying. Marlow must wait for ten days in the company's devastated Outer Station. Marlow meets the company's chief accountant, who tells him of aMr. Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading post, and is described as a respected first-class agent. The accountant predicts that Kurtz will go far.

Marlow departs with 60 men to travel to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he will command is based. At the station, he learns that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident. The general manager informs Marlow that he could not wait for Marlow to arrive, and tells him of a rumour that Kurtz is ill. Marlow fishes his boat out of the river and spends months repairing it. Delayed by the lack of tools and replacement parts, Marlow is frustrated by the time it takes to perform the repairs. He learns that Kurtz is resented, not admired, by the manager. Once underway, the journey to Kurtz's station takes two months.

The journey pauses for the night about 8 miles (13 km) below the Inner Station. In the morning the boat is enveloped by a thick fog. The steamboat is later attacked by a barrage of arrows, and the helmsman is killed. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers away.

After landing at Kurtz's station, a man boards the steamboat: a Russian wanderer who strayed into Kurtz's camp. Marlow learns that the natives worship Kurtz and that he has been very ill. The Russian tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and admires Kurtz even for his power and his willingness to use it. Marlow suspects that Kurtz has gone mad.

Marlow observes the station and sees a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, Kurtz appears with supporters who carry him as a ghost-like figure on a stretcher. The area fills with natives ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something and they retreat. His entourage carries Kurtz to the steamer and lays him in a cabin. The manager tells Marlow that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region because his methods are ""unsound"". The Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings were discussed.

After midnight, Kurtz returns to shore. Marlow finds Kurtz crawling back to the station house. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he did not accomplish more. The next day they prepare to journey back down the river.

Kurtz's health worsens during the trip. The steamboat breaks down, and while stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him weakly whisper, ""The horror! The horror!"" A short while later, the manager's boy announces to the crew that Kurtz has died (the famous line ""Mistah Kurtz—he dead"" would become theepigraphofT. S. Eliot's poem ""The Hollow Men""). The next day Marlow pays little attention to Kurtz's pilgrims as they bury ""something"" in a muddy hole.

Returning to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the ""civilised"" world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée. When Marlow visits her, she is deep in mourning although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Marlow tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.

The novella was not a big success during Conrad's life.[20]When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, ""Youth"" and ""The End of the Tether"", it received the least commentary from critics.[20]F. R. Leavisreferred toHeart of Darknessas a ""minor work"" and criticised its ""adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery"".[21]Conrad did not consider it to be particularly notable;[20]but by the 1960s it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.[22]

Literary criticHarold Bloomwrote thatHeart of Darknesshad been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's ""unique propensity for ambiguity"".[23]InKing Leopold's Ghost(1998),Adam Hochschildwrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects ofHeart of Darkness, while paying scant attention to Conrad's accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. ""Heart of Darknessis experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case"".[24]Other critiques include Hugh Curtler'sAchebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness(1997).[25]The French philosopherPhilippe Lacoue-LabarthecalledHeart of Darkness""one of the greatest texts of Western literature"" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on ""The Horror of the West"".[26]

Heart of Darknessis criticised inpostcolonialstudies, particularly by Nigerian novelistChinua Achebe.[27][28]In his 1975 public lecture ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad'sHeart of Darkness"", Achebe described Conrad's novella as ""an offensive and deplorable book"" thatdehumanisedAfricans.[29]Achebe argued that Conrad, ""blinkered ... withxenophobia"", incorrectly depicted Africa as the antithesis of Europe and civilisation, ignoring the artistic accomplishments of theFang peoplewho lived in the Congo River basin at the time of the book's publication. He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that ""depersonalises a portion of the human race"" and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.[27][30]

Achebe's critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow's view from Conrad's, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella.[31]In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his scepticism about the moral superiority of European men.[32]Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, Marlow remarks: ""After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings."" Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples.[33]Jeffrey Meyersnotes that Conrad, like his acquaintanceRoger Casement, ""was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from theRenaissanceto theGreat War, to attack the hypocritical justification ofcolonialismand to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.""[34]: 100–01Likewise,E.D. Morel, who led international opposition toKing Leopold II's rule in the Congo, saw Conrad'sHeart of Darknessas a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as ""the most powerful thing written on the subject.""[35]

Conrad scholarPeter Firchowwrites that ""nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference"". If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, sinceHeart of Darknessacknowledges racial distinctions ""but does not suggest an essential superiority"" of any group.[36][37]Achebe's reading ofHeart of Darknesscan be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad's other African story, ""An Outpost of Progress"", which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow.[citation needed]Masood Ashraf Rajahas suggested that Conrad's positive representation ofMuslimsin hisMalaynovels complicates these charges of racism.[38]

In 2003, Motswana scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was ""the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe"".[39]Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara, however, broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be ""sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa"".[40]The novelistCaryl Phillipsstated in 2003 that: ""Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe"".[41]

In his 1983 criticism, the British academic Cedric Watts criticises the insinuation in Achebe's critique—the premise that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella, as well as mentioning that Achebe's critique falls into self-contradictory arguments regarding Conrad's writing style, both praising and denouncing it at times.[29]Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison ofHeart of DarknesswithJungle Tales of Tarzan, ""The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people"".[42]More recent critics like Nidesh Lawtoo have stressed that the ""continuities"" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of ""postcolonial mimesis"" ties the two authors via productive mirroring inversions.[43]

Orson Wellesadapted and starred inHeart of Darknessin aCBS Radiobroadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series,The Mercury Theatre on the Air. In 1939, Welles adapted the story for his first film forRKO Pictures,[44]writing a screenplay withJohn Houseman. The story was adapted to focus on the rise of afascistdictator.[44]Welles intended to play Marlow and Kurtz[44]and it was to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It is reportedly lost. The film's prologue to be read by Welles said ""You aren't going to see this picture - this picture is going to happen to you.""[44]The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak ofWorld War II. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio seriesThis Is My Best. Welles scholarBret Woodcalled the broadcast of 13 March 1945, ""the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.""[45]: 95, 153–156, 136–137

In 1991, Australian author/playwrightLarry Buttrosewrote and staged a theatrical adaptation titledKurtzwith the Crossroads Theatre Company,Sydney.[46]The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by theVision Australia RadioNetwork,[47]and also by the RPH –Radio Print Handicapped Networkacross Australia. In 2011, composerTarik O'Reganand librettistTom Phillipsadapted anopera of the same name, which premiered at theLinbury Theatreof theRoyal Opera Housein London.[48]A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it.[49]In 2015, an adaptation of Welles' screenplay byJamie LloydandLaurence Bowenaired onBBC Radio 4.[50]The production starredJames McAvoyas Marlow. Another BBC Radio 4 adaptation, first broadcast in 2021, transposes the action to the 21st century.[51]

In 1958, theCBStelevision anthologyPlayhouse 90(S3E7) aired a loose 90-minute television play adaptation. This version, written byStewart Stern, uses the encounter between Marlow (Roddy McDowall) and Kurtz (Boris Karloff) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son. The cast includesInga SwensonandEartha Kitt.[52]

Perhaps the best known adaptation isFrancis Ford Coppola's 1979 filmApocalypse Now, based on the screenplay byJohn Milius, which moves the story from the Congo toVietnamandCambodiaduring theVietnam War.[53]InApocalypse Now,Martin Sheenstars as Captain Benjamin L. Willard, aUS ArmyCaptain assigned to ""terminate the command"" of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played byMarlon Brando. A film documenting the production, titledHearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, was released in 1991. It chronicles a series of difficulties and challenges that director Coppola encountered during the making of the film, several of which mirror some of the novella's themes.

A 1993 television filmadaptation was written byBenedict Fitzgeraldand directed byNicolas Roeg. The film, which was aired byTNT, starredTim Rothas Marlow,John Malkovichas Kurtz,Isaach de Bankoléas Mfumu, andJames Foxas Gosse.[54]James Gray's 2019 science fiction filmAd Astrais loosely inspired by the events of the novel. It featuresBrad Pittas an astronaut travelling to the edge of theSolar Systemto confront and potentially kill his father (Tommy Lee Jones), who has gone rogue.[55]

In 2020,African Apocalypse, a documentary film directed and produced by Rob Lemkin and featuring Femi Nylander portrays a journey fromOxford, England toNigeron the trail of a colonial killer called CaptainPaul Voulet. Voulet's descent into barbarity mirrors that of Kurtz in Conrad'sHeart of Darkness. Nylander discovers Voulet's massacres happened at exactly the same time that Conrad wrote his book in 1899. It was broadcast by theBBCin May 2021 as an episode of theArenadocumentary series.[56]

A British animated film adaption of the novella is planned, directed by Gerald Conn. It was written by Mark Jenkins and Mary Kate O Flanagan and is produced by Gritty Realism andMichael Sheen. Kurtz is voiced by Sheen and Harlequin byAndrew Scott.[57]The animation uses sand to better convey atmosphere of the book.[58]A Brazilian animated film (2023) also adapts the novella. It is directed by Rogério Nunes and Alois Di Leo and moves the story to a near futureRio de Janeiro.[59][60][61]

The video gameFar Cry 2, released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation ofHeart of Darkness. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive ""Jackal"". The last area of the game is called ""The Heart of Darkness"".[62][63][64]

Spec Ops: The Line, released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation ofHeart of Darkness. The player assumes the role ofDelta ForceoperatorCaptain Martin Walkeras he and his team searchDubaifor survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to Joseph Conrad.[65]

T. S. Eliot's 1925 poem ""The Hollow Men"" quotes, as its first epigraph, a line fromHeart of Darkness: ""Mistah Kurtz – he dead.""[66]Eliot had planned to use a quotation from the climax of the tale as the epigraph forThe Waste Land, butEzra Poundadvised against it.[67]Eliot said of the quote that ""it is much the most appropriate I can find, and somewhat elucidative.""[68]BiographerPeter Ackroydsuggested that the passage inspired or at least anticipated the central theme of the poem.[69]

Chinua Achebe's 1958 novelThings Fall Apartis Achebe's response to what he saw as Conrad's portrayal of Africa and Africans as symbols: ""the antithesis of Europe and therefore civilization"".[70]Achebe set out to write a novel about Africa and Africans by an African. InThings Fall Apartwe see the effects of colonialism and Christian missionary endeavours on an Igbo community in West Africa through the eyes of that community's West African protagonists.

Another literary work with an acknowledged debt toHeart of DarknessisWilson Harris' 1960postcolonial novelPalace of the Peacock.[71][72][73]J. G. Ballard's 1962climate fictionnovelThe Drowned Worldincludes many similarities to Conrad's novella. However, Ballard said he had read nothing by Conrad before writing the novel, prompting literary critic Robert S. Lehman to remark that ""the novel's allusion to Conrad works nicely, even if it is not really an allusion to Conrad"".[74][75]

Robert Silverberg's 1970 novelDownward to the Earthuses themes and characters based onHeart of Darknessset on the alien world of Belzagor.[76]InJosef Škvorecký's 1984 novelThe Engineer of Human Souls, Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism and, there and elsewhere, Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad's concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.[77]

Timothy Findley's 1993 novelHeadhunteris an extensive adaptation that reimagines Kurtz and Marlow as psychiatrists in Toronto. The novel begins: ""On a winter's day, while a blizzard raged through the streets of Toronto, Lilah Kemp inadvertently set Kurtz free from page 92 ofHeart of Darkness.""[78][79]Ann Patchett's 2011 novelState of Wonderreimagines the story with the central figures as female scientists in contemporary Brazil.[80][81]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600,War and Peace,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace,"The novel begins in July 1805 inSaint Petersburg, at asoiréegiven by Anna Pavlovna Scherer, themaid of honourand confidante to thedowager empressMaria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon.Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhovis the illegitimate son of a wealthycount. He is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance, since the count is dying after a series of strokes. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old count's illegitimate progeny. They respect Pierre during the soirée because his father, Count Bezukhov, is a very rich man, and as Pierre is his favorite, most aristocrats think that the fortune of his father will be given to him even though he is illegitimate.

Also attending the soirée is Pierre's friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life, feeling that his wife is empty and superficial. Pierre does not quite know what to do with this and is made uncomfortable witnessing the marital discord. Pierre was sent to Petersburg by his father to choose a career but is uncomfortable because he cannot find one and people frequently ask about it. Andrei tells Pierre he has decided to becomeaide-de-campto PrinceMikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzovin thecoming war(the Battle of Austerlitz) againstNapoleonin order to escape a life he cannot stand.

The plot moves toMoscow, Russia's former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Saint Petersburg. The Rostov family is introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but worried about their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer. Boris's mother is Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, a childhood friend of the countess Natalya Rostova. Boris is also the godson of Pierre's father, Count Bezukhov. Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage to a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age.

At Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father and suspicion that the young man would be unfaithful to her.

The second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. At theSchöngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now anensignin thehussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted byTsar Alexander's charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov, and Denisov are involved in the disastrousBattle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard.

The Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching ""day [will] be hisToulon, or hisArcola"",[18]references to Napoleon's early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, ""so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended"".[19]Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory atBorodinoduring the1812 invasion.

Book Two begins with Nikolai Rostov returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from hisPavlograd Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Denisov falls in love with her and proposes marriage but is rejected. Nikolai meets Dolokhov, and they grow closer as friends. Dolokhov falls in love with Sonya, Nikolai's cousin, but as she is in love with Nikolai, she rejects Dolokhov's proposal. Nikolai meets Dolokhov sometime later. The resentful Dolokhov challenges Nikolai at cards, and Nikolai loses every hand until he sinks into a 43,000-ruble debt. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, he refuses. Instead, he promises to marry his childhood crush and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya.

Pierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in Russian society. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter Hélène (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hélène, who is rumored to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatole, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hélène is also rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hélène denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins theFreemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate hisserfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.

Pierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.

Burdened withnihilisticdisillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is interested inpanentheismand the possibility of an afterlife.

Pierre's wife, Hélène, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hélène establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society.

Prince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Saint Petersburg, naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Saint Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei's father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, insisting that the couple wait a year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau.

Natasha visits the Moscow opera, where she meets Hélène and her brother Anatole. Anatole has since married a Polish woman whom he abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei's sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole's marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill.

Pierre is initially horrified by Natasha's behavior but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As theGreat Comet of 1811–12streaks across the sky, life appears to begin anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha's breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal.

With the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon's army and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself throughgematriathat Napoleon is theAntichristof theBook of Revelationand that Pierre himself has aneschatologicalrole. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.

Back in Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience ofTzar Alexanderand manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of theCathedral of the Assumptionby the Tzar. He is nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist.

Napoleon himself is the main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over four hundred thousand troops of the FrenchGrande Armée(only one hundred and forty thousand of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city ofSmolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch theBattle of Borodinofrom a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil, he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eugène's artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon's reputedly invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in such disarray that no one can be notified.

The Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it became clear that Kutuzov had retreated past Moscow. The Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either flee or fight.Count Fyodor Rostopchin, the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religiousicons, while at the same time urging them to fight with pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn the city. However, Tolstoy states that the burning of an abandoned city mostly built of wood was inevitable, and while the French blame the Russians, these blame the French. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is among the wounded.

When Napoleon's army finally occupies an abandoned andburning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a naïve mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.

Pierre saves the life of a French officer who, seeking shelter, enters the home of a dead friend of Pierre's, in which Pierre has been living since departing his own home. The two have a long, amicable conversation. The next day Pierre goes into the street to resume his assassination plan. He rescues a young girl from a burning house and then comes across two French soldiers robbing an Armenian family. When one of the soldiers tries to rip the necklace off the young Armenian woman's neck, Pierre intervenes by attacking the soldiers, and is taken prisoner by the French army.

After his capture, Pierre believes he will be executed. In the end he is spared, but witnesses the execution of other prisoners with horror. Pierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harshRussian winter. After months of tribulation—during which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French—Pierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.

Meanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow toYaroslavl. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. In an internal transformation, he loses the fear of death and forgives Natasha in a last act before dying.

As the novel draws to a close, Pierre's wife Hélène dies from an overdose of anabortifacient(Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei's death and Pierre of Karataev's. Both are aware of a growing bond between them in their bereavement.

The first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813. Nikolai becomes worried about his family's finances and leaves the army after hearing of Petya's death. There is little hope for recovery. Given the Rostovs' ruin, he does not feel comfortable with the prospect of marrying the wealthy Marya Bolkonskaya, but when they meet again, they both still feel love for each other. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. Although he finds marrying women for money repugnant, he gives in to his love for Princess Maria and marries her.

Nikolai and Maria then move to her inherited estate of Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. Nikolai and Maria have children together, and also raise Prince Andrei's orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky.

As in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couples – Pierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Maria – remain devoted. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of theDecembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father ""would be satisfied"" (presumably as arevolutionaryin the Decembrist revolt).

The second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-centuryGreat Man Theoryclaims that historical events are the result of the actions of ""heroes"" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (a summation which he earlier, in Part III chapter 1, compared tocalculus, and the sum ofinfinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis, and free will being based onconsciousnessand therefore inherently unpredictable. Tolstoy also ridicules newly emerging Darwinism as overly simplistic, comparing it to plasterers covering over the windows,icons, and scaffolding with plaster, impressed with the smooth result. He wrestles with the tension between our consciousness of freedom and the apparent need for necessity to develop laws of science and history, saying at times that the first is as real as the second, and yet that its reality would destroy the second. He concludes that just as astronomy had to adopt the Copernican hypothesis of the earth's movement, not because it fits our immediate perceptions, but to avoid absurdities, so too must historical science accept some conception of necessary laws of human action, even though we feel free in our ordinary lives. In an appendix, he tries to further resolve the tension with the suggestion that we are most free, or feel most free, in arbitrary acts affecting us alone, but less free in acts affecting other people, where moral or other principles force or forbid certain responses.

War and Peaceis Tolstoy's longest work, consisting of 361 chapters. Of those, 24 are philosophical chapters with the author's comments and views, rather than narrative. These chapters discuss historical events but do not touch on the fictional plot of the novel.

The novel that made its author ""the true lion of theRussian literature"" (according toIvan Goncharov)[20][21]enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (byDmitry Pisarev,Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars.[21]Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaperGolos(The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: ""What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?... Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?""[21]

Writer and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing inVsemirny Trud(#6, 1867), suggested thatWar and Peacewas ""neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel"", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. ""The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century,"" was his suggestion. ""It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life,"" wroteIvan Turgenevin his bid to defineWar and Peacein the foreword for his French translation of ""The Two Hussars"" (published in Paris byLe Tempsin 1875).

In general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the ""author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel"", as criticVarfolomey Zaytsevput it.[22]Articles byD. Minayev,Vasily Bervi-FlerovskyandN. ShelgunovinDelomagazine characterized the novel as ""lacking realism"", showing its characters as ""cruel and rough"", ""mentally stoned"", ""morally depraved"" and promoting ""the philosophy of stagnation"". Still,Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with ""how strongly this Count has stung our higher society"".[23]Dmitry Pisarevin his unfinished article ""Russian Gentry of Old"" (Staroye barstvo,Otechestvennye Zapiski, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing ""unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards"" the Russiandvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and ""patriotic"" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the ""patriotic feelings of our fathers"" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.[21]

One of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue ofVestnik Evropy. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. ""The dazzling side of the novel,"" according to Annenkov, was ""the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them."" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two ""greatraznotchintsys"",SperanskyandArakcheyev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel ""this relatively rough but original element."" In the end the critic called the novel ""the whole epoch in the Russian fiction.""[21]

Slavophilesdeclared Tolstoy their ""bogatyr"" and pronouncedWar and Peace""the Bible of the new national idea"". Several articles onWar and Peacewere published in 1869–70 inZaryamagazine byNikolay Strakhov. ""War and Peaceis the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before"", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. ""It is now quite clear that from 1868 when theWar and Peacewas published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning"", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of a level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of ""meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind"" (usingApollon Grigoryev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own bookThe World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoryev's concept (of ""Russian meeknessvs.Western bestiality"") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.[24]

Among the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of theRussky Invalidnewspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called theBattle of Schöngrabernscenes ""bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness"" and totally agreed with the author's view on theBattle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writerMikhail Dragomirov, in an article published inOruzheiny Sbornik(The Military Almanac, 1868–70), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the ""spontaneity"" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to useWar and Peaceas their desk book, describing its battle scenes as ""incomparable"" and ""serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.""[21]

Unlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaringWar and Peacethe masterpiece ofRussian literature.Ivan Goncharovin a July 17, 1878, letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating intoDanishWar and Peace, adding: ""This is positively what might be called a RussianIliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever"".[25]In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosenAnna Kareninato start with, Goncharov insisted: ""War and Peaceis the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.""[26]In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance ofWar and Peace. ""Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]"", he remarked.[27]

Fyodor Dostoevsky(in a May 30, 1871, letter to Strakhov) describedWar and Peaceas ""the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that."" In a draft version ofThe Raw Youthhe described Tolstoy as ""a historiograph of thedvoryanstvo, or rather, its cultural elite."" ""The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools,"" he added.[28]In 1876 Dostoevsky wrote: ""My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge—not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.""[29]

Nikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer inBirzhevy Vestnik(The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highlyWar and Peace, calling it ""the best ever Russian historical novel"" and ""the pride of the contemporary literature"". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for ""having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved"". ""While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers"", Leskov wrote.[21]

Afanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870, letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. ""You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it"", he added.[30]

Ivan Turgenevgradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel's historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaperLe XIXeSiècle, Turgenev described Tolstoy as ""the most popular Russian writer"" andWar and Peaceas ""one of the most remarkable books of our age.""[31]""This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there's true, real Russia,"" Turgenev wrote.[32]It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of theWar and Peace(1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.[21]

Since then many world-famous authors have praisedWar and Peaceas a masterpiece of world literature.Gustave Flaubertexpressed his delight ina January 1880 letterto Turgenev, writing: ""This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.""[33]LaterJohn GalsworthycalledWar and Peace""the best novel that had ever been written"".Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote, ""This work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.""[34]Thomas MannthoughtWar and Peaceto be ""the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.""[35]WhenVirginia Woolffinished the book, she declared ""There remains the greatest of all novelists—for what else can we call the author ofWar and Peace?""[36]Ernest Hemingwayconfessed that it was from Tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to ""write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way."" ""I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did"", Hemingway asserted in his 1955Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Timeanthology.[21]

Isaac Babelsaid, after readingWar and Peace, ""If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.""[37]Tolstoy ""gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.""[38]

War and Peacehas been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translatorsConstance GarnettandAylmer and Louise Maudeknew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoy's often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. Only about two percent ofWar and Peaceis in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later.[14]Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French; Briggs and Shubin use no French, while Pevear–Volokhonsky's and Amy Mandelker's revisions of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.[14]

Translation of draft of 1863:

In theEncyclopedia of Literary Translation into English, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit has this to say about the translations ofWar and Peaceavailable in 2000: ""Of all the translations ofWar and Peace, Dunnigan's (1968) is the best. ... Unlike the other translators, Dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris's mother pronounced his name with a stress on theo– an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady's affectation.""

On the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: ""her ...War and Peaceis frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms. Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi."" On the Maudes' translation she comments: ""this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes' lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general, place this version below Dunnigan's."" She further comments on Edmonds's revised translation, formerly onPenguin: ""[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude.""[39]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/768,Wuthering Heights,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights,"In 1801,Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange inYorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord,Heathcliff, at his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.

Lockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper Ellen ""Nelly"" Dean tells him the story of the strange family.

Thirty years earlier, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their two children, Hindley and Catherine, and a servant—Nelly herself. Returning from a trip toLiverpool, Earnshaw brings home an orphan whom he names Heathcliff. Heathcliff's origins are unclear but he is described as ""like a gipsy"" and possibly, aLascaror an American or Spanish castaway.[6]Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his wife dies. Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.

Hindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his father three years later. He and his new wife Frances force Heathcliff to live as one of their servants and subject him to much verbal and emotional abuse.

Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella live nearby at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff and Catherine spy on them out of curiosity. When Catherine is attacked by their dog, the Lintons take her in, but send Heathcliff home. The Lintons visit, and Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is then made to live in the manor's unheated, dusty attic and swears that he will one day have his revenge.

Frances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar. She confesses to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help him, but feels she cannot marry him because of his low social status. Nelly warns her against associating with a man like Heathcliff. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding Catherine's heart, flees the household. Distraught, Catherine falls ill.

Three years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine now wed and expecting children, Heathcliff unexpectedly returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella's infatuation with him as a means of revenge on Catherine. Enraged by Heathcliff's constant presence at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar banishes him. Catherine responds by locking herself in her room and refusing food; she never fully recovers. At Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff exploits Hindley'sgamblingaddiction and compels him to mortgage the estate to cover his losses. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella, but the relationship fails and they soon return.

When Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying, he visits her in secret. She dies shortly after giving birth to a daughter,Cathy, and Heathcliff rages, calling on her ghost to haunt him for as long as he lives. Isabella, bitter over Heathcliff's devotion to a dead woman, flees south where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, a sickly boy named Linton. Hindley dies six months later ofalcoholism, and Heathcliff then takes possession of Wuthering Heights as its new master.

Twelve years later, after Isabella's death, the still-sickly Linton is brought back to live with his uncle Edgar at the Grange, but Heathcliff insists that his son must instead live with him. Cathy and Linton (respectively at the Grange and Wuthering Heights) gradually develop a relationship. Heathcliff schemes to ensure that they marry in order to ensure his claim to Thrushcross Grange, and on Edgar's death demands that the couple move in with him. He becomes increasingly wild and reveals that on the night Catherine died he dug up her grave, and ever since has been plagued by her ghost. When Linton unexpectedly dies, Cathy has no option but to remain at Wuthering Heights.

Having reached the present day, Nelly's tale concludes.

Lockwood grows tired of the moors and moves away. Eight months later he returns for a visit, and Nelly, now the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, tells him what has happened since he left.

Heathcliff gave up his opposition to Cathy and Hareton's union. He declined physically and started seeing visions of the dead Catherine; he avoided the young couple, saying that he could not bear to see Catherine's eyes, which they both shared, looking at him. He eventually stopped eating, and some days later was found dead in Catherine's old room.

Cathy has been teaching the still-uneducated Hareton to read. They plan to marry and move to the Grange, accompanied by Nelly, with Joseph being left to take care of Wuthering Heights. Nelly reports that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff wandering abroad together. Lockwood seeks out the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff, and is convinced that all three are finally at peace.

The original text as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847 is available online in two parts.[11]The novel was first published together with Anne Brontë'sAgnes Greyin athree-volume format:Wuthering Heightsfilled the first two volumes andAgnes Greymade up the third.

In 1850 Charlotte Brontë edited the original text for the second edition ofWuthering Heightsand also provided it with her foreword.[12]She addressed the faulty punctuation and orthography but also diluted Joseph's thick Yorkshire dialect. Writing to her publisher, W. S. Williams, she said that

Irene Wiltshire, in an essay on dialect and speech, examines some of the changes Charlotte made.[3]

Early reviews ofWuthering Heightswere mixed. Most critics recognised the power and imagination of the novel, but were baffled by the storyline, and objected to the savagery and selfishness of the characters.[14]In 1847, when the background of an author was given great importance in literary criticism, many critics were intrigued by the authorship of the Bell novels.[15]

TheAtlasreview called it a ""strange, inartistic story"", but commented that every chapter seems to contain a ""sort of rugged power.""[16]

Graham's Lady Magazinewrote: ""How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors"".[17]

The English poet and painterDante Gabriel Rossettiadmired the book, writing in 1854 that it was ""the first novel I've read for an age, and the best (as regards power and sound style) for two ages, exceptSidonia"",[21]but, in the same letter, he also referred to it as ""a fiend of a book – an incredible monster  ... The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there"".[22]

Rossetti's friend, the poetAlgernon Charles Swinburnewas another early admirer of the novel, and in conclusion for an essay on Emily Brontë, published inThe Athenaeumin 1883, writes: ""As was the author's life, so is her book in all things: troubled and taintless, with little of rest in it, and nothing of reproach. It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts; it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose.""[23]

Until late in the 19th century ""Jane Eyrewas regarded as the best of the Brontë sisters' novels"". This view began to change in the 1880s with the publication ofA. Mary F. Robinson's biography of Emily in 1883.[24]

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/135,Les Misérables,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables,"In 1815Digne, the peasantJean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in theBagne of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.

Digne's benevolentBishop Myrielgives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.

Valjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-soucoin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and panics, searching the city for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him because if he is apprehended, he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.

Six years pass, and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor ofMontreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, InspectorJavert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.

Years earlier in Paris, agrisettenamedFantinewas very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle, were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès's daughter,Cosette. When Fantine arrives atMontfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of theThénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.

Fantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate, and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth and resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.

Adandynamed Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists, but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.

Javert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.

After Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.

Valjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in theBagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.

Valjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her while pampering their own daughters,ÉponineandAzelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to give Cosette a present of an expensive new doll, which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behavior, caring only that he pays for his food and lodging.

The next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back towards home.

Valjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at the Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette, and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener, and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.

Eight years later, theFriends of the ABC, led byEnjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanistcivil unrest (i.e., theParis uprising on 5–6 June 1832, a setting contrary to the popular notion that the book is set in the 1789French Revolution)[29][30]following the death ofLamarque, a popular general known for his sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of theCour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son,Gavroche, who is astreet urchin.

One of the students,Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially hisroyalistgrandfather, M. Gillenormand) because of hisBonapartistviews. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life atWaterloo—in reality, Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant underNapoleonto avoid exposing himself as a robber.

At theLuxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname Jondrette at the Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.

Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing ""The Cops Are Here"" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the ""Jondrettes"" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).

The philanthropist and his daughter—actually Valjean and Cosette—enter. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises to return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid ofPatron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.

Marius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him, revealing his true identity. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.

He tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, saying they will keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone and announces the address is a fake.

It is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier, and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.

He arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (exceptClaquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, andMontparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.

After Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at ""the Field of the Lark"" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette, andBrujonmanage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean and Cosette's house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week, which greatly troubles the pair.

The next day, Valjean is sitting in theChamp de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap. It says, ""Move Out."" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes home, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and restates that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses to consent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.

The following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that he is a spy. When Enjolras confronts Javert about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius returns to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet but finds it no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.

When Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot him. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, and a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.

Marius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for him earlier calls him by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.

The author also tells the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to having obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him but deciding to do so for fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was ""a little bit in love"" with him, and dies.

Marius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is from Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.

Valjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still uncertain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.

Valjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier doesn't recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean's and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can determine his identity later. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer to distract the policeman who has been pursuing him.

Upon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly, Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks for a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window, he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but cannot ignore his duty to the law either. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into theSeine.

Marius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris duringMardi Grasfestivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius's judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.

Thénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean by revealing all the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is a murderer and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier about his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America, where he becomes a slave trader.

As they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab inPère Lachaise Cemetery."

The children working there receive very little food; after six months, they draw lots, with the loser asking for another portion ofgruel. Oliver is designated, and so he approaches the master of the workhouse, basin and spoon in hand, and says : 'Please, sir, I want some more'. A great uproar ensues at this perceived act of rebellion.

Oliver is removed from the workhouse and put in solitary confinement; he is flogged every day by the beadle, Mr Bumble, of which three times a week in front of the other boys. After some time Oliver is offered at a premium as anapprentice; he is taken on byMr Sowerberry, anundertaker. One day, his jealous co-apprentice, Noah Claypole, insults Oliver's mother and an enraged Oliver attacks him. When he is punished by Mr Bumble and Mr Sowerberry, Oliver runs away to London to seek a better life.

Oliver meets a young man named Jack Dawkins who calls himself ""the Artful Dodger"", offers him food and lodging and takes him to meet an infamous criminal known asFagin, who trains orphan boys as pickpockets. Oliver innocently begins Fagin's training, but when he goes out with the Dodger and another boy and sees them stealing a handkerchief from an old gentleman named Mr Brownlow, he realizes the truth. While the Dodger and the other boy escape, Oliver is pursued, apprehended, formally arrested and tried before Magistrate Fang. Interceding for Oliver, Brownlow takes him home and cares for him. As Oliver recovers, Brownlow and his housekeeper notice that Oliver resembles a woman depicted in a portrait hanging in Brownlow's home.

Worried that Oliver might incriminate him and his gang, Fagin sends a young woman namedNancyand her abusive lover, the robberBill Sikes, to abduct Oliver and bring him back to Fagin's lair. Fagin forces him to participate in a burglary planned by Sikes. The robbery goes wrong; while Sikes escapes, Oliver, after having been wounded, ends up in the care of the people he was supposed to rob: Miss Rose and her guardian Mrs Maylie.

A mysterious man, known only as ""Monks"", teams up with Fagin, to prevent Oliver from learning of his past. Monks bribes Mr Bumble and his new wife, the former Widow Corney, for information on Oliver. Together, they dispose of a ring and medallion that had once belonged to Oliver's mother and had been stolen from her after she died. Nancy, racked with guilt for her role in Oliver's kidnapping, secretly spies on them and passes the information on to Rose Maylie, who tells Mr Brownlow. Meanwhile, the Artful Dodger is arrested for pickpocketing, tried and sentenced totransportation to Australia.

Noah Claypole, who had fled to London with the Sowerberrys' maid Charlotte after robbing Mr Sowerberry, joins Fagin's gang. Following Fagin's orders, he follows Nancy and discovers that she meets with Mr Brownlow and Rose for the sake of Oliver's welfare. Fearing that Nancy has betrayed him and Sikes (which, unknown to him, she has refused to do), Fagin passes the information on to Sikes, who beats Nancy to death in a fit of rage and goes into hiding. He is recognised by an angry mob and attempts to flee. Going to Toby Crackit's hideout, he learns that Fagin has been arrested. When the mob catches up to him, he tries to escape over the rooftops by swinging on a rope, but while he is about to loop the rope about himself a vision of the dead Nancy's staring eyes terrorises him into losing his balance; in the fall, the looped rope catches him around the neck and hangs him.

Mr Brownlow has Monks arrested and forces him to divulge his secrets: he is actually Oliver's half-brother and had hoped to steal Oliver's half of their rightful inheritance. Brownlow begs Oliver to give half his inheritance to Monks and grant him a second chance, to which Oliver happily agrees. Monks emigrates to America, but squanders his money, relapses into crime and dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and sentenced to the gallows. The day before his execution, Oliver and Mr Brownlow visit him inNewgate Prisonand learn the location of the documents proving Oliver's identity.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/514,Little Women,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women,"Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, and their mother, whom they call Marmee, live in a new neighborhood (loosely based onConcord) inMassachusettsingenteel poverty. Having lost all his money, their father is serving as achaplainfor theUnion Armyin theAmerican Civil War, far from home. The mother and daughters face their firstChristmaswithout him. When Marmee asks them to give their Christmasbreakfastaway to animpoverishedfamily, the girls and their mother venture into town, laden with baskets, to feed the hungry children. When they return, they discover their wealthy, elderly neighbor, Mr. Laurence, has sent over a decadent surprise dinner, to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted following these acts of kindness.

Meg and Jo must work to support the family: Megtutorsa nearby family of four children; Jo assists her agedgreat-auntMarch, a wealthywidowliving in amansionin Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is atomboywho writes, Beth is a peacemaker and apianist, and Amy is anartistwho longs for elegance andfine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters, as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. Laurie, Mr. Laurence's orphaned grandson, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo.

The girls keep busy as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can't comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties andcotillionsfor the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor.

Word comes that Mr. March is ill withpneumoniaand Marmee leaves to nurse him inWashington, DC. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her, but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence, instead, sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to marry, so, Brooke agrees to wait.

While Marmee is in Washington, Beth contractsscarlet fever, after spending time with a poor family, where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises the family send for Marmee. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy.

While Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After being wounded, he returns to find work, so he can buy a house for when he and Meg marry. Laurie goes to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns home.

(Published separately in the United Kingdom asGood Wives)

Three years later, Meg and John wed and work to adjust to married life. When they havetwins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel neglected. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing.

Laurie graduates from college, doing well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak, due to complications from scarlet fever, lowering her spirits. While trying to understand Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it is with Beth, but soon senses it is with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother but does not love him in a romantic way.

Jo wants a little adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will overcome his feelings. She spends six months in New York City with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house, serving asgovernessfor her two children. Jo takes German lessons from another boarder, Professor Friedrich Bhaer. He has come from Berlin to care for his sister's orphaned sons. For extra money, Jo anonymously writes salacious romance stories for sensational newspapers. Suspecting her secret, Friedrich mentions such writing is unprincipled and base, which persuade Jo to give up that literary genre. As Jo's time in New York ends, she is unaware that Friedrich is in love with her. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage, which she declines.

Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's scarlet fever has left her permanently weakened. Jo becomes devoted to caring for her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe and slowly falls in love with her, seeing her in a new light. She is unimpressed by his aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude since being rejected by Jo. She inspires him to find his purpose in life and do something worthwhile. News of Beth's death brings them together and a romance soon grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return home with Laurie and his grandfather unchaperoned. Amy and Laurie marry before leaving Europe.

Friedrich, in Massachusetts on business, visits the Marches daily for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo, who realizes she loves him and they become engaged. Because Friedrich is poor, he must first establish a good income and goes west to teach. A year passes without much success. Later, Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate, Plumfield, to Jo. She marries Friedrich and turns the house into a school for boys. They have two sons, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and five grandchildren.

Meg, the oldest sister, is 16, when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and she manages the household, when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and she is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfils expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect ""little woman,"" in the eyes of the world.[14]Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of ""little women"".[15]

Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father's family's social standing, Meg makes herdebutinto high society, but she is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie's tutor. They have twins, Margaret ""Daisy"" Brooke and John Laurence ""Demi"" Brooke. The sequel,Little Men,mentions a baby daughter, Josephine ""Josie"" Brooke,[16]who is 14, at the beginning of the final book.[17]

According to Sarah Elbert, ""democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all, a secure identity that Meg lacks"".[7]: 204Others believe Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life and writes her with loving detail, suffused with sentimentality.[18]

The principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.[19][20]

Second oldest of the four sisters, Jo is masculine, the smartest, most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his ""son Jo,"" and her best friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, sometimes calls her ""my dear fellow,"" while she, alone, calls him Teddy. Jo has a ""hot"" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister, Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo.[21]In her essay, ""Recollections of My Childhood,"" Alcott refers to herself as a tomboy who enjoyed boys' activities, like running foot-races and climbing trees.

Jo lovesliterature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Laurie proposes marriage to Jo, which she rejects, thus confirming her independence. Another reason for the rejection is that the love that Laurie has for Jo is more a brotherly love, rather than romantic love, the difference between which he was unable to understand, because he was ""just a boy,"" as said by Alcott in the book.

After Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when ""they decide to share life's burdens, just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition"".[7]: 210She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred, until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March's home, a year later. According to criticBarbara Sicherman, ""The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.""[22]: 21They have two sons, Robert ""Rob"" Bhaer and Theodore ""Ted"" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part ofLittle Womenduring the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, ""her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence"".[7]: 199

Beth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family.[23]: 53Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family, and she gently scolds her sisters, when they argue.[24]As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth developsscarlet fever, after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease, but her health is permanently weakened.

As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually, she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew ""heavy.""  Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss duringLittle Womenis the death of beloved Beth. Her ""self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life, knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.""[7]: 206–207

Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family; she's 12, when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a ""regular snow-maiden,"" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, ""pale and slender"" and ""always carrying herself"" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family.[25]Often coddled, because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way, though she does still love her family.[26]: 5She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name, rather than a diminutive.[27]

Amy's aunt chooses her to accompany her to Europe, rather than her sister, Jo. There, she matures and makes a decision, based on her limited artistic talent, how to direct her adult life. She encounters Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence and his grandfather during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well in upper-class society and is at ease with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development, and her success in life seemed relatively accidental.[26]However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she can confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work hard to gain what she wants and make the most of her success, when she has it. She marries Laurie after Jo rejected him. They have a daughter, Elizabeth ""Bess"" Laurence, named after her late sister, Beth.[28]

For her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters inLittle Womenare recognizably drawn from family members and friends.[3][4]: 202Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister, was the model for Beth. Like Beth, Lizzie was quiet and retiring. She died tragically at age twenty-three from the lingering effects of scarlet fever, as did Beth.[39]May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls.[4]: 202Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as ""Miss March"" or ""Jo"", and she did not correct them.[40][41]: 31

However, Alcott's portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of theAmerican Civil War, a gainfully employedchaplain, and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel.[41]: 51In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters.[41]: 51The March family is portrayed as living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger.[42]In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised thatLittle Womenwas also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own early life.[29]: 6Originally, Alcott did not want to publishLittle Women, claiming she found it boring, and wasn't sure how to write girls as she knew few beyond her sisters. However, encouraged by her editor Thomas Niles, she wrote it within 10 weeks.[43]

Also,Little Womenhas several textual and structural references toJohn Bunyan'snovelThe Pilgrim's Progress.[44]Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the book and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times toThe Pilgrim's Progressand liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. Several chapter titles directly reference characters and places fromThe Pilgrim's Progress.

In addition to drawing on her own life during the development ofLittle Women,Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including ""The Sisters' Trial"", ""A Modern Cinderella"", and ""In the Garret"". The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott's own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters inLittle Women.[45]

The first volume ofLittle Womenwas published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers.[46]The first edition included illustrations byAbigail May Alcott, the sister commonly called ""May"" who inspired the fictional Amy March. She ""struggled"" with her illustrative additions to her sister's book, but later improved her skills and found some success as an artist.[47]

The first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with the demand for additional printings. They announced: ""The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott'sLittle Women, the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness.""[9]: 37The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume states: ""So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.""[48]Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year's Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.[10]: 345

Versions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine bothLittle WomenandGood Wivesinto one book under the titleLittle Women, with the latter marked as Part 2 (chapters 24 to 47).[49]Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with: ""In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.""[48]

The British influence, giving Part 2 its own title,Good Wives, has the book still published in two volumes, withGood Wivesbeginning three years afterLittle Womenends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed underLittle Womenappear to include both parts, especially in the audiobook versions.[citation needed]Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s to 2015.[citation needed]This split of the two volumes also shows at Goodreads, which refers to the books as theLittle Womenseries, includingLittle Women,Good Wives,Little MenandJo's Boys.[50][51][52]

G. K. Chestertonbelieved Alcott inLittle Women, ""anticipatedrealismby twenty or thirty years"", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, ""is one of the really human things in human literature"".[53]Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of ""pilgrims progress"" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.[54]

Little Womenwas well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a ""scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood"", which led more women to look toward ""literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.""[22]: 2Little Womenbecame ""the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured"".[22]: 3Adult elements of women's fiction inLittle Womenincluded ""a change of heart necessary"" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.[7]: 199

In the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of ""a decline in the radical power of women's fiction"", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a ""hearth and home"" children's story.[7]: 197Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of this ""downward spiral"". But Elbert says thatLittle Womendid not ""belittle women's fiction"" and that Alcott stayed true to her ""Romantic birthright"".[7]: 198–199

Little Women's popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown ""within the familiar construct of domesticity"".[7]: 220While Alcott had been commissioned to ""write a story for girls"", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a ""new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories"".[22]: 3–4

One reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.[22]: 3–4""Both the passionLittle Womenhas engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.""[22]: 35

At the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her ""who the little women marry"".[22]: 21Sicherman said that the ending, which she personally characterizes as ""unsatisfying"", worked to ""keep the story alive"" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.[22]: 21Anne E. Boyd contends that ""Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writingLittle Women"".[55]Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. In Sicherman's opinion, Alcott used Friedrich to ""subvert adolescent romantic ideals"" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo.[22]: 21However, the character was partially based upon older men Alcott was attracted to, such asHenry David ThoreauandRalph Waldo Emerson,[31][35]or admired, such as German writersCharles FollenandJohann Wolfgang von Goethe.[35][32][33]In particular, Alcott had considered Goethe her ""chief idol"" since the day Emerson had introduced her to Goethe and handed her a copy ofWilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship[34]Bhaer is also representative of Alcott's reverence forGerman culture.[56]

In 2003Little Womenwas ranked number 18 inThe Big Read, a survey of the British public by theBBCto determine the ""Nation's Best-loved Novel"" (not children's novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list.[57]Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted it as one of its ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[58]In 2012 it was ranked number 47 among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal, a monthly with primarily US audience.[59]

Little Womenhas been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report inThe New York Timesand cited inLittle Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays.[60]Ruth MacDonald argued that ""Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls' novel and the family story"".[61]

In the 1860s, gendered separation of children's fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs ""as class stratification increased"".[22]: 18Joy Kasson wrote, ""Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them.""[62]Girls related to the March sisters inLittle Women, along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.[22]: 22

After readingLittle Women,some women felt the need to ""acquire new and more public identities,"" however dependent on other factors, such as financial resources.[22]: 55WhileLittle Womenshowed the regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also ""legitimized"" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities.[22]: 36More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and ""stories of individual achievement—traditionally coded male—challenged women's socialization into domesticity"".[22]: 55Little Womenalso influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into the middle-class culture.

In the pages ofLittle Women, young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles.[22]: 35Little Womenrepeatedly reinforced the importance of ""individuality"" and ""female vocation"".[22]: 26Little Womenhad ""continued relevance of its subject"" and ""its longevity points, as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s"".[22]: 35Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages ofLittle Womento see how a ""democratic household"" would operate.[7]: 276

While ""Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity,"" she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society, solely because they were not married.[7]: 193""Little Womenindisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood, by insisting that the home and the women's sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world, while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements."" As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular, Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood, because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.[7]: 199

Alcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse asMaxine Hong Kingston,Margaret Atwood, andJ. K. Rowlinghave noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.[63]

Alcott's novel is often celebrated for Jo and her narrative arch in which she becomes a self-determined woman with a career. However, framing this novel as a success, solely for Jo's accomplishments, portrays it as a ""traditional 'lone genius' patriarchal narrative"" in which only women who are ""categorized as 'exceptional' or particularly 'worthy'"" are celebrated.[64]Little Womenawards all its women worthy, despite their status as conventional or unconventional—not just Jo, who is the obvious exception to societal expectation. Alcott's novel celebrates the agency of women, the four sisters and their mother, to choose their path in life. Meg makes the decision to marry and have children and though it is the traditional pathway, she makes the choice for her own happiness. Thus, reducing Alcott's novel to just Jo's experience as an exception promotes it as a patriarchal narrative and erases her careful work to portray a matriarchal narrative, rich with female agency and voice.

Alcott ""made women's rights integral to her stories, and above all, toLittle Women"".[7]: 193Alcott's fiction became her ""most important feminist contribution""—even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights"".[7]: 193She thought that ""a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society."" InLittle Women, she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth-century feminist utopia.[7]: 194

Holmes and Watson meet and, after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes is a ""consulting detective"", and his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes'sdeductiveskills, Watson's disbelief turns into astonishment.

Atelegramrequests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to thecrime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson andLestradeare already on the scene. The victim is Enoch Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is ""RACHE"" (German for ""revenge""), which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber's body, they discover a woman's gold wedding ring.

Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys afacsimileof it, hoping to draw the murderer – who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring – out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise.

A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He went to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson stayed before the murder. Drebber, a drunk, attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. He, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with acudgelbut claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.

Stangerson is later murdered. His body is found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written ""RACHE"". The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying ""J.H. is in Europe"", and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sicklyScottish Terrierin residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier.

A young street urchin named Wiggins then arrives. He is the leader of theBaker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins has summoned a cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. The captive cabby is Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

In Utah'sSalt Lake Valleyin 1847, John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party ofpioneers, are rescued from death by a party ofLatter-day Saintsled byBrigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later in 1860, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church's Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn never to marry his daughter to a Mormon, sends word to Hope.

Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope arrives on the eve of the last day, and they all escape under cover of darkness.  The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed by Stangerson while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies less than a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson but begins to suffer from anaortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. After returning years later, he learns Drebber and Stangerson have fledSalt Lake Cityafter a schism between the Mormons. Drebber is now wealthy from Lucy's estate and Stangerson has become his secretary. For over 20 years Hope pursues them; in Cleveland, Ohio, Hope recognizes Drebber who has Hope imprisoned for a few months as a ""rival in love"". After being released, Hope tracks them to Europe through France, Russia, Denmark and to England.

In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier's son, Drebber gets into Hope's cab and spends hours drinking. Hope then takes him to the house on Brixton Road and forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write ""RACHE"" on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills. However, Stangerson attacks him and Hope stabs him in the heart.

Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he deduced the murderer's identity. In the newspapers, Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

Arthur Conan Doylewrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks.[4]As a doctor in general practice inSouthsea,Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodicalLondon Society. The story was originally titledA Tangled Skeinand was eventually published byWard, Lock & Co. in the 1887 edition ofBeeton's Christmas Annual, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed forroyaltybut instead received £25 in return for the full rights (equivalent to £3,371.95 considering inflation). It was illustrated byDavid Henry Friston.

The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock & Co, and featured drawings by the author's father,Charles Doyle. In 1890,J. B. Lippincott & Co.released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock & Bowden Limited (formerly Ward, Lock & Co.) was illustrated byGeorge Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt.[5]Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.

According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter-day Saints' organisation as being steeped inkidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: ""all I said about theDaniteBand and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It's best to let the matter rest.""[6]Conan Doyle's daughter has stated: ""You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.""[6]Historians speculate that ""Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books byFannie Stenhouse,William A. Hickman, William Jarman,John HydeandAnn Eliza Young, among others"",[6]in explaining the author's early perspective on Mormonism.

Years after Conan Doyle's death,Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that the author had privately apologised, saying that ""He [Conan Doyle] said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church""[6]and had ""written a scurrilous book about the Mormons.""[7]

In August 2011, theAlbemarle County, Virginia, school board removedA Study in Scarletfrom the district's sixth-grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons.[8][9]It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth-graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.[10]

As the first Sherlock Holmes story published,A Study in Scarletwas among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a Britishsilent filmbe produced byG. B. Samuelson. In the film, titledA Study in Scarlet, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story.[11]As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now alost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 filmThe Valley of Fear.[12]

A two-reel short film, also titledA Study in Scarlet, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starredFrancis Fordas Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.[12]

The 1933 film titledA Study in Scarlet, starringReginald Owenas Holmes andAnna May Wongas Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel.[13]Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names (Jabez Wilson, etc.).[13]The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later inAgatha Christie's novelAnd Then There Were None.[14]

Edith MeiseradaptedA Study in Scarletinto a four-part serial for the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, withRichard Gordonas Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.[15]

Parts of the story were combined with ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" for the script of ""Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes"", one of multiple radio adaptations featuringJohn Gielgudas Holmes andRalph Richardsonas Watson. The episode first aired on theBBC Light Programmeon 5 October 1954 and also aired onNBC Radioon 2 January 1955.[16]

The story was adapted for the1952–1969 BBC radio seriesin 1962 byMichael Hardwick, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson. It aired on theBBC Home Service.[17]

Another British radio version of the story adapted by Hardwick aired on 25 December 1974, withRobert Powellas Holmes andDinsdale Landenas Watson. The cast also includedFrederick Trevesas Gregson,John Hollisas Lestrade, andDon Fellowsas Jefferson Hope.[18]

A radio dramatisation of the story aired onCBS Radio Mystery Theaterduring its1977 season, withKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[19]

A Study in Scarletwas adapted as the first two episodes of the BBC's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series. The two-part adaptation aired onRadio 4in 1989, dramatised byBert Coulesand starringClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, andJohn Moffattas Inspector Gregson.[20]

It was adapted as a 2007 episode of the American radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes, Lawrence Albert as Watson,Rick Mayas Lestrade, and John Murray as Gregson.[21]

In 2023, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the beginning of the story in its first episode, ""Mr Sherlock Holmes"", but only alloded to the mystery itself at the very end and in the following episode. It starred Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

The1954–1955 television series(withRonald Howardas Holmes andH. Marion Crawfordas Watson) used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode ""The Case of the Cunningham Heritage"".[22]

The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television seriesSherlock Holmes,[23]withPeter Cushingin the lead role andNigel Stockas Dr Watson.

It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979Soviettelevision film,Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson(the first episode combines the story of their meeting with ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band""; the second episode adapts the actual Jefferson Hope case).[24]

A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, withPeter O'Toolevoicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O'Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time.

A Study in Scarletis one of several stories not adapted forthe television seriesstarringJeremy Brettbetween 1984 and 1994.

Steven Moffatloosely adaptedA Study in Scarletinto ""A Study in Pink"" as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television seriesSherlockfeaturingBenedict Cumberbatchas a 21st-century Sherlock Holmes, andMartin Freemanas Dr Watson.[25]The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled ""RACHE"" and the two pills, and the killer's potentially fatalaneurysm(although it is located in his brain rather than his aorta). However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also featuresMoriarty's presence. The first meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted again in the Victorian setting in the special ""The Abominable Bride"".

""The Deductionist"", an episode ofElementary, contains many elements of Hope's case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, ""A Study in Charlotte"".

""The First Adventure"", the first episode of the 2014NHKpuppetry seriesSherlock Holmes, is loosely based onA Study in Scarletand ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons"". In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school calledBeeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. ""Scarlet Story"", the series' opening theme tune, is named after the novel.[26]The name of ""Beeton School"" is partially inspired byBeeton's Christmas Annual.[27]

A Study in Scarletwas illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz forClassics Illustratedcomics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form byInnovation Publishingin 1969 by James Stenstrum and illustrated by Noly Panaligan, bySterling Publishingin 2010 byIan Edgintonand illustrated byI. N. J. Culbard, and by Hakon Holm Publishing in 2013 illustrated
by Nis Jessen.[28]

In 2014,A Study in Scarletwas adapted for the stage by Greg Freeman, Lila Whelan and Annabelle Brown for Tacit Theatre.[29]The production premiered atSouthwark Playhousein London in March 2014.[30]

In February 2019, a new adaptation of ""A Study in Scarlet"" was staged at DM Performance Works at the Factory in Nuremberg, PA. It was adapted by Bill Amos under the title ""Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Avenger"".[31]

In June 2022,Pitlochry Festival Theatreproduced a new adaptation by playwright and actor Lesley Hart,Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Lipstick, Ketchup and Bloodperformed in an outdoor amphitheater by two performers. The production usesA Study in Scarletas a play within a play set in a post-apocalyptic future.[32]

In hisNaked Is the Best Disguise(1974),Samuel Rosenbergnotes the similarity between Jefferson Hope's tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence inJames Joyce's novelUlysses, though of course Joyce's work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg's book.

The British fantasy and comic book writerNeil Gaimanadapted this story to the universe of horror writerH. P. Lovecraft'sCthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled ""A Study in Emerald"" (2004) and is modelled with a parallel structure.

InGarage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders(2016), the second murder is an imitation of this murder.

InThe Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve, a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/120,Treasure Island,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island,"In the mid-18th century, an old sailor who identifies himself as ""The Captain"" starts to lodge at the rural Admiral Benbow Inn nearBristol. He tells the innkeeper's son,Jim Hawkins, to keep a lookout for ""a one-legged seafaring man"".

Black Dog, a pirate with missing fingers, recognises the captain as his former shipmate Billy Bones, and confronts him. They get into a cutlass fight; Black Dog flees, and Bones suffers a stroke. That night, Jim's father dies. Days later, Pew, a blind beggar, visits the inn, delivering a summons to Bones called ""the black spot"". Shortly thereafter, Bones suffers another stroke and dies.

Pew and his accomplices attack the inn but are attacked and routed by mounted excise officers, and Pew is trampled to death by one of their horses. Jim and his mother escape with a packet from The Captain's sea chest, which is found to contain a map of the island on which the infamous pirateCaptain Flinthid his treasure. Jim shows the map to the local physicianDr. LiveseyandSquire Trelawney, and they decide to make an expedition to the island, with Jim serving as a cabin boy.

They set sail from Bristol on aschoonerchartered by Trelawney, theHispaniola, underCaptain Alexander Smollett. Jim forms a strong bond with the ship's one-legged cook,Long John Silver. The crew suffers a tragedy when first mate Mr. Arrow, a drunkard, is washed overboard during a storm. While hidden in an apple barrel, Jim overhears a conversation among theHispaniola's crew which reveals that many of them are pirates who had served on Captain Flint's ship, theWalrus, with Silver leading them. They plan to mutiny after the salvage of the treasure, and to murder the captain and the few remaining loyal crew. Jim secretly informs Captain Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey.

Arriving at the island and going ashore, Jim flees into the jungle after witnessing Silver murder a sailor for objections. He meets a marooned pirate namedBen Gunn, who is also a former member of Flint's crew. The mutineers arm themselves and take the ship, while Jim and Smollett's loyal band take refuge in an abandoned stockade on the island. After a brief truce, the mutineers attack the stockade, with casualties on both sides of the battle. Jim makes his way to theHispaniolaand cuts the ship from its anchor, drifting it along the ebb tide. He boards the ship and encounters the pirate Israel Hands, who had been injured in a drunken dispute with one of his companions. Hands helps Jim beach the schooner in the northern bay, then attempts to kill Jim with a dagger, but Jim shoots him dead with two pistols.

Jim goes ashore and returns to the stockade, where he is horrified to find only Silver and the pirates. Silver tells Jim that when everyone found the ship was gone, Captain Smollett's party had agreed to a truce whereby the pirates take the map and allow the besieged party to leave. In the morning, Livesey arrives to treat the wounded and sick pirates, and tells Silver to look out for trouble once he's found the site of the treasure. After a dispute over leadership, Silver and the others set out with the map, taking Jim along as a hostage. They find a skeleton with its arms oriented toward the treasure, unnerving the party. Ben Gunn shouts Captain Flint's last words from the forest, making the superstitious pirates believe that Flint's ghost is haunting the island. They eventually find a treasure cache, but it is empty. The pirates prepare to kill Silver and Jim, but they are driven off by the doctor's party, including Gunn. Livesey explains that Gunn had already found the bulk of the treasure and taken it to his cave, long ago. The expedition members load this portion of the treasure onto theHispaniolaand depart the island, with Silver as their only prisoner. At their first port, inSpanish America, Silver steals a bag of money and escapes. The remaining crew sail back toBristoland divide up the treasure. Some treasure was never found, but Jim refuses to return to the ""accursed"" island to look for it.

Treasure Islandwas written by Stevenson after returning from his first trip to America where he was married. Still a relatively unknown author, inspiration came in summer of 1881 inBraemar, Scotland when bad weather kept the family inside.[3]To amuse his 12-year old stepson,Lloyd Osbourne, he used the idea of a secret map as the basis of a story about hidden treasure.

He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, ""If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the Devon coast, that it's all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It's quite silly and horrid fun – and what I want is thebestbook about Buccaneers that can be had.""[4]

Stevenson originally gave the book the titleThe Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of theYoung Folksmagazine.[5]After completing several chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness.[6]He left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. The book was later republished as the novelTreasure Islandand proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success.

The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 whenDaniel Defoe'sRobinson Crusoewas published. A century later, novels such asS. H. Burney'sThe Shipwreck(1816), andSir Walter Scott'sThe Pirate(1822) continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors in the mid-19th century continued this trend, with works includingJames Fenimore Cooper'sThe Pilot(1823). During the same period,Edgar Allan Poewrote ""MS Found in a Bottle"" (1833) and ""The Gold-Bug"" (1843). All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product.[7]

Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a letter from July 1884 toSidney Colvin, he wrote that, ""Treasure Islandcame out ofKingsley'sAt Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest — and that was the seed — and out of the greatCaptain Johnson'sHistory of the Notorious Pirates."" Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton fromPoe'sThe Gold-Bugand he constructedBilly Bones's history from the ""Money-Diggers"" section (""Golden Dreams"" in particular[8]) ofTales of a TravellerbyWashington Irving, one of his favourite writers.[9]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/55,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz,"Dorothy Galeis a young girl who lives with herAunt Em,Uncle Henry, and dog,Toto, on a farm on theKansasprairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a ""cyclone"" (more accurately atornado) that deposits them and the farmhouse intoMunchkin Countryin the magicalLand of Oz. The falling house has killed theWicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of theMunchkins. TheGood Witch of the Northarrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magicalsilver shoesthat originally belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home to Kansas is to follow theyellow brick roadto theEmerald Cityand ask the great and powerfulWizard of Ozto help her. As Dorothy embarks on her journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving her magical protection from harm.

On her way down the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin namedBoq. The next day, she frees aScarecrowfrom the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted joints of aTin Woodman, and meets aCowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard.

After several adventures, the travelers arrive at the Emerald City and meet theGuardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. He appears to Dorothy as a giant head, to the Scarecrow as a lovely lady, to the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and to the Lion as a ball of fire, with the intention of scaring them all. He agrees to help them all if they kill theWicked Witch of the West, who rules overWinkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the Witch of the West.

The Wicked Witch of the West sees the travelers approaching with her one telescopic eye. She sends a pack of wolves to tear them to pieces, but the Tin Woodman kills them with his axe. She sends a flock of wild crows to peck their eyes out, but the Scarecrow kills them by twisting their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they are killed while trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's straw hides the others. She sends a dozen of her Winkie slaves to attack them, but the Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses the power of her Golden Cap to send theWinged Monkeysto capture Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion. She cages the Lion, scatters the straw of the Scarecrow, and dents the Tin Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the witch's personal slave, while the Witch schemes to steal her silver shoes' powerful magic.

The witch successfully tricks Dorothy out of one of her silver shoes. Angered, she throws a bucket of water at the witch and is shocked to see her melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed from her tyranny and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the witch's Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her friends back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and his band are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceressGayelettefrom the North, and that Dorothy may use it to summon them two more times.

When Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, Toto tips over a screen in a corner of the throne room that reveals ""the Wizard"", who sadly explains he is a humbug—an ordinary old man who, by a hot air balloon, came to Oz long ago fromOmaha. He provides the Scarecrow with a head full of bran, pins, and needles (""a lot of bran-new brains""), the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Lion a potion of ""courage"". Their faith in his power gives these items a focus for their desires. He decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and then go back to Omaha in his balloon. At the send-off, he appoints the Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy goes after him, but the ropes holding the balloon break and the Wizard floats away.

Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys and tells them to carry her and Toto home, but they explain they cannot cross the desert surrounding Oz. TheSoldier with the Green Whiskersinforms Dorothy thatGlinda, the Good Witch of the Southmay be able to help her return home, so the travelers begin their journey to see Glinda's castle inQuadling Country. On the way, the Lion kills a giant spider who is terrorizing the animals in a forest. They ask him to become their king, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys a third time to fly them over a hill to Glinda's castle.

Glinda greets them and reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes can take her anywhere she wishes to go. She embraces her friends, all of whom will be returned to their new kingdoms through Glinda's three uses of the Golden Cap: the Scarecrow to the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman to Winkie Country, and the Lion to the forest; after which the cap will be given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, freeing him and his band. Dorothy takes Toto in her arms, knocks her heels together three times, and wishes to return home. Instantly, she begins whirling through the air and rolling on the grass of the Kansas prairie, up to the farmhouse, though the silver shoes fall off her feet en route and are lost in theDeadly Desert. She runs to Aunt Em, saying ""I'm so glad to be home again!""

The book was illustrated by Baum's friend and collaboratorW. W. Denslow, who also co-held the copyright. The design was lavish for the time, with illustrations on many pages, backgrounds in different colors, and several color plate illustrations.[12]The typeface featured the newly designedMonotype Old Style. In September 1900, TheGrand Rapids Heraldwrote that Denslow's illustrations are ""quite as much of the story as in the writing"". The editorial opined that had it not been for Denslow's pictures, the readers would be unable to picture precisely the figures of Dorothy, Toto, and the other characters.[13]

Denslow's illustrations were so well known that merchants of many products obtained permission to use them to promote their wares. The forms of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, and Dorothy were made into rubber and metal sculptures. Costume jewelry, mechanical toys, and soap were also designed using their figures.[14]The distinctive look of Denslow's illustrations led to imitators at the time, most notably Eva Katherine Gibson'sZauberlinda, the Wise Witch, which mimicked both the typography and the illustration design ofOz.[15]

A new edition of the book appeared in 1944, with illustrations by Evelyn Copelman.[16][17]Although it was claimed that the new illustrations were based on Denslow's originals, they more closely resemble the characters as seen in the famous1939 film versionof Baum's book.[18]

According to Baum's son,Harry Neal, the author had often told his children ""whimsical stories before they became material for his books"".[19]Harry Baum called his father the ""swellest man I knew"", a man who was able to give a decent reason as to whyblack birds cooked in a piecould afterwards get out and sing.[19]

Many of the characters, props, and ideas in the novel were drawn from Baum's personal life and experiences.[20]Baum held different jobs, moved a lot, and was exposed to many people, so the inspiration for the story could have been taken from many different aspects of his life.[20]In the introduction to the story, Baum writes that ""it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out"".[21]

As a child, Baum frequently had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field.[22]Moments before the scarecrow's ""ragged hay fingers"" nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow.[23]In the early 1880s, Baum's playMatcheswas being performed when a ""flicker from a kerosene lantern sparked the rafters"", causing the Baum opera house to be consumed by flames. Scholar Evan I. Schwartz suggested that this might have inspired the Scarecrow's severest terror: ""There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of. A lighted match.""[24]

According to Baum's son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a wash-boiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and from the bottom of a saucepan he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman.[25]

Baum's wifeMaud Gagefrequently visited their newborn niece, Dorothy Louise Gage, whom she adored as the daughter she never had. The infant became gravely sick and died at the age of five months inBloomington, Illinois, on November 11, 1898, from ""congestion of the brain"". Maud was devastated.[26]To assuage her distress, Baum made his protagonist ofThe Wonderful Wizard of Oza girl named Dorothy, and he dedicated the book to his wife.[27]The baby was buried atEvergreen Cemetery, where her gravestone has a statue of the character Dorothy placed next to it.[28]Baum's mother-in-law, activistMatilda Joslyn Gage, has also been cited as one of the inspirations for Dorothy.[29]

Decades later,Jocelyn Burdick—the daughter of Baum's other niece, Magdalena Carpenter, and a formerDemocraticU.S. SenatorfromNorth Dakota—asserted that her mother also partly inspired the character of Dorothy.[30]Burdick claimed that her great-uncle spent ""considerable time at the Сarpenter homestead ... and became very attached to Magdalena"".[30]Burdick has reported many similarities between her mother's homestead and the farm of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.[30]

Uncle Henrywas modeled after Henry Gage, Baum's father-in-law. Bossed around by his wifeMatilda, Henry rarely dissented with her. He flourished in business, though, and his neighbors looked up to him. Likewise, Uncle Henry was a ""passive but hard-working man"" who ""looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke"".[31]

The witches in the novel were influenced bywitch-huntingresearch gathered by Matilda Joslyn Gage. The stories of barbarous acts against accused witches scared Baum. Two key events in the novel involve wicked witches who meet their death through metaphorical means.[32]Baum's biographers have also drawn correlations between Baum'sGood Witchand Gage's feminist writings.[29]

In 1890, Baum lived inAberdeen, South Dakotaduring a drought, and he wrote a story in his ""Our Landlady"" column in Aberdeen'sThe Saturday Pioneerabout a farmer who gave green goggles to his horses, causing them to believe that the wood chips that they were eating were pieces of grass.[33]Similarly, the Wizard made the people in the Emerald City wear green goggles so that they would believe that their city was built from emeralds.[34]

During Baum's short stay in Aberdeen, the dissemination of myths about the West continued. However, the West, instead of being a wonderland, turned into a wasteland because of a drought and a depression. In 1891, Baum moved his family from South Dakota to Chicago. At that time, Chicago was getting ready for theWorld's Columbian Expositionin 1893. Scholar Laura Barrett stated that Chicago was ""considerably more akin to Oz than to Kansas"". After discovering that the myths about the West's incalculable riches were baseless, Baum created ""an extension of the American frontier in Oz"". In many respects, Baum's creation is similar to the actual frontier save for the fact that the West was still undeveloped at the time. The Munchkins Dorothy encounters at the beginning of the novel represent farmers, as do the Winkies she later meets.[35]

Local legend has it that Oz, also known as the Emerald City, was inspired by a prominent castle-like building in the community of Castle Park nearHolland, Michigan, where Baum lived during the summer. The yellow brick road was derived from a road at that time paved by yellow bricks, located inPeekskill, New York, where Baum attended thePeekskill Military Academy. Baum scholars often refer to the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (the ""White City"") as an inspiration for the Emerald City. Other legends suggest that the inspiration came from theHotel Del Coronadonear San Diego, California. Baum was a frequent guest at the hotel and had written several of the Oz books there.[36]In a 1903 interview withThe Publishers' Weekly,[37]Baum said that the name ""Oz"" came from his file cabinet labeled ""O–Z"".[38][22]

Some critics have suggested that Baum's Oz may have been inspired by Australia. Australia is often colloquially spelled or referred to as ""Oz"". Furthermore, inOzma of Oz(1907), Dorothy gets back to Oz as the result of a storm at sea while she and Uncle Henry are traveling by ship to Australia. Like Australia, Oz is an island continent somewhere to the west of California with inhabited regions bordering on a great desert. Baum perhaps intended Oz to be Australia or a magical land in the center of the great Australian desert.[39]

In addition to being influenced by the fairy-tales of theBrothers GrimmandHans Christian Andersen,[40]Baum was significantly influenced by English writerLewis Carroll's 1865 novelAlice's Adventures in Wonderland.[41]Although Baum found the plot of Carroll's novel to be incoherent, he identified the book's source of popularity asAliceherself—a child with whom younger readers could identify, and this influenced Baum's choice of Dorothy as his protagonist.[40]

Although influenced by Carroll's distinctly English work, Baum nonetheless sought to create a story that had recognizable American elements, such as farming and industrialization.[42]Consequently, Baum combined the conventional features of afairy talesuch aswitchesandwizardswith well-known fixtures in his young readers' Midwestern lives such asscarecrowsandcornfields.[43]

The original illustrator of the novel,W. W. Denslow, aided in the development of Baum's story and greatly influenced the way it has been interpreted.[22]Baum and Denslow had a close working relationship and worked together to create the presentation of the story through the images and the text.[22]Color is an important element of the story and is present throughout the images, with each chapter having a different color representation. Denslow also added characteristics to his drawings that Baum never described. For example, Denslow drew a house and the gates of the Emerald City with faces on them.

In the laterOzbooks,John R. Neill, who illustrated all the sequels, continued to use elements from Denslow's earlier illustrations, including faces on the Emerald City's gates.[44]Another aspect is the Tin Woodman's funnel hat, which is not mentioned in the text until later books but appears in most artists' interpretation of the character, including the stage and film productions of 1902–1909, 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1931, 1933, 1939, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1992, and others. One of the earliest illustrators not to include a funnel hat was Russell H. Schulz in the 1957Whitman Publishingedition—Schulz depicted him wearing a pot on his head. Libico Maraja's illustrations, which first appeared in a 1957 Italian edition and have also appeared in English-language and other editions, are well known for depicting him bareheaded.

The Wonderful Wizard of Ozreceived positive critical reviews upon release. In a September 1900 review,The New York Timespraised the novel, writing that it would appeal to child readers and to younger children who could not read yet. The review also praised the illustrations for being a pleasant complement to the text.[45]

During the subsequent decades after the novel's publication in 1900, it received little critical analysis from scholars of children's literature. Lists of suggested reading published for juvenile readers never contained Baum's work,[46]and his works were rarely assigned in classrooms.[47]This lack of interest stemmed from the scholars' misgivings about fantasy, as well as to their belief that lengthy series had little literary merit.[46]

It frequently came under fire in later decades. In 1957, the director of Detroit's libraries bannedThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozfor having ""no value"" for children of today, for supporting ""negativism"", and for bringing children's minds to a ""cowardly level"". ProfessorRussel B. NyeofMichigan State Universitycountered that ""if the message of the Oz books—love, kindness, and unselfishness make the world a better place—seems of no value today"", then maybe the time is ripe for ""reassess[ing] a good many other things besides the Detroit library's approved list of children's books"".[48]

In 1986, sevenFundamentalist Christianfamilies in Tennessee opposed the novel's inclusion in the public school syllabus and filed a lawsuit.[49]They based their opposition to the novel on its depicting benevolent witches and promoting the belief that integral human attributes were ""individually developed rather than God-given"".[49]One parent said: ""I do not want my children seduced into godless supernaturalism.""[50]Other reasons included the novel's teaching that females are equal to males and that animals are personified and can speak. The judge ruled that when the novel was being discussed in class, the parents were allowed to have their children leave the classroom.[51]

In April 2000, theLibrary of CongressdeclaredThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozto be ""America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale"", also naming it the first American fantasy for children and one of the most-read children's books.[7]Leonard Everett Fisher ofThe Horn Book Magazinewrote in 2000 thatOzhas ""a timeless message from a less complex era, and it continues to resonate"". The challenge of valuing oneself during impending adversity has not, Fisher noted, lessened during the prior 100 years.[52]Two years later, in a 2002 review, Bill Delaney ofSalem Presspraised Baum for giving children the opportunity to discover magic in the mundane things in their everyday lives. He further commended Baum for teaching ""millions of children to love reading during their crucial formative years"".[43]In 2012 it was ranked number 41 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published bySchool Library Journal.[53]

After George M. Hill's bankruptcy in 1902, copyright in the book passed to theBowen-Merrill CompanyofIndianapolis, which published most of Baum's other books from 1901 to 1903, both reprints (Father Goose, His Book,The Magical Monarch of Mo,American Fairy Tales,Dot and Tot of Merryland) and new works (The Master Key,The Army Alphabet,The Navy Alphabet,The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus,The Enchanted Island of Yew,The Songs of Father Goose). Bowen-Merrill's 1903 edition initially had the titleThe New Wizard of Oz, to distinguish it fromthe 1902 musical, which was by then better known than the original book and had a very different story.[54]The word ""New"" was quickly dropped in subsequent printings, leaving the now-familiar shortened title,The Wizard of Oz, and some minor textual changes were added, such as to ""yellow daises"", and changing a chapter title from ""The Rescue"" to ""How the Four Were Reunited"". The editions they published lacked most of the in-text color and color plates of the original. Many cost-cutting measures were implemented, including removal of some of the color printing without replacing it with black, printing nothing rather than the beard of theSoldier with the Green Whiskers.

When Baum filed for bankruptcy after his critically and popularly successful film and stage productionThe Fairylogue and Radio-Playsfailed to make back its production costs, Baum lost the rights to all of the books published by what was now called Bobbs-Merrill, and they were licensed to the M. A. Donahue Company, which printed them in significantly cheaper ""blotting paper"" editions with advertising that directly competed with Baum's more recent books, published by theReilly & BrittonCompany, from which he was making his living, explicitly hurting sales ofThe Patchwork Girl of Oz, the new Oz book for 1913, to boost sales ofWizard, which Donahue called in a full-page ad inThe Publishers' Weekly(June 28, 1913), Baum's ""one pre-eminently great Juvenile Book"". In a letter to Baum dated December 31, 1914, F. K. Reilly lamented that the averagebuyeremployed by a retail store would not understand why he should be expected to spend 75 cents for a copy ofTik-Tok of Ozwhen he could buy a copy ofWizardfor between 33 and 36 cents. Baum had previously written a letter complaining about the Donahue deal, which he did not know about until it was fait accompli, and one of the investors who heldThe Wizard of Ozrights had inquired why the royalty was only five or six cents per copy, depending on quantity sold, which made no sense to Baum.[55]

A new edition from Bobbs-Merrill in 1949 illustrated by Evelyn Copelman, again titledThe New Wizard of Oz, paid lip service to Denslow but was based strongly, apart from the Lion, on the MGM movie. Copelman had illustrated a new edition ofThe Magical Monarch of Motwo years earlier.[56]

It was not until the book entered the public domain in 1956 that new editions, either with the original color plates, or new illustrations, proliferated.[57]A revised version of Copelman's artwork was published in aGrosset & Dunlapedition, and Reilly & Lee (formerly Reilly & Britton) published an edition in line with the Oz sequels, which had previously treatedThe Marvelous Land of Ozas the first Oz book,[58]not having the publication rights toWizard, with new illustrations by Dale Ulrey.[17]Ulrey had previously illustratedJack Snow'sJaglon and the Tiger-Faries, an expansion of a Baum short story ""The Story of Jaglon"", and a 1955 edition ofThe Tin Woodman of Oz, though both sold poorly. Later Reilly & Lee editions used Denslow's original illustrations.

Notable more recent editions are the 1986 Pennyroyal edition illustrated byBarry Moser, which was reprinted by theUniversity of California Press, and the 2000The Annotated Wizard of Ozedited byMichael Patrick Hearn(heavily revised from a 1972 edition that was printed in a wide format that allowed for it to be a facsimile of the original edition with notes and additional illustrations at the sides), which was published byW. W. Nortonand included all the original color illustrations, as well as supplemental artwork byDenslow. Other centennial editions includedUniversity Press of Kansas'sKansas Centennial Edition, illustrated byMichael McCurdywith black-and-white illustrations, andRobert Sabuda'spop-up book."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2852,The Hound of the Baskervilles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles,"InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story ""The Final Problem"". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, ""The King of the Foxes"".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a ""monstrously evil man"". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of ""Love's Old Sweet Song"", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1399,Anna Karenina,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina,"The novel is divided into eight parts and 239 chapters. Itsepigraphis ""Vengeance is mine; I will repay"", fromRomans 12:19, which in turn quotes fromDeuteronomy 32:35. The novel begins with one of its most oft-quoted lines:

Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky (""Stiva""), aMoscowaristocratand civil servant, has been unfaithful to his wife, Princess Darya Alexandrovna (""Dolly""). Dolly has discovered his affair with the family's governess, and the household and family are in turmoil. Stiva informs the household that his married sister, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina, is coming to visit fromSaint Petersburgin a bid to calm the situation.

Meanwhile, Stiva's childhood friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin (""Kostya""), arrives in Moscow with the aim of proposing to Dolly's youngest sister, Princess Katerina Alexandrovna Shcherbatskaya (""Kitty""). Kostya is a passionate, restless, but shy aristocratic landowner who, unlike his Moscow friends, chooses to live in the country on his large estate. He discovers that Kitty is also being pursued by Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, an army cavalry officer.

Whilst at the railway station to meet his sister Anna, Stiva bumps into Vronsky who is there to meet his mother, the Countess Vronskaya. Anna and Vronskaya have travelled and talked together in the same carriage. As the family members are reunited and Vronsky sees Anna for the first time, a railway worker accidentally falls in front of a moving train carriage and is killed. Anna interprets this as an ""evil omen"".

At the Oblonsky home, Anna talks openly and emotionally to Dolly about Stiva's affair and convinces her that Stiva still loves her despite the infidelity. Dolly is moved by Anna's speeches and decides to forgive Stiva.

Kitty, who comes to visit Dolly and Anna, is just eighteen. In her first season as adebutante, she is expected to make an excellent match with a man of her own social standing. Vronsky has been paying her considerable attention, and she expects to dance with him at a ball that evening. Kitty is very struck by Anna's beauty and personality and becomes infatuated with her just as much as with Vronsky. When Kostya proposes to Kitty at her home, she clumsily turns him down, as she is in love with Vronsky and believes that he will propose to her; she was encouraged to do so by her mother, the Princess Shcherbatskaya, who believes Vronsky would be a better match (in contrast to Kitty's father, who favours Kostya).

At the ball Kitty expects to hear something definitive from Vronsky, but he dances with Anna instead, choosing her as a partner over a shocked and heartbroken Kitty. Kitty realises that Vronsky has fallen in love with Anna and has no intention of marrying her, despite his overt flirtations. Vronsky has regarded his interactions with Kitty merely as a source of amusement and assumes that Kitty has acted for the same reasons. Anna, shaken by her emotional and physical response to Vronsky, returns at once to St. Petersburg. Vronsky travels on the same train. During the overnight journey, the two meet and Vronsky confesses his love. Anna refuses him, although she is affected by his attentions.

Kostya, crushed by Kitty's refusal, returns to his estate, abandoning any hope of marriage. Anna returns to her husband, Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a senior government official, and her son, Seryozha, in St. Petersburg.

The Shcherbatskys consult doctors over Kitty's health, which has been failing since Vronsky's rejection. A specialist advises that Kitty should go abroad to a health spa to recover. Dolly speaks to Kitty and understands she is suffering because of Vronsky and Kostya, whom she cares for and had hurt in vain. Kitty, humiliated by Vronsky and tormented by her rejection of Kostya, upsets her sister by referring to Stiva's infidelity, saying she could never love a man who betrayed her. Meanwhile, Stiva visits Kostya on his country estate while selling a nearby plot of land.

In St. Petersburg, Anna begins to spend more time in the inner circle of Princess Elizaveta (""Betsy""), a fashionable socialite and Vronsky's cousin. Vronsky continues to pursue Anna. Although she initially tries to reject him, she eventually succumbs to his attentions and begins an affair. Meanwhile, Karenin reminds his wife of the impropriety of paying too much attention to Vronsky in public, which is becoming the subject of gossip. He is concerned about the couple's public image, although he mistakenly believes that Anna is above suspicion.

Vronsky, a keenhorseman, takes part in asteeplechaseevent, during which he rides hismareFrou-Frou too hard—his irresponsibility causing him to fall and break the horse's back. Anna is unable to hide her distress during the accident. Before this, Anna had told Vronsky that she is pregnant with his child. Karenin is also present at the races and remarks to Anna that her behavior is improper. Anna, in a state of extreme distress and emotion, confesses her affair to her husband. Karenin asks her to break it off to avoid further gossip, believing that their marriage will be preserved.

Kitty and her mother travel to a German spa to enable Kitty to recover from her ill health. There, they meet the wheelchair-usingPietistMadame Stahl, who is accompanied by the kind and virtuous Varenka, her adopted daughter. Influenced by Varenka, Kitty becomes extremely pious and concerned for others, but when her father joins them she becomes disillusioned after learning from him that Madame Stahl is faking her illness. She then returns to Moscow.

Kostya continues working on his estate, a setting closely tied to his spiritual thoughts and struggles. He wrestles with the idea of falseness, wondering how he should go about ridding himself of it, and criticizing what he feels is falseness in others. He develops ideas relating to agriculture, and the unique relationship between the agricultural laborer and his native land and culture. He comes to believe that the agricultural reforms of Europe will not work in Russia because of the unique culture and personality of the Russian peasant.

When Kostya visits Dolly, she attempts to understand what happened between him and Kitty and to explain Kitty's behavior. Kostya is very agitated by Dolly's talk about Kitty, and he begins to feel distant from Dolly as he perceives her loving behavior towards her children as false. Kostya resolves to forget Kitty and contemplates the possibility of marriage to a peasant woman. However, a chance sighting of Kitty in her carriage makes Kostya realise he still loves her. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, Karenin refuses to separate from Anna, insisting that their relationship will continue. He threatens to take away Seryozha if she persists in her affair with Vronsky.

When Anna and Vronsky continue seeing each other, Karenin consults a lawyer about obtaining a divorce. During the time period, a divorce in Russia could only be requested by the innocent party in an affair and required either that the guilty party confess or that the guilty party be discovered in the act of adultery. Karenin forces Anna to hand over some of Vronsky's love letters, which the lawyer deems insufficient as proof of the affair. Stiva and Dolly argue against Karenin's drive for a divorce.

Karenin changes his plans after hearing that Anna is at risk of death after the difficult birth of her daughter, Annie. At her bedside, Karenin forgives Vronsky. However, Vronsky, embarrassed by Karenin's kindness, unsuccessfully attempts suicide by shooting himself. As Anna recovers, she finds that she cannot bear living with Karenin despite his forgiveness and his attachment to Annie. When she hears that Vronsky is about to leave for a military posting inTashkent, she becomes desperate. Anna and Vronsky reunite and flee to Italy, leaving behind Seryozha and Karenin's offer of divorce.

Meanwhile, Stiva acts as a matchmaker with Kostya: he arranges a meeting between him and Kitty, which results in their reconciliation and engagement.

Kostya and Kitty marry and start their new life on his country estate. Although the couple are happy, they undergo a bitter and stressful first three months of marriage. Kostya feels dissatisfied at the amount of time Kitty wants to spend with him and dwells on his inability to be as productive as he was as a bachelor. When the marriage starts to improve, Kostya learns that his brother, Nikolai, is dying ofconsumption. Kitty offers to accompany Kostya on his journey to see Nikolai and proves herself a great help in nursing Nikolai. Seeing his wife take charge of the situation in an infinitely more capable manner than he could have done himself without her, Kostya's love for Kitty grows. Kitty eventually learns that she is pregnant.

In Italy, Vronsky and Anna struggle to find friends who will accept them. Whilst Anna is happy to be finally alone with Vronsky, he feels suffocated. They cannot socialize with Russians of their own class and find it difficult to amuse themselves. Vronsky, who believed that being with Anna was the key to his happiness, finds himself increasingly bored and unsatisfied. He takes up painting and makes an attempt to patronize an émigré Russian artist of genius. However, Vronsky cannot see that his own art lacks talent and passion, and that his conversation about art is extremely pretentious. Increasingly restless, Anna and Vronsky decide to return to Russia.

In St. Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky stay in one of the best hotels, but take separate suites. It becomes clear that whilst Vronsky is still able to move freely in Russian society, Anna is barred from it. Even her old friend, Princess Betsy, who has had affairs herself, evades her company. Anna starts to become anxious that Vronsky no longer loves her. Meanwhile, Karenin is comforted by Countess Lidia Ivanovna, an enthusiast of religious and mystic ideas fashionable with the upper classes. She advises him to keep Seryozha away from Anna and to tell him his mother is dead. However, Seryozha refuses to believe that this is true. Anna visits Seryozha uninvited on his ninth birthday but is discovered by Karenin.

Anna, desperate to regain at least some of her former position in society, attends a show at the theater at which all of St. Petersburg's high society are present. Vronsky begs her not to go, but he is unable to bring himself to explain to her why she cannot attend. At the theater, Anna is openly snubbed by her former friends, one of whom makes a deliberate scene and leaves the theater. Anna is devastated. Unable to find a place for themselves in St. Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky leave for Vronsky's country estate.

Dolly, her children, and her mother, the Princess Shcherbatskaya, spend the summer with Kostya and Kitty. The couple's life is simple and unaffected, although Kostya is uneasy at the ""invasion"" of so many Shcherbatskys. He becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors, Veslovsky, flirts openly with the pregnant Kitty. Kostya tries to overcome his jealousy, and briefly succeeds during a hunt with Veslovsky and Oblonsky, but eventually succumbs to his feelings and asks Veslovsky to leave. Veslovsky immediately goes to stay with Anna and Vronsky at their nearby estate.

When Dolly visits Anna, she is struck by the difference between Kostya and Kitty's aristocratic-yet-simple home life and Vronsky's overtly luxurious and lavish country estate. She is also unable to keep pace with Anna's fashionable dresses or Vronsky's extravagant spending on a hospital he is building. In addition, all is not quite well with Anna and Vronsky. Dolly notices Anna's anxious behavior and her uncomfortable flirtations with Veslovsky. Vronsky makes an emotional request to Dolly, asking her to convince Anna to seek a divorce from Karenin so that the two might marry and live normally.

Anna has become intensely jealous of Vronsky and cannot bear when he leaves her, even for short excursions. When Vronsky leaves for several days ofprovincial elections, Anna becomes convinced that she must marry him to prevent him from leaving her. After Anna writes to Karenin again seeking a divorce, she and Vronsky leave the countryside for Moscow.

While visiting Moscow for Kitty's confinement, Kostya quickly gets used to the city's fast-paced, expensive and frivolous society life. He accompanies Stiva to a gentleman's club, where the two meet Vronsky. Kostya and Stiva pay a visit to Anna, who is occupying her empty days by being a patroness to an orphaned English girl. Kostya is initially uneasy about the visit, but Anna easily puts him under her spell. When he admits to Kitty that he has visited Anna, she accuses him of falling in love with her. The couple are later reconciled, realizing that Moscow society life has had a negative, corrupting effect on Kostya.

Anna cannot understand why she can attract a man like Kostya, who has a young and beautiful new wife, but can no longer attract Vronsky. Her relationship with Vronsky is under increasing strain, because he can move freely in Russian society while she remains excluded. Her increasing bitterness, boredom, and jealousy cause the couple to argue.

Anna begins to abuse morphine to help her sleep, a habit she began while living with Vronsky at his country estate, and becomesaddictedto thenarcotic. Meanwhile, after a long and difficult labour, Kitty gives birth to a son, Dmitri, who goes by the nickname Mitya and Kostya is paradoxically both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny baby.

Stiva visits Karenin to seek his commendation for a new post. During the visit, Stiva asks Karenin to grant Anna a divorce with her as the innocent party (which would require him to confess to a non-existent affair), but Karenin's decisions are now governed by a Frenchclairvoyantrecommended by Lidia Ivanovna. The clairvoyant apparently had a vision in his sleep during Stiva's visit and gives Karenin a cryptic message that he interprets in a way such that he must decline the request for divorce.

Anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards Vronsky, whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women. She is also convinced that he will give in to his mother's plans to marry him off to a rich society woman. They have a bitter row and Anna believes the relationship is over. She starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments. In her mental and emotional confusion, she sends a telegram to Vronsky asking him to come home to her, and then pays a visit to Dolly and Kitty. Anna's confusion and anger overcome her and, in conscious symmetry with the railway worker's death on her first meeting with Vronsky, from ground level at the end of a railway platform, shecommits suicideby throwing herself under a passing freight train.

Sergei Ivanovich's (Kostya's brother) latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he participates in the Russian commitment toPan-Slavism. Stiva gets the post he desired so much, and Karenin takes custody of Vronsky and Anna's baby, Annie. A group of Russian volunteers, including the suicidal Vronsky, depart from Russia to fight in the Orthodox Serbian revolt that has broken out against theTurks, more broadly identified as theRusso-Turkish War (1877–1878).

Kostya struggles to find the meaning of his life after his brother Nikolai's death from consumption, and begins to have suicidal thoughts. However, after speaking at length to a peasant, Kostya has a true change of heart, concluding that the meaning of life is to serve God, and that he does believe in the Christian principles taught to him in childhood and no longer questions his faith. He realizes that one must decide for oneself what is acceptable concerning one's own faith and beliefs and chooses not to tell Kitty of the change that he has undergone.

A lightning storm later occurs at Kostya's estate while his wife and newborn son are outdoors and, in his fear for their safety, Kostya realizes that he does indeed love his son as much as he loves Kitty. Kitty's family is concerned that a man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be a Christian.

Kostya is initially displeased that his return to his faith does not bring with it a complete transformation to righteousness. However, at the end of the story, Kostya arrives at the conclusion that despite his newly accepted beliefs, he is human and will go on making mistakes. His life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward righteousness.

Tolstoy's style inAnna Kareninais considered by many critics to be transitional, forming a bridge between therealistandmodernistnovel.[7]According to Ruth Benson in her book about Tolstoy's heroines, Tolstoy's diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts ofAnna Karenina, quoting him as stating, ""I loathe what I have written. The galleys ofAnna Kareninafor the April issue ofRusskij Vestniknow lie on my table, and I really don't have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten—all that has been printed too—scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced (1876, JI 62: 265)"".[8]

Anna Kareninais commonly thought to explore the themes of hypocrisy, jealousy, faith, fidelity, family, marriage, society, progress, carnal desire and passion, and the agrarian connection to land in contrast to the lifestyles of the city.[9]According to literary theorist Cornelius Quassus, in the novelAnna Karenina, ""unofficial institutions of the system, presented through social salons, function as part of the power apparatus that successfully calms the disorder created by Anna's irrational emotional action, which is a symbol of resistance to the system of social behavioral control.""[10]TranslatorRosemary Edmondswrote that Tolstoy does not explicitly moralize in the book, but instead allows his themes to emerge naturally from the ""vast panorama of Russian life."" She also says one of the novel's key messages is that ""no one may build their happiness on another's pain.""[11]

Levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Tolstoy's own beliefs, struggles, and life events.[11]Tolstoy's first name was ""Lev"", and the Russian surname ""Levin"" means ""of Lev"". According to footnotes in the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation, the viewpoints Levin supports throughout the novel in his arguments match Tolstoy's outspoken views on the same issues. Moreover, according to W. Gareth Jones, Levin proposed to Kitty in the same way as Tolstoy toSophia Behrs. Additionally, Levin's request that his fiancée read his diary as a way of disclosing his faults and previous sexual encounters parallels Tolstoy's own requests to his fiancée Behrs.[12]

The events in the novel take place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by EmperorAlexander II of Russia, principal among these theemancipation reform of 1861, followed by judicial reform, including a jury system; military reforms, the introduction of elected local governments (zemstvos), the fast development of railroads, banks, industry,telegraphy, the rise of new business elites and the decline of the old landed aristocracy, a freer press, the awakening of public opinion, thePan-Slavismmovement,the woman question, volunteering to aidSerbiain its military conflict with theOttoman Empirein 1876, etc. These contemporary developments are hotly debated by the characters in the novel.[13]

The suburban railway station of Obiralovka, where one of the characters commits suicide, is now known as the town ofZheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast.

Anna Karenina's immediate reception in the United States was mixed, with the work's themes and eponymous character receiving praise but its length and depiction of suicide receiving criticism.[14]

WhenWilliam Faulknerwas asked to list what he thought were the three greatest novels, he replied: ""Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina, andAnna Karenina"".[15]

Writing in the year 2000, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit compared the different translations ofAnna Kareninaon the market. Commenting on the revision of Constance Garnett's 1901 translation she says: ""The revision (1965) ... by Kent & Berberova (the latter no mean stylist herself) succeeds in 'correcting errors ... tightening the prose, converting Briticisms, and casting light on areas Mrs Garnett did not explore'. Their edition shows an excellent understanding of the details of Tolstoy's world (for instance, the fact that the elaborate coiffure Kitty wears to the ball is not her own hair—a detail that eludes most other translators), and at the same time they use English imaginatively (Kitty's shoes 'delighted her feet' rather than 'seemed to make her feet lighter'—Maude; a paraphrase). ... the purist will be pleased to see Kent & Berberova give all the Russian names in full, as used by the author; any reader will be grateful for the footnotes that elucidate anything not immediately accessible to someone not well acquainted with imperial Russia. This emended Garnett should probably be a reader's first choice.""

She further comments on the Maudes' translation: ""the revised Garnett and the Magarshack versions do better justice to the original, but still, the World's Classics edition (1995) ... offers a very full List of Characters ... and good notes based on the Maudes'."" On Edmonds's translation she states: ""[it] has the advantage of solid scholarship ... Yet she lacks a true sensitivity for the language ... [leading] to [her] missing many a subtlety."" On Carmichael's version she comments: ""this is a—rather breezily—readable translation ... but there are errors and misunderstandings, as well as clumsiness."" On Magarshack's translation she comments: ""[it] offers natural, simple, and direct English prose that is appropriate to Tolstoy's Russian. There is occasional awkwardness ... and imprecision ... but Magarshack understands the text ... and even when unable to translate an idiom closely he renders its real meaning ... This is a good translation."" On Wettlin'sSovietversion she writes: ""steady but uninspired, and sounds like English prose written by a Russian who knows the language but is not completely at home in it. The advantage is that Wettlin misses hardly any cultural detail.""[17]

InIn Quest Of Tolstoy(2008), Hughes McLean devotes a full chapter (""Which EnglishAnna?"") comparing different translations ofAnna Karenina.[18]His conclusion, after comparing seven translations, is that ""the PV [Pevear and Volokhonsky] translation, while perfectly adequate, is in my view not consistently or unequivocally superior to others in the market.""[19]He states his recommendations in the last two pages of the survey: ""Noneof the existing translations is activelybad... One's choice ... must therefore be based on nuances, subtleties, and refinements.""[20]He eliminates the Maudes for ""disturbing errors"" and ""did not find either the Margashack or Carmichael ever superior to the others, and the lack of notes is a drawback."" On Edmonds's version he states: ""her version has no notes at all and all too frequently errs in the direction of making Tolstoy's 'robust awkwardness' conform to the translator's notion of good English style.""[21]

McLean's recommendations are the Kent–Berberova revision of Garnett's translation and the Pevear and Volokhonsky version. ""I consider the GKB [Garnett–Kent–Berberova] a very good version, even though it is based on an out-of-date Russian text. Kent and Berberova did a much more thorough and careful revision of Garnett's translation than Gibian did of the Maude one, and they have supplied fairly full notes, conveniently printed at the bottom of the page.""[22]McLean takes Pevear and Volokhonsky to task for not using the best critical text (the ""Zaidenshnur–Zhdanov text"") and offering flawed notes without consulting C.J. Turner'sA Karenina Companion(1993), although he calls their version ""certainly a good translation.""[22]

Reviewing the translations by Bartlett and Schwartz forThe New York Times Book Review,Masha Gessennoted that each new translation ofAnna Kareninaended up highlighting an aspect of Tolstoy's ""variable voice"" in the novel, and thus, ""The Tolstoy of Garnett... is a monocled British gentleman who is simply incapable of taking his characters as seriously as they take themselves. Pevear and Volokhonsky... created a reasonable, calm storyteller who communicated in conversational American English. Rosamund Bartlett... creates an updated ironic-Brit version of Tolstoy. Marian Schwartz... has produced what is probably the least smooth-talking and most contradictory Tolstoy yet."" Gessen found Schwartz's translation to be formally closer to the original Russian, but often weighed down with details as a result; Bartlett's translation, like Pevear and Volokhonsky's, was rendered in more idiomatic English and more readable.[23]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/829,Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels,"The travel begins with a short preamble in whichLemuel Gullivergives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall, much like thelittle people in mythology, who are inhabitants of the island country ofLilliput. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput Royal Court. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on the condition that he must not hurt their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver aids the Lilliputians against the rival island nation of Blefuscu by stealing its entire naval fleet. However, he refuses to reduce Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, ""a considerable person at court"", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home with some Lilliputian animals he carries with him.

Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing shipAdventureis blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the North American continent.

The grass ofBrobdingnagis as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72 ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being 10 yards (9 m). Thegiantfarmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter Glumdalclitch cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the queen's service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his ""travelling box"".

Between small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the roof by a monkey, he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The king is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannon. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10676,The Reign of Greed,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_filibusterismo,"In the events ofthe previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, areform-mindedmestizowho tried to establish a modern school in his hometown of San Diego and marry his childhoodsweetheart, was falsely accused of rebellion and presumed dead after a shootout following his escape from prison. Elías, his friend who was also a reformer, sacrificed his life to give Crisóstomo a chance to regain his treasure and flee the country, and hopefully continue their crusade for reforms from abroad. After a thirteen-year absence from thecountry, a more revolutionary Crisóstomo has returned, having taken the identity of Simoun, a mysterious wealthy jeweler whose objective is to drive the government to commit as much abuse as possible in order todrive people into revolution.

Simoun goes from town to town presumably to sell his jewels. Reaching San Diego, he detours to  the Ibarras' forested land to retrieve more of his treasures buried in the mausoleum. There, his true identity as Crisóstomo Ibarra is discovered by a now-grown Basilio, who was also in the mausoleum visiting his mother's grave. In the years since the death of his mother, Basilio had been serving as Capitán Tiago's servant in exchange for being allowed to study, and is now an aspiring doctor on his last year atuniversityas well as administrator and apparent heir to Capitán Tiago's wealth. Simoun reveals his motives to Basilio and offers him a place in his plans. Too secure of his place in the world, Basilio declines.

At Barrio Sagpang in the town of Tiani, Simoun stays at the house of the village'scabeza de barangay, Tales. Having suffered misfortune after misfortune in recent years, Kabesang Tales is unable to resist the temptation to steal Simoun's revolver and join the bandits. InLos Baños, Simoun joins his friend, the Captain-General, who is then taking a break from a hunting excursion. In a friendly game of cards with him and his cronies, Simoun raises the stakes higher and higher and half-jokingly secures blank orders for deportation, imprisonment, andsummary executionfrom the Captain-General.

Later on, Simoun goes to Manila and meets Quiroga,[2]a wealthy Chinese businessman and aspiring consul-general for theQing dynasty. Knowing Quiroga is heavily in his debt, Simoun offers him a steep discount if the former stores his massive arsenal of rifles in Quiroga's warehouses, to be used presumably for extortion activities with Manila's elite. Despite his hatred of guns and weaponry, Quiroga reluctantly agrees to do the job and uses his bazaar as a front.

During theQuiapoFair, a talking heads[3]exhibit[4]ostensibly organized by an American named Mr. Leeds but secretly commissioned by Simoun is drawing popular acclaim. Padre Bernardo Salví, now chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares,[5]attends one of the performances. The exhibit is set inPtolemaic Egyptbut features a tale that closely resembled that of Crisóstomo Ibarra and María Clara, and their fate under Salví. The show ends with an ominous vow of revenge. Deeply overcome with guilt and fear, Salví recommends the show be banned, but not before Mr. Leeds sailed for Hong Kong.

Months pass and the night of Simoun's revolution comes. Simoun visits Basilio in Tiago's house and tries to convince him again to join his revolution. He reveals his plan for the attack: a cannon volley shall be fired, at which point Kabesang Tales, now a bandit identifying himself as Matanglawin, and Simoun, who managed to deceive and recruit a sizable rogue force among the government troops, will lead their forces into the city. The leaders of the Church, the University, scores of bureaucrats, the Captain-General himself, as well as the bulk of officers guarding them are all conveniently located in one place, the theater where a controversial and much-hyped performance ofLes cloches de Corneville[6]is taking place. While Simoun and Matanglawin direct their forces, Basilio and several others are to raid the Convent of the Poor Clares and rescue María Clara.

However, Basilio reports to Simoun that María Clara died just that afternoon, after suffering the travails of monastic life under Salví, who always lusted after her. Simoun, driven by grief, aborts the attack and becomes crestfallen throughout the night. It will be reported later on that he suffered an ""accident"" that night, leaving him confined to his bed.

The following day, posters threatening violence to the leaders of the university and the government are found at the university doors. A reform-oriented student group to which Basilio belonged is named the primary suspects; the members are arrested, including Basilio, despite his absence from the group's mock dinner the night before. They are eventually freed through the intercession of relatives, except for Basilio who is an orphan and has no means to pay for his freedom. During his imprisonment, he learns that Capitán Tiago has died, leaving him with nothing; it is revealed that Tiago's will was actually forged by his spiritual advisor Padre Írene, who also supplied him with opium; his childhood sweetheart Juli has committed suicide to avoid getting raped by parish priest Camorra when she tried asking for help on Basilio's behalf; and that he has missed his graduation and will be required to study for another year, but now with no funds to go by. Released through the intercession of Simoun, a darkened, disillusioned Basilio joins Simoun's cause wholeheartedly.

Simoun, meanwhile, has been organizing a new revolution, and he reveals his plans to a now committed Basilio. The wedding of Juanito Peláez and Paulita Gómez will be used to coordinate the attack upon the city. As the Peláez and Gómez families are prominent members of the Manila elite, leaders of the church and civil government are invited to the reception. The Captain-General, who declined to extend his tenure despite Simoun's urging, is leaving in two days and is the guest of honor.

Simoun will personally deliver a pomegranate-shaped crystal lamp as a wedding gift. The lamp is to be placed on a plinth at the reception venue and will be bright enough to illuminate the entire hall, which was also walled with mirrors. After some time the light will flicker as if to go out. When someone attempts to raise the wick, a mechanism hidden within the lamp containingfulminated mercurywill detonate, igniting the lamp which is actually filled withnitroglycerin, killing everyone in an enormous blast.

At the sound of the explosion, Simoun's mercenaries will attack, reinforced by Matanglawin and his bandits who will descend upon the city from the surrounding hills. Simoun postulates that in the chaos, the masses, already worked to a panic by the government's heavy-handed response to the poster incident, as well as rumors of German ships in thebayto lend their firepower to any uprising against the Spanish government, will step out in desperation to kill or be killed. Basilio and a few others are to put themselves at their head and lead them to Quiroga's warehouses, where Simoun's guns are still being kept. The plan thus finalized, Simoun gives Basilio a loaded revolver and sends him away to await further instructions.

Basilio walks the streets for hours and passes by his old home, Capitán Tiago's riverside house onAnloague Street. He discovers that this was to be the reception venue – Juanito Peláez's father bought Tiago's house as a gift for the newlywed couple. Sometime later, he sees Simoun enter the house with the lamp, then hastily exit the house and board his carriage. Basilio begins to move away but sees Isagani, his friend and Paulita Gómez's former lover, sadly looking at Paulita through the window. Noting how close they were to the condemned house, Basilio tries to head Isagani off, but Isagani was too dazed with grief to listen to him. In desperation, Basilio reveals to Isagani how the house is set to explode at any time then. But when Isagani still refuses to heed him, Basilio flees, leaving Isagani to his fate.

Seeing Basilio's demeanor, Isagani is belatedly unnerved by the revelation. Isagani rushes into the house, seizes the lamp, and throws it into the river. With this, Simoun's second revolution fails as well.

In the following days, as the trappings at the reception venue are torn down, sacks containing gunpowder are discovered hidden under the boards all over the house. Simoun, who had directed the renovations, is exposed. With the Captain-General having left for Spain, Simoun is left without his protector and is forced to flee. A manhunt ensues and Simoun is chased as far away as theshoresof the Pacific. He then spends the rest of his days hiding in the ancestral mansion of Padre Florentino, Isagani's uncle.

One day, the lieutenant of the local Guardia Civil informs Florentino that he received an order to arrest Simoun that night. In response, Simoun drinks the slow-acting poison which he always kept in a compartment in his treasure chest. Simoun then makes his final confession to Florentino, first revealing his true name, to Florentino's shock. He goes on to narrate how thirteen years before, as Crisóstomo Ibarra, he lost everything in the Philippines despite his good intentions. Crisóstomo swore vengeance. Retrieving some of his family's treasure that Elias had buried in the Ibarra mausoleum in the forest, Crisóstomo fled to foreign lands and engaged in trade. He took part in thewar in Cuba, aiding first one side and then another, but always profiting. There Crisóstomo met the Captain-General who was then a major, whose goodwill he won first by loans of money, and afterwards by covering his criminal activity. Crisóstomo bribed his way to secure the major's promotion to Captain-General and his assignment to the Philippines. Once in the country, Crisóstomo then used him as a blind tool and incited him to all kinds of injustice, taking advantage of the Captain-General's insatiable lust for gold.

The confession is long and arduous, and night has fallen when Crisóstomo finishes. In the end, Florentino assures the dying man of God's mercy, but explains that his revolution failed because he has chosen means that God cannot sanction. Crisóstomo bitterly accepts the explanation and dies.

Realizing that the arresting officers will confiscate Crisóstomo's possessions, Florentino divests him of his jewels and casts them into the sea, proclaiming that they are best hidden under the waters for the time being to ensure that they cannot be used to distort justice or incite greed, and that God shall provide the means to draw them out should people need wealth for a righteous cause.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158,Emma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(novel),"Emma Woodhouse's friend and former governess, Miss Taylor, has just married Mr. Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage and decides that she likesmatchmaking. After returning home to Hartfield, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of her friend Mr. Knightley, whose brother is married to Emma's elder sister, Isabella. She attempts to match her new friend, Harriet Smith, to Mr. Elton, the localvicar. Emma persuades Harriet to refuse a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable young farmer, although Harriet likes him. Mr. Elton, a social climber, mistakenly believes Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma reveals she believed him attached to Harriet, he is outraged, considering Harriet socially inferior. After Emma rejects him, Mr. Elton goes toBathand returns with a pretentious,nouveau-richewife, as Mr. Knightley expected he would do. Harriet is heartbroken, and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her.

Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son, arrives for a two-week visit. Frank was adopted by his wealthy and domineering aunt and has had few opportunities to visit before. Mr. Knightley tells Emma that, while Frank is intelligent and engaging, he has a shallow character. Jane Fairfax also arrives to visit her aunt Miss Bates and grandmother Mrs. Bates for a few months before starting a governess position due to financial situation. She is the same age as Emma and has received an excellent education through her father's friend, Colonel Campbell. Emma has remained somewhat aloof from Jane because she envies her and is annoyed by everyone, including Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, praising Jane. Mrs. Elton takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find a governess post before it is wanted.

Emma decides that Jane and Mr. Dixon, Colonel Campbell's new son-in-law, are mutually attracted, and that is the reason she arrived earlier than expected. She confides this to Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells atWeymouththe previous year; he apparently agrees with Emma. Suspicions are further fuelled when a gifted piano, sent anonymously, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last. The Eltons treat Harriet poorly, culminating in Mr. Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at a ball. Mr. Knightley, who normally refrained from dancing, gallantly asks Harriet to dance. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, as she fainted after a rough encounter with localgypsies. Emma mistakes Harriet's gratitude to Frank as Harriet being in love with him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston wonders if Mr. Knightley is attracted to Jane, but Emma dismisses the idea. When Mr. Knightley says he notices a connection between Jane and Frank, Emma disagrees, as Frank appears to be courting her instead. Frank arrives late to a gathering at Donwell, while Jane departs early. The next day atBox Hill, a local scenic spot, Frank and Emma are joking when Emma thoughtlessly insults Miss Bates.

When Mr. Knightley scolds Emma for insulting Miss Bates, she is ashamed. The next day, she visits Miss Bates to atone for her bad behaviour, impressing Mr. Knightley. During the visit, Emma learns that Jane has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs. Elton's friends. Jane becomes ill and refuses to see Emma or receive her gifts. Meanwhile, Frank has been visiting his aunt, who dies soon after his arrival. He and Jane reveal to the Westons that they have been secretly engaged since autumn, but Frank knew his aunt would disapprove of the match. Maintaining the secrecy strained the conscientious Jane and caused the couple to quarrel, with Jane ending the engagement. Frank's easygoing uncle readily gives his blessing to the match. The engagement is made public, leaving Emma annoyed to discover that she had been so wrong.

Emma believes Frank's engagement will devastate Harriet, but instead, Harriet says she loves Mr. Knightley, and though she knows the match is too unequal, Emma's encouragement and Mr. Knightley's kindness have given her hope. Emma is startled and realises that she is also in love with Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley returns to console Emma about Frank and Jane's engagement, thinking her heartbroken. When she admits her foolishness, he proposes, and she accepts. Harriet accepts Robert Martin's second proposal, and they are the first couple to marry. Jane and Emma reconcile, and Frank and Jane visit the Westons. Once the mourning period for Frank's aunt ends, they will marry. Before the end of November, Emma and Mr. Knightley are married with the prospect of ""perfect happiness.""

Emma Woodhouse, the protagonist of the story, is a beautiful, high-spirited, intelligent, and somewhat spoiled young woman from thelanded gentry. She is twenty when the story opens. Her mother died when she was young. She has been mistress of the house (Hartfield) since her older sister got married. Although intelligent, she lacks the discipline to practise or study anything in depth. She is portrayed as compassionate to the poor, but at the same time has a strong sense of class status. Her affection for and patience towards her valetudinarian father are also noteworthy. While she is in many ways mature, Emma makes some serious mistakes, mainly due to her lack of experience and her conviction that she is always right. Although she has vowed she will never marry, she delights in making matches for others. She has a brief flirtation with Frank Churchill; however, she realises at the end of the novel that she loves Mr Knightley.

Mr Knightley, aged 37 years, is Emma's neighbour and close friend. He is her only critic. Mr Knightley owns Donwell Abbey, which includes extensive grounds and farms. He is the elder brother of Mr John Knightley, the husband of Emma's elder sister Isabella. Mr Knightly is considerate, aware of the feelings of the other characters, and always exhibits good behaviour and judgment. Mr Knightley is angry after Emma persuades Harriet to turn down Mr Martin, a farmer on the Donwell estate; he warns Emma against pushing Harriet towards Mr Elton, knowing that Mr Elton seeks to marry for money. He is suspicious of Frank Churchill and his motives; he suspects that Frank has a secret understanding with Jane Fairfax.

Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son by his first marriage, is an amiable young man, who, at age 23, is liked by almost everyone. Mr Knightley, however, thinks him immature and selfish for failing to visit his father after his father's wedding. After his mother's death, he was raised by his wealthy aunt and uncle, the Churchills, at the family estate of Enscombe in Yorkshire. His uncle was his mother's brother. By his aunt's decree, he assumed the name Churchill on his majority. Frank is given to dancing and living a carefree existence, and is secretly engaged to Miss Fairfax atWeymouth, although he fears his aunt will forbid the match because Jane is not wealthy. He manipulates and plays games with the other characters to ensure his engagement to Jane remains concealed.

Jane Fairfaxis an orphan whose only family is her aunt, Miss Bates, and her grandmother, Mrs Bates. She is a beautiful, bright, and elegant woman, with impeccable manners. She is the same age as Emma. She is well-educated and talented at singing and playing the piano; she is the only person whom Emma envies. Colonel Campbell, an army friend of Jane's father, felt responsible for Jane, and provided her an excellent education while she has shared his home and family since she was nine years old. She has little fortune, however, and is destined to become a governess – an unpleasant prospect. The secret engagement goes against her principles and distresses her greatly.

Harriet Smith, a young friend of Emma, just seventeen when the story opens, is a beautiful but unsophisticated girl. She has been a pupil at a nearby school, where she met the sisters of Mr Martin. As a parlour boarder at the school she now helps supervise younger pupils. Emma takes Harriet under her wing early on, and she becomes the subject of Emma's misguided matchmaking attempts. She is revealed in the last chapter to be the natural daughter of a decent tradesman, although he is not a gentleman. Harriet and Mr Martin are wed. The now wiser Emma approves of the match.

Robert Martinis a well-to-do, 24-year-old tenant farmer who, though not a gentleman, is a friendly, amiable and diligent young man, well esteemed by Mr George Knightley. He becomes acquainted and subsequently smitten with Harriet during her 2-month stay at Abbey Mill Farm, which was arranged at the invitation of his sister, Elizabeth Martin, Harriet's school friend. His first marriage proposal, in a letter, is rejected by Harriet under Emma's direction and influence (an incident which puts Mr Knightley and Emma in a disagreement with one another). Emma had convinced herself that Harriet's class and breeding were above associating with the Martins, much less marrying one. His second marriage proposal is later accepted by a contented Harriet and approved by a wiser Emma; their joining marks the first of the three happy couples to marry in the end.

Reverend Philip Eltonis a good-looking, initially well-mannered, and ambitious young vicar, 27 years old and unmarried when the story opens. He is well aware of his good looks and status, and it is only when he is around men that he shows his true colours and reveals his schemes to marry a wealthy woman. Emma wants him to marry Harriet; however, he aspires to secure Emma's hand in marriage to gain her dowry of £30,000. Mr Elton displays his mercenary nature by quickly marrying another woman of means after Emma rejects him.

Augusta Elton, formerly Miss Hawkins, is Mr Elton's wife. She has 10,000 pounds ""or thereabouts"" (the vague description of her dowry perhaps suggests she is not as wealthy as she claims), but lacks good manners, committing common vulgarities such as using people's names too intimately (as in ""Jane"", not ""Miss Fairfax""; ""Knightley"", not ""Mr Knightley""). She is a boasting, pretentious woman who expects her due as a new bride in the village. Emma is polite to her but does not like her and the two instantly become passive-aggressive enemies. She patronises Jane, which earns Jane the sympathy of others. Her lack of social graces shows the good breeding of the other characters, particularly Miss Fairfax and Mrs Weston, and shows the difference between gentility and money. Mrs Elton repeatedly makes contradictory and unbelievable declarations about her background, such as exaggerated claims of the similarity between Emma's estate, Hartfield, and her brother-in-law's manor, Maple Grove, revealing her dishonesty and enforcing the idea that she is a schemingparvenutrying her utmost to conceal her lower origins.

Mrs Westonwas Emma's governess for sixteen years as Miss Anne Taylor and remains her closest friend and confidante after she marries Mr Weston. She is a sensible woman who loves Emma. Mrs Weston acts as a surrogate mother to her former charge and, occasionally, as a voice of moderation and reason. The Weston and the Woodhouse families see each other almost daily. Near the end of the story, the Westons' baby Anna is born.

Mr Westonis a widower and a businessman living in Highbury who marries Miss Taylor in his early 40s, after buying a house called Randalls. By his first marriage, he is father to Frank Weston Churchill, who was adopted and raised by his late wife's brother and his wife. He sees his son in London each year. He married his first wife, Miss Churchill, when he was a captain in the militia, posted near her home. Mr Weston is a sanguine, optimistic man, who enjoys socialising, making friends quickly in business and among his neighbours.

Miss Batesis a friendly, garrulous spinster whose mother, Mrs Bates, is a friend of Mr Woodhouse. Her niece is Jane Fairfax, daughter of her late sister. She was raised in better circumstances in her younger days as the vicar's daughter; now she and her mother rent rooms in Highbury. One day, Emma humiliates her on a day out in the country, when she alludes to her tiresome prolixity.

Mr Henry Woodhouse, Emma's father, is always concerned for his health, and to the extent that it does not interfere with his own, the health and comfort of his friends. He is a valetudinarian (i.e., similar to a hypochondriac but more likely to be genuinely ill). He assumes that a great many things are hazardous to his health, especially draughts of wind. Emma gets along with him well, and he loves both his daughters. He laments that ""poor Isabella"" and especially ""poor Miss Taylor"" have married and live away from him. He is a fond father and fond grandfather who did not remarry when his wife died; instead he brought in Miss Taylor to educate his daughters and become part of the family. Because he is generous and well-mannered, his neighbours accommodate him when they can.

Isabella Knightley (née Woodhouse)is the elder sister of Emma, by seven years, and daughter of Henry. She is married to John Knightley. She lives in London with her husband and their five children (Henry, 'little' John, Bella, 'little' Emma, and George). She is similar in disposition to her father, and her relationship to Mr Wingfield, (her family's physician) mirrors that of her father's to Mr Perry.

John Knightleyis Isabella's husband and George's younger brother, 31 years old. He is a lawyer (either a barrister or solicitor) by profession. Like the others raised in the area, he is a friend of Jane Fairfax. He greatly enjoys the company of his family, including his brother and his Woodhouse in-laws, but is not a very sociable man. He is forthright with Emma, his sister-in-law.

Mr Perryis the apothecary in Highbury. He is never shown directly speaking but spends a significant amount of time responding to the health issues of Mr Woodhouse. He and Mrs Perry have several children. He is also the subject of a discussion between Miss Bates and Jane Fairfax that is relayed in a letter to Mr Frank Churchill which he inadvertently discloses to Emma, thus risking discovery of his link with Jane Fairfax. He is described as an ""...intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse's life.[6]""

Mrs Batesis the widow of the former vicar of Highbury, the mother of Miss Bates and the grandmother of Jane Fairfax. She is old and hard of hearing, but is a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse when Emma attends social activities without him.

Mr & Mrs Colehave been residents of Highbury for several years, but have recently benefited from a significant increase in their income that has allowed them to expand the size of their house, number of servants and other expenses. Despite their ""low origin"" in trade, their income and style of living have made them the second most prominent family in Highbury, next to the Woodhouses at Hartfield. They host a dinner party that is a significant plot element.

Mrs Churchillwas the wife of the brother of Mr Weston's first wife. She and her husband, Mr Churchill, live at Enscombe in Yorkshire and raised Mr Weston's son, Mr Frank Churchill after the death of Frank's mother. Although never seen directly, she makes demands on Frank Churchill's time and attention that prevent him from visiting his father. Her potential disapproval is the reason that the engagement between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is kept secret. Her death provides the opportunity for the secret to be revealed.

Colonel and Mrs Campbellwere friends of Jane Fairfax's late father. Since Jane was their guest for extended visits, they took over her education in preparation for her working as a governess when she grew up. They provided her every advantage possible, short of adoption, and were very fond of her.

Mrs Goddardis the mistress of a boarding school for girls in which Harriet Smith is one of the pupils. She is also a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse along with Mrs Bates.

Mr William Larkinsis an employee on the Donwell Abbey estate of Mr Knightley. He frequently visits the Bateses, bringing them gifts, such as apples, from Mr Knightley.

Emmawas written after the publication ofPride and Prejudiceand was submitted to the London publisherJohn Murray IIin the autumn of 1815.  He offered Austen £450 for this plus the copyrights ofMansfield ParkandSense and Sensibility, which she refused.  Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray.  The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set induodecimoat the selling price of £1.1s (oneguinea) per set.[7]

Prior to publication, Austen's novels had come to the attention of thePrince Regent, whose librarian at Carlton House, aMr Clarke, showed her around the Library at the Prince Regent's request, and who suggested a dedication to the Prince Regent in a future publication.  This resulted in a dedication ofEmmato the Prince Regent at the time of publication and a dedication copy of the novel sent to Carlton House in December 1815.[8]

In America, copies of this first publication were sold in 1818 for $4 per copy, as well as an American edition published byMathew Careyof Philadelphia in 1816.  The number of copies of this edition are not known.  A later American edition was published in 1833[9]and again in 1838 by Carey, Lea, and Blanchard.[10]A French version was published in 1816 by Arthus Bertrand, publisher for MadameIsabelle De Montolieu.[11]A second French version for the Austrian market was published in 1817 Viennese publisher Schrambl.[12]

Richard BentleyreissuedEmmain 1833, along with Austen's five other novels, in his series of Standard Novels. This issue did not contain the dedication page to the Prince Regent.[13]These editions were frequently reprinted up until 1882 with the final publication of the Steventon Edition.[14]Emmahas remained in continuous publication in English throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In addition to the French translation already mentioned,Emmawas translated into Swedish and German in the nineteenth century and into fifteen other languages in the twentieth century including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German and Italian.[15]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31284,Josefine Mutzenbacher (German),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Mutzenbacher,"The publisher's preface – formatted as anobituaryand excluded from all English translations until 2018 – tells that Josefine left the manuscript to her physician before her death from complications after a surgery. Josefine Mutzenbacher was not her real name. The protagonist is said to have been born on 20 February 1852 in Vienna and died on 17 December 1904 at a sanatorium.[17]

The plot device employed inJosephine Mutzenbacheris that offirst-person narrative, structured in the format of amemoir. The story is told from the point of view of an accomplished aging 50-year-old Viennesecourtesanwho is looking back upon the sexual escapades she enjoyed during her unbridled youth in Vienna. Contrary to the title, almost the entirety of the book takes place when Josephine is between the ages of 5–13 years old, before she actually becomes a licensed prostitute in the brothels of Vienna. The book begins when she is five years old and ends when she is thirteen years old and starts her career as an unlicensed prostitute with a friend, to support her unemployed father.

Although the German-language text makes use of witty nicknames – for instance, thecurate's genital is called ""a hammer of mercy"" – for human anatomy and sexual behavior, its content is entirely pornographic. The actual progression of events amounts to little more than a graphic, unapologetic description of the reckless sexuality exhibited by the heroine, all before reaching her 14th year. The style bears more than a passing resemblance to theMarquis de Sade'sThe 120 Days of Sodomin its unabashed ""laundry list"" cataloging of all manner of taboo sexual antics from children's sexual play,incestand rape to child prostitution,group sex,sado-masochism,lesbianism, andfellatio. In some constellations, Josefine appears as the active seducer, and sex is usually depicted as an uncomplicated, satisfactory experience.[18]

The original Austrian publication was unillustrated, but a later pirated edition from 1922 contained black-and-white drawings, entirely pornographic as the text. These illustrations were bound in the archival copy of the first edition at theAustrian National Library,[19]and have been reproduced at least in the hardcover edition of the 2018 English translation[20]and in a 2019 Finnish translation,[21]erroneously dated to 1906. Another illustrated German-language edition was published in the late 1960s inLiechtensteinwith images by Jean Veenenbos (1932–2005).

Other illustrations have been created as well. The first English translation of 1931 was quickly pirated in New York and illustrated byMahlon Blaine(1894–1969). The 1973 translation,Oh! Oh! Josephine, is illustrated with photographic stills from ""the continental movie"" of 1970,Josephine Mutzenbachera.k.a.Naughty KnickersbyKurt Nachmann.

Also aDanishtranslation of 1967 contains illustrations. An incompleteSwedishtranslation from 1983 contains random photographs of prostitutes with scathing comments.[15]

The novelJosefine Mutzenbacherhas given rise to a multitude of interpretations. It has been listed both as child pornography and labeled as an apposite depiction of the milieu and manners of its time in Vienna, a travesty or a parody or apersiflageof a coming-of-age story or a novel of development,[22]and mentioned as a rare case of apicaresque novelwith a female protagonist.[23]It has also been praised for its criticism of the bourgeois society.[24]

The relation of the novel to theFreudiantheory of sexualityhas been subject to debate. The Swedish translatorC.-M. EdenborgseesJosefine Mutzenbacheras an indictment of Freud's bourgeois psychology,[25]whereas the Austrian psychoanalyst Désirée Prosquill thinks that not only are there marked thematic correspondences betweenJosefine Mutzenbacher(1906) andThree Essays on the Theory of Sexuality(1905) butMutzenbacheralso anticipates some issues concerning infantile sexuality that Freud added to his theory only later.[26]

The distribution of the novelJosefine Mutzenbacherwas forbidden in Austria from 1913 on when it was taken into the listCatalogus Librorum in Austria Prohibitorumbecause of itsobscenity.[27]

In 1931, a bookseller called Josef Kunz was convicted in Vienna for a public act of obscenity because he had published a new edition of the novel, and the copies of the book were confiscated.[28]In 1971, however, theSupreme Court of Austriadecided that there is no longer reason to punish a publisher for distributing the novel because there are artistic tendencies in the work. Still in 1988, there was another legal process to ban the novel because of obscenity, but this time, too, the Supreme Court judged in favour of the publisher.[29]

The Mutzenbacher Decision (Case BVerfGE 83,130[30]) was a ruling of theFederal Constitutional Courtof Germany (Bundesverfassungsgericht) on 27 November 1990 concerning whether or not the novelJosefine Mutzenbachershould be placed on a list of youth-restricted media. However, the significance of the case came to eclipseJosefine Mutzenbacheras an individual work, because it set a precedent as to which has a larger weight in German Law: Freedom of Expression or The Protection of Youth.

The final decision was made in 1992 at the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), putting the work once again on the list of ""Media harming the youth"" (Jungendgefährdenden Medien) forcing the right of Freedom of Expression (Under Article 5 III Fundamental rights) to step back.

""Pornography and art are not mutually exclusive.""

In Germany, there is a process known asindexing(German:Indizierung). TheBundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien(BPjMor ""Federal inspection department for youth-endangering media"") collates books, movies, video games and music that could be harmful to young people because they contain violence, pornography,Nazism,hate speechand similar dangerous content. The items are placed on the ""List of youth-endangering media"" (Liste jugendgefährdender Medien).

An item will stay on the list for 25 years, after which time the effects of the indexing will cease automatically.[31]

Items that are indexed (placed on the list) cannot be bought by anyone under 18, they are not allowed to be sold at regular bookstores or retailers that young people have access to, nor are they allowed to be advertised in any manner.[32]An item that is placed on the list becomes very difficult for adults to access as a result of these restrictions.

The issue underlying the Mutzenbacher Decision is not whether the book is legal for adults to buy, own, read, and sell – that is not disputed. The case concerns whether the intrinsic merit of the book as a work of art supersedes the potential harm its controversial contents could have on the impressionable minds of minors and whether or not it should be ""indexed"".

In the 1960s, two separate publishing houses made new editions of the original 1906Josefine Mutzenbacher. In 1965 Dehli Publishers ofCopenhagen,Denmark, published a two volume edition, and in 1969 the German publisher Rogner & Bernhard inMunichprinted another edition with a glossary byOswald Wiener. The BPjM placedJosefine Mutzenbacheron its list, after two criminal courts declared the pornographic content of the book obscene.[33]

The BPjM maintained that the book was pornographic and dangerous to minors because it contained explicit descriptions of sexual promiscuity, child prostitution, and incest as its exclusive subject matter, and promoted these activities as positive, insignificant, and even humorous behaviors in a manner devoid of any artistic value. The BPjM stated that the contents of the book justified it being placed on the ""list of youth-endangering media"" so that its availability to minors would be restricted.

In 1978 a third publishing house attempted to issue a new edition ofJosefine Mutzenbacherthat included a foreword and omitted the ""glossary of Viennese vulgarisms"" from the 1969 version. The BPjM again placedJosefine Mutzenbacheron its ""list of youth-endangering media,"" and the Rowohlt Publishing house filed an appeal with the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany on the grounds thatJosefine Mutzenbacherwas a work of art that minors should not be restricted from reading.

On 27 November 1990 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany made what is now known as ""The Mutzenbacher Decision"". The Court prefaced their verdict by referring to two other seminal freedom of expression cases from previous German Case Law, theMephisto Decisionand theAnachronistischer ZugDecision. The court ruled that under the German constitution (Grundgesetz) chapter about Freedom of Art (Kunstfreiheit), the novelJosefine Mutzenbacherwas both pornography and art, and that the former is not sufficient to deny the latter.

In plain English, even though the contents ofJosefine Mutzenbacherare pornographic, they are still considered art and in the process of indexing the book, the aspect of freedom of art has to be considered. The court's ruling forced the BPjM to temporarily remove the Rowohlt edition ofJosefine Mutzenbacherfrom its list of youth-endangering media.

The book was added to the list again in November 1992[34]in a new decision by the BPjM which considered the aspect of freedom of art, but deemed the aspect of protecting children to be more important.[35]Some later editions of the book by other publishers were added to the list as well.[31]

Again, the publisher appealed to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) ofCologneand won the case in 1995.[36]However, the BPjM appealed for its part and won in September 1997 at the higher instance,Oberverwaltungsgericht, and theFederal Administrative Court(Bundesverwaltungsgericht) refused further appeal in February 1998.[37]

ThereforeJosefine Mutzenbacherwas taken into the list for 25 years. After this period of time had passed and the indexing ceased, the BPjM decided in November 2017 that there was no more any reason to list the book anew.[31]According to the BPjM, one reason was that, because of the archaic language and parodic style of depiction, the book was no longer considered to conduce its readers to imitate the abusive sexual practices described within. The BPjM also noted that according to current scholarly opinion, the book shows remarkable literary merit, for instance, by tending to present new perspectives to autobiographical works of literature.[38]

In 1976 the heirs of Felix Salten – more precisely, his granddaughter Lea Wyler – demanded the German publishing company Rogner & Bernhard to stop distributing the novelJosefine Mutzenbacherand to payroyalties. In response, the company asked for ""decisive evidence"" for Salten's authorship. The heirs could not provide such evidence.[40]

Ten years later, in June 1986, the heirs instituted an action at theMunichLandgericht courtagainst Rogner & Bernhard, claiming that Salten's authorship could be proven, although they only providedcircumstantial evidence.[41]The court, however, did not examine the question of authorship because, according to the old German Copyright Act, the anonymously published novel had becomePublic Domainin 1957 and the copyright could no longer be reinstituted; that is, Salten's heirs should have declared the authorship before the end of 1956. So, the case was ruled in favour of the publishing company in May 1988.[42]

The heirs appealed to MunichOberlandesgerichtcourt but lost there in July 1989 and, subsequently, also lost at theFederal Court of Justicein early 1990.[43]

Two novels, also written anonymously, which present a continuation of the originalJosephine Mutzenbacher, have been published. However, they are not generally ascribed to Felix Salten.

Also the sequels have been translated into many languages. For instance,Oh! Oh! Josephine: Volume 2from 1973 is an English rendering ofMeine 365 Liebhaber.

In 2000 the Austrian writerFranzobelpublished the novelScala Santa oder Josefine Wurznbachers Höhepunkt(Scala Santa, or Josefine Wurznbacher's Climax). The title's similarity to Josephine Mutzenbacher, being only two letters different, is a play on words that is not just coincidence.[44]The book's content is derivative as well, telling the story of the character ""Pepi Wurznbacher"" and her first sexual experience at age six.[45][46]

The name ""Pepi Wurznbacher"" is taken directly from the pages ofJosephine Mutzenbacher; ""Pepi"" was Josephine Mutzenbacher's nickname in the early chapters.[47][48]Franzobel has said that he wanted his novel to be a retelling of the Josephine Mutzenbacher story set in modern day.[49][50]He simply took the characters, plot elements and setting fromJosephine Mutzenbacherand reworked them into a thoroughly modernized version that occurs in the 1990s.[51]He was inspired to write the novel after being astounded at both the prevalence of child abuse stories in the German press and having readJosephine Mutzenbacher'sblatantly unapologetic depiction of the same.[52]

The three titles directed by Kurt Nachmann aresexploitation films. InAuch Fummeln will gelernt sein, the male lead (""Peter Planer"") plays a sexually dysfunctional army officer who is about to be married.Christine Schuberthreprises her role as a prostitute indistinguishable from the Josephine of the first two films, although in this one she is called Pepi. She correctly diagnoses the soldier's problem as his addiction to pornography and voyeuristic fantasy. The film ends with the soldier and his fiancée tumbling into bed as a copy of Salten's novel is consumed by flames.

The two series directed byHans Billianand Gunter Otto arepornographic films. The first of them, Billian'sJosefine Mutzenbacher wie sie wirklich war, 1. Teil, is routinely cited as one of the best films to emerge from pornography's so-calledgolden age, thanks to Billian's inventive direction and the unselfconscious charm ofPatricia Rhomberg.[53][54][55]Gunter Otto served as producer on the first film, but he and Billian then parted ways, with each directing his own series of sequels. Billian'sDas Haus der geheimen Lüste(1979) is an unrelated pornographic feature in nineteenth-century costume that has been reissued as a Josephine Mutzenbacher film. The last two Gunter Otto films are set in modern times and do not seriously pretend to inhabit the Mutzenbacher universe.

ForMutzenbacher,Ruth Beckermannfilmed a hundred men reading from and reacting to Salten's novel in what was supposedly acasting callfor a new movie adaptation. She uses their responses to build a picture of male sexual attitudes, particularly attitudes to female sexuality. The documentary won the Encounters Award at the72nd Berlin International Film Festival.[56][57]

The Viennesea cappellaquartet called 4she[58]regularly performs a cabaret musical theatre production based onJosephine Mutzenbachercalled ""The 7 Songs of Josefine Mutzenbacher"" (""Die 7 Lieder der Josefine Mutzenbacher""). The show is a raunchy, humorous parody of the novel, set in a brothel, that runs approximately 75 minutes.[4][59][60][61][62][63][64]

In 2002 the German actorJürgen Tarrachand the jazz groupCB-funkperformed a live rendition of the texts of Josephine Mutzenbacher andShakespeareset to modern music composed by Bernd Weißig and arranged by the Pianist Detlef Bielke of theGünther-Fischer-Quintettat theKalkscheune[de]in Berlin.[65][66][67]

In January 2005, Austrian actressUlrike Beimpoldgave several comedy cabaret live performances of the text of Josephine Mutzenbacher at the Auersperg15-Theater in Vienna, Austria.[68]

In an event organized by the Jazzclub Regensburg, Werner Steinmassl held a live musical reading of Josephine Mutzenbacher, accompanied by Andreas Rüsing, at the Leeren Beutel Concert Hall inRatisbon, Bavaria, Germany called ""Werner Steinmassl reads Josefine Mutzenbacher"" on 3 September 2005.[69][70]

Both the original Josephine Mutzenbacher and the two ""sequels"" are available as spoken word audio CDs read by Austrian actress Ulrike Beimpold:

In 1997 Helmut Qualtinger released ""Fifi Mutzenbacher"", a parody on audio CD:

The Jewish Museum of Vienna displayed an exhibit at thePalais Eskelescalled ""Felix Salten: From Josephine Mutzenbacher to Bambi"" where the life and work of Felix Salten was on display, which ran from December 2006 to March 2007. Austrian State Parliament Delegate Elisabeth Vitouch appeared for the opening of the exhibit at Jewish Museum Vienna and declared: ""Everyone knows Bambi and Josefine Mutzenbacher even today, but the author Felix Salten is today to a large extent forgotten"".[13][71][72]

Josephine Mutzenbacherhas been included in several university courses and symposiums.[73]

There are several English translations ofJosefine Mutzenbacher, some of which, however, are pirated editions of each other.[15]Until 2018, all the English translations were missing the original publisher's introduction.[17]

When checked against the German text, the translations differ, and the original chapter and paragraph division is usually not followed, except for the 2018 edition. The original novel is divided only in two long chapters, but most translated editions disrupt the text, each in their own way, into 20–30 chapters, sometimes with added chapter titles.

The 1973 edition,Oh! Oh! Josephine, claims to be ""uncensored and uncut"", but actually it is incomplete and censored, e.g., obfuscating references to anal intercourse.[15]All these issues are replicated in the 1975Finnishtranslation which is made via this English edition.

The first anonymous English translation from 1931 is abridged and leaves part of the sentences untranslated; the 1967 translation by Rudolf Schleifer, however, contains large inauthentic expansions, as shown in the following comparison:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779,The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play),"The Chorus explains that Faustus was low-born, or born of low social rank, but still managed to quickly achieve a doctorate intheologyat theUniversity of Wittenberg. However, his interest in learning and his pride soon led him tonecromancy.

In the first scene of the play, Faustus expresses his boredom and impatience with the various branches of knowledge and concludes that only magic is worth learning. He asks his servant Wagner to return with the magicians Valdes and Cornelius, who have been trying to interest him in magic for some time. While he waits, he is visited by a Good Angel, who tries to dissuade him from this path, and a Bad Angel, who encourages him. Valdes and Cornelius arrive and declare that if Faustus devotes himself to magic, great things are indeed possible with someone of Faustus's learning and intelligence.

While Faustus is at dinner with the magicians, two scholars notice Faustus's absence and ask Wagner about his whereabouts. When Wagner tells them he is with Valdes and Cornelius, the scholars worry that the magicians have corrupted him and leave to inform the rector of the university.

Faustus attempts to conjure a devil, andMephistophelesarrives. Faustus believes that he has summoned him, but Mephistopheles says that he came of his own accord, and that he servesLucifer, and cannot do anything without his leave. Faustus questions Mephistopheles about Lucifer and Hell, and tells him to speak to Lucifer and return. The next scene is a comedic reflection in which Wagner calls two devils, with which he scares the Clown into serving him.

Mephistopheles returns, and Faustus signs a contract in his own blood: Mephistopheles will serve him for 24 years, at which point Lucifer will claim him, body and soul. Once the contract is signed, Faustus asks for a wife, but Mephistopheles declines, saying marriage is ""but a ceremonial toy""; he asks for books of knowledge, and Mephistopheles provides a single book. In the corresponding comedic scene, Robin, ahostler, has stolen a conjuring book, and plans mischief with it.

Faustus begins to waver and think about God and is visited again by the Good and Bad Angels. Lucifer arrives to remind him of his contract and entertains him with a show of the Seven Deadly Sins. Faustus and Mephistopheles then travel Europe, eventually arriving in Rome, where they play tricks on the Pope. Next, Robin and Rafe (A version) or Dick (B version), having been caught for stealing a goblet, call on Mephistopheles, who arrives and angrily turns them into animals before returning to attend on Faustus. Faustus has been called to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, where he and Mephistopheles conjureAlexander the Greatand hisparamourand give a knightcuckold's hornsfor being aheckler. In the A version, the emperor asks Faust to relent, and he does; in the B version a longer scene follows in which the knight and his friends attack Faustus; all are given horns. In both versions, Faustus then plays tricks on a horse dealer. Faustus and Mephistopheles then put on a magic show for theDuke and Duchess of Vanholt.

When Faustus's 24 years are nearly up, he bequeaths his possessions to Wagner. He conjuresHelen of Troyfor some students, and, when he starts to think of repenting again, renews his pledge to Lucifer and asks Mephistopheles for Helen as his lover. In the final scene, Faustus admits to some scholars that he has bargained away his soul; despite their prayers, the devils come for him.

The theological implications ofDoctor Faustushave been the subject of considerable debate. Among the most complicated points of contention is whether the play supports or challenges theCalvinistdoctrine of absolute predestination, which dominated the lectures and writings of many English scholars in the latter half of the sixteenth century. According to Calvin,predestinationmeant that God, acting of his own free will, elects some people to be saved and others to be damned—thus, the individual has no control over his own ultimate fate. This doctrine was the source of great controversy because it was seen by the so-called anti-Calvinists to limit man's free will in regard to faith and salvation, and to present a dilemma in terms oftheodicy.

At the timeDoctor Faustuswas performed, this doctrine was on the rise in England, and under the direction ofPuritantheologians at Cambridge and Oxford had come to be considered the orthodox position of theChurch of England.[36]Nevertheless, it remained the source of vigorous and, at times, heated debate between Calvinist scholars, such asWilliam WhitakerandWilliam Perkins, and anti-Calvinists, such as William Barrett andPeter Baro.[37]The dispute between these Cambridge intellectuals had quite nearly reached its zenith by the time Marlowe was a student there in the 1580s, and likely would have influenced him deeply, as it did many of his fellow students.[38]

Concerning the fate of Faustus, the Calvinist concludes that his damnation was inevitable. His rejection of God and subsequent inability to repent are taken as evidence that he never really belonged to the elect but rather had been predestined from the very beginning forreprobation.[39]For the Calvinist, Faustus represents the worst kind of sinner, having tasted the heavenly gift and rejected it. His damnation is justified and deserved because he was never truly adopted among the elect. According to this view, the play demonstrates Calvin's ""three-tiered concept of causation,"" in which the damnation of Faustus is first willed by God, then by Satan, and finally, by himself.[40]

""Ravished"" by magic (1.1.112), Faustus turns to the dark arts when law, logic, science, and theology fail to satisfy him. According toCharles Nichollthis places the play firmly in the Elizabethan period when the problem of magic (""liberation or damnation?"") was a matter of debate, and whenRenaissance occultismaimed at a furthering of science. Nicholl, who connects Faustus as a ""studious artisan"" (1.1.56) to the ""hands-on experience"" promoted byParacelsus, sees in the former a follower of the latter, a ""magician as technologist"".[12]

The play is well-known for a famous line:""Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"", said by Faustus upon seeing a demon impersonatingHelen.[41]The line is a paraphrase of a statement fromLucian'sDialogues of the Dead.[42][41]It is frequently quoted out of context to convey astonishment at Helen's beauty.[41]However, inDoctor Faustus, it is said to a devil posing as Helen, and is a response to the illusion; it may even express disappointment that she is not more beautiful.[41]The German poet and polymathJohann Wolfgang von Goethere-envisioned the meeting ofFaustand Helen.  InFaust: The Second Part of the Tragedy, the union of Helen and Faust becomes a complex allegory of the meeting of the classical-ideal and modern worlds.

Religionis a central theme represented throughout the play by using Dr. Faustus to portray the struggles of religious belief and worldly knowledge. The play explores the conflict between religious piety and the temptation of earthly power and wisdom. The text is deeply rooted inChristiantheology given its references to heaven, hell, devils, and biblical characters while simultaneously portraying anti-religious imagery which in turn reflects the criticism of religion during theReformation.[43]

Faustus's fate reflects the theme of seeking redemption and salvation through a religious perspective.[44]Despite several occasions of listening to the warnings from the scholars about the consequences of his actions, Faustus continues down his path of sin. It is not until his deal with Mephistopheles must be fulfilled that he begs for God's mercy and the chance to repent. In the end, his prayers go unanswered as he is ultimately damned, highlighting the irreversible consequences of his choices.

In the past, it was assumed that the comic scenes within the play were additions by other writers and were not written by Christopher Marlowe himself. However, most scholars today consider the comic interludes an integral part of the play, regardless of their author, and so they continue to be included in print.[45]The tone of the comedic scenes throughout both A-text and B-text shows the progressive change in Faustus' ambitions, which, in turn, created various theories of the composers of the comedic lines.[46]

TheClownsand comedic figures in Marlowe'sDoctor Faustus(Wagner, Robin, and Rafe) serve as bothcomic reliefand demonstrate that anyone can access thesupernaturalregardless of their degree of experience.[47]The scenes including clown characters provide a lighter alternate outlook ofdemonicstudies.[47]Additionally, scholar Bryan Lowrance suggests thatChristopher Marloweutilizeshumorto make various positions in society easier to grasp.[48]

The first television adaptation was broadcast in 1947 by the BBC starringDavid King-Woodas Faustus andHugh Griffithas Mephistopheles.[49]In 1958, another BBC television version starredWilliam Squireas Faustus in an adaptation by Ronald Eyre intended for schools.[50]In 1961, the BBC adapted the play for television as a two-episode production starringAlan Dobieas Faustus; this production was also meant for use in schools.[51]

The play wasadapted for the screenin 1967 byRichard BurtonandNevill Coghill, who based the film on an Oxford University Dramatic Society production in which Burton starred oppositeElizabeth Tayloras Helen of Troy.

There have been several adaptations on BBC Radio and elsewhere:

TheDoctor Faustusplay was written byChristopher MarlowepostProtestant Reformation, and during the height ofElizabethan era. The religious reformation, or otherwise known as the Protestant Reformation, of the Elizabethan era helped the various religious, moral, and philosophical questions presented by Marlowe inDoctor Faustusto even be considered as legitimate, answerable questions at the time.[62]It is also believed by some that theDoctor Faustusplay tapped into some form of post reformation religious trauma for its viewers, which furthered its overall cultural significance and impact for its early audiences.[63]Doctor Faustushas raised much controversy due to Faust's alleged interaction with the demonic realm.[64]Before Marlowe, there were few authors who ventured into this kind of writing. After his play, other authors began to expand on their views of the spiritual world.[65]Marlowe also never specifies the intentions of his play, or who it was intended to be directed towards.[66]This lack of specification has since led to the increase of academic interest in both A and B texts.[67]Nonetheless, theDoctor Faustusplay also served and continues to serve as a representation for the restless, rebellious, and inquisitive minds ofRenaissancewriters and culture.[66]

Furthermore,Doctor Faustushas sparked extensive critical debate since its first performances. As Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith observe, “no Elizabethan play outside theShakespearecanon has raised more controversy” regarding its textual history, date of composition, and interpretive ambiguity. They emphasize that the centrality of the Faust legend in Western intellectual history complicates any attempt at a definitive reading of the play. Over the centuries, scholars have variously interpreted the play as a Christian morality tale, a critique of Renaissance ambition, asatireof scholasticism, and a reflection of Marlowe’s own views onreligionandhumanism.[68]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/996,Don Quixote,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote,"For Cervantes and the readers of his day,Don Quixotewas a one-volume book published in 1605, divided internally into four parts, not the first part of a two-part set. The mention in the 1605 book of further adventures yet to be told was totally conventional, did not indicate any authorial plans for a continuation, and was not taken seriously by the book's first readers.[14]

Cervantes, in ametafictionalnarrative, writes that the first few chapters were taken from ""the archives of La Mancha"", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by theMoorishhistorianCide Hamete Benengeli.

Alonso Quixanois ahidalgonearing 50 years of age who lives in a deliberately unspecified region ofLa Manchawith his niece and housekeeper. While he lives a frugal life, he is full of fantasies about chivalry stemming from his obsession with chivalric romance books. Eventually, his obsession becomes madness when he decides to become aknight errant, donning an old suit of armor. He renames himself ""Don Quixote"", names his old workhorse ""Rocinante"", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo (a slaughterhouse worker with a famed hand for salting pork) hislady love, renaming herDulcinea del Toboso.

As he travels in search of adventure, he arrives at an inn that he believes to be a castle, calls the prostitutes he meets there ""ladies"", and demands that the innkeeper, whom he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. The innkeeper agrees. Quixote starts the night holdingvigilat the inn's horse trough, which Quixote imagines to be a chapel. He then becomes involved in a fight withmuleteerswho try to remove his armor from the horse trough to water their mules. In a pretend ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.

Quixote next encounters a servant named Andres who is tied to a tree and being beaten by his master over disputed wages. Quixote orders the master to stop the beating, untie Andres and swear to treat his servant fairly. However, the beating is resumed, and redoubled, as soon as Quixote leaves.

Quixote then chances upon traders fromToledo. He demands that they agree that Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world. One of them demands to see her picture so that he can decide for himself. Enraged, Quixote charges at them but his horse stumbles, causing him to fall. One of the traders beats up Quixote, who is left at the side of the road until a neighboring peasant brings him back home.

While Quixote lies unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parishcurate, and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books, seeing them as the root of his madness. They seal up the library room, later telling Quixote that it was done by a wizard.

Don Quixote asks his neighbour, the poor farm labourerSancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship. Sancho agrees and they sneak away at dawn. Their adventures together begin with Quixote's attack on some windmills which he believes to be ferocious giants. They next encounter two Benedictinefriarsand, nearby, an unrelated lady in a carriage. Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who are holding the lady captive, knocks one of them from his horse, and is challenged by an armedBasquetravelling with the company. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and begging him not to harm the Basque.

After a friendly encounter with some goatherds and a less friendly one with someYanguesanporters drivingGalician ponies, Quixote and Sancho enter an inn owned by Juan Palomeque, where a mix-up involving a servant girl's romantic rendezvous with another guest results in a brawl. Quixote explains to Sancho that the inn is enchanted. They decide to leave, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed in the air by several mischievous guests at the inn before he manages to follow.

After further adventures involving a dead body, a barber's basin that Quixote imagines as the legendary helmet ofMambrino, and a group ofgalley slaves, they wander into theSierra Morena. There they encounter the dejected and mostly mad Cardenio, who relateshis story. Inspired by Cardenio, Quixote decides to imitate what he has read in his chivalric romances and live like a hermit in a display of devotion to Dulcinea. He sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village. They make a plan to trick Quixote into coming home, recruiting Dorotea, a woman they discover in the forest, to pose as the Princess Micomicona, a damsel in distress.

The plan works and Quixote and the group return to the inn, though Quixote is now convinced, thanks to a lie told by Sancho when asked about the letter, that Dulcinea wants to see him. At the inn, several other plots intersect and are resolved. Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Quixote does battle with somewineskinswhich he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomicona's kingdom. An officer of theSanta Hermandadarrives with a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves, but the priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees and Quixote is locked in a cage which he is made to think is an enchantment. He has a learned conversation with a Toledocanonhe encounters by chance on the road, in which the canon expresses his scorn for untruthful chivalric books, but Don Quixote defends them. The group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, before he is finally brought home.

The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.

Although the two parts are now published as a single work,Don Quixote, Part Twowas a sequel published ten years after the original novel. In an early example ofmetafiction, Part Two indicates that several of its characters have read the first part of the novel and are thus familiar with the history and peculiarities of the two protagonists.

Don Quixote and Sancho are on their way to El Toboso to meet Dulcinea, with Sancho aware that his story about Dulcinea was a complete fabrication. They reach the city at daybreak and decide to enter at nightfall. However, a bad omen frightens Quixote into retreat and they quickly leave. Sancho is instead sent out alone by Quixote to meet Dulcinea and act as a go-between. Sancho's luck brings three peasant girls along the road and he quickly tells Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting and as beautiful as ever. Since Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho goes on to pretend that an enchantment of some sort is at work.

A duke and duchess encounter the duo. These nobles have read Part One of the story and are themselves very fond of books of chivalry. They decide to play along for their own amusement, beginning a string of imagined adventures and practical jokes. As part of one prank, Quixote and Sancho are led to believe that the only way to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets his promised governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler before all ends in humiliation. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.

Quixote battles the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Quixote's hometown who had earlier posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach inBarcelona. Defeated, Quixote submits to prearranged chivalric terms: the vanquished must obey the will of the conqueror. He is ordered to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for a period of one year, by which time his friends and relatives hope he will be cured.

On the way back home, Quixote and Sancho ""resolve"" the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Upon returning to his village, Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully become Alonso Quixano once more. Sancho tries to restore his faith and his interest in Dulcinea, but Quixano only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry.

After Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.

Don Quixote, Part Onecontains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of thepicaresquefigures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is ""El Curioso Impertinente"" (The Ill-Advised Curiosity), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of aFlorentinenobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity and talks his close friendLothariointo attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.

InPart Two, the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions inPart Oneand promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, ""Part Two"" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.

Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.[15]

Thestory within a storyrelates that, for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates; an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.

One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: When Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.

Later, the maid's lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen, and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife's affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish. Lothario is killed in battle soon afterward and Camilla dies of grief.

The novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming inDon Quixotemakes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the namesRocinante[16](a reversal) andDulcinea(an allusion to illusion), and the wordquixoteitself, possibly a pun onquijada(jaw) but certainly[17][18]cuixot(Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse'srump.[19]

As a military term, the wordquijoterefers tocuisses, part of a full suit ofplate armourprotecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix-otedenotes the augmentative—for example,grandemeans large, butgrandotemeans extra large, with grotesque connotations. Following this example,Quixotewould suggest 'The Great Quijano', an oxymoronic play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.[20]

Cervantes wrote his work inEarly Modern Spanish, heavily borrowing fromOld Spanish, the medieval form of the language. The language ofDon Quixote, although still containingarchaisms, is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of thePoema de mio Cid, a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language asMiddle Englishis fromModern English. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.

InDon Quixote, there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource—he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that drove him to madness; and many times when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote useKing James Bibleor Shakespearean English, or evenMiddle English.)[21][22]

In Old Castilian, the letterxrepresented the sound writtenshin modern English, so the name was originally pronounced[kiˈʃote]. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, asound changecaused it to be pronounced with avoiceless velar fricative[x]sound (like theScotsorGermanch), and today the Spanish pronunciation of ""Quixote"" is[kiˈxote]. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such asAsturian,Leonese,Galician,Catalan,Italian,Portuguese,TurkishandFrench, where it is pronounced with a ""sh"" or ""ch"" sound; the French operaDon Quichotteis one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.

Today, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation ofQuixote(Quijote), as/kiːˈhoʊti/,[1]although the traditional Englishspelling-based pronunciationwith the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in/ˈkwɪksət/or/ˈkwɪksoʊt/. InAustralian English, the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was/ˈkwɪksət/until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to ""anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly"".[23]The traditional English rendering is preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival formquixotic, i.e.,/kwɪkˈsɒtɪk/,[24][25]defined byMerriam-Websteras the foolishly impractical pursuit of ideals, typically marked by rash and lofty romanticism.[26]

Harold BloomsaysDon Quixoteis the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war withFreud'sreality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying. Bloom says that the novel has an endless range of meanings, but that a recurring theme is the human need to withstand suffering.[27]

Edith Grossman, who wrote and published a highly acclaimed[28]English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:

The novel's structure isepisodicin form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, asingenioso(Spanish) means ""quick with inventiveness"",[30]marking the transition of modern literature fromdramaticto thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.

Althoughburlesqueon the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works byPablo PicassoandRichard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat diddy, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.

Even faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire oforthodoxy, veracity and even nationalism.[citation needed]In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped lead literary practice beyond the narrow convention of thechivalric romance. Hespoofsthe chivalric romance[31]through a straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to theknightly virtuesof the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the wordquixoticwas quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed,Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase ""tilting at windmills"" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.

It stands in a unique position between medievalromanceand the modern novel. The former consists of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through ""having read his adventures"", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more ""Alonso Quixano the Good"".

The cave ofMedrano[32](also known as thecasa de Medrano) inArgamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Miguel de Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write his famous work ""Don Quixote de la Mancha.""[33][34][35][36][37][38][39]

Sources forDon Quixoteinclude the Castilian novelAmadis de Gaula, which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, isTirant lo Blanch, which the priest describes in Chapter VI ofQuixoteas ""the best book in the world."" (However, the sense in which it was ""best"" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called ""the most difficult passage ofDon Quixote"".) The scene of the book burning provides a list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.

Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poemOrlando furioso. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet ofMambrino, an episode from Canto I ofOrlando, and itself a reference toMatteo Maria Boiardo'sOrlando innamorato.[40]The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 ofOrlando, regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.[41]

Another important source appears to have been Apuleius'sThe Golden Ass, one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale ""The Curious Impertinent"" in chapter 35 of the first part ofDon Quixoteis a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.[42]Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.

Cervantes' experiences as agalley slavein Algiers also influencedQuixote.[43]

Medical theories may have also influenced Cervantes' literary process. Cervantes had familial ties to the distinguished medical community. His father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, and his great-grandfather, Juan Díaz de Torreblanca, were surgeons. Additionally, his sister, Andrea de Cervantes, was a nurse.[44]He also befriended many individuals involved in the medical field, in that he knew medical author Francisco Díaz, an expert in urology, and royal doctorAntonio Ponce de Santa Cruzwho served as a personal doctor to both Philip III and Philip IV of Spain.[45]

Apart from the personal relations Cervantes maintained within the medical field, Cervantes' personal life was defined by an interest in medicine. He frequently visited patients from the Hospital de Inocentes in Sevilla.[44]Furthermore, Cervantes explored medicine in his personal library. His library contained more than 200 volumes and included books likeExamen de Ingenios, byJuan HuarteandPractica y teórica de cirugía, by Dionisio Daza Chacón that defined medical literature and medical theories of his time.[45]

Researchers Isabel Sanchez Duque and Francisco Javier Escudero have found that Cervantes was a friend of the family Villaseñor, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acuña. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road fromEl TobosotoMiguel Estebanin 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of ""hidalgo"", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.[46][47]

It is not certain when Cervantes began writingPart TwoofDon Quixote, but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. In about September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitledSecond Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate)Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, ofTordesillas, was published inTarragonaby an unidentifiedAragonesewho was an admirer ofLope de Vega, rival of Cervantes.[48]It was translated intoEnglishby William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.

Some modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda's book in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that Cervantes encountered it, which may have been much earlier.

Avellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes'sSegunda Partelend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.

In his introduction toThe Portable Cervantes,Samuel Putnam, a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version ""one of the most disgraceful performances in history"".[49]

The second part of Cervantes'Don Quixote, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics[50]as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes'sSegunda Parte, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda'sSecond Partbeing printed there, in an early example ofmetafiction.[51]Don Quixote and Sancho Panza also meet one of the characters from Avellaneda's book, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and make him swear that the ""other"" Quixote and Sancho are impostors.[52]

Cervantes' story takes place on the plains ofLa Mancha, specifically thecomarcaofCampo de Montiel.

The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence ofDon Quixotehas been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/786,Hard Times,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Times_(novel),"The novel follows a classical tripartite structure, and the titles of each book are related toGalatians6:7, ""For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."" Book I is entitled ""Sowing"", Book II is entitled ""Reaping"", and the third is ""Garnering.""

SuperintendentMr. Gradgrindopens the novel at his school in Coketown stating, ""Now, what I want is Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts"", and interrogates one of his pupils, Cecilia (nicknamed Sissy), whose father works at a circus. Because her father works withhorses, Gradgrind demands the definition of ahorse. When she is scolded for her inability to factually define a horse, her classmate Bitzer gives a zoological profile, and Sissy is censured for suggesting that she would carpet a floor with pictures of flowers or horses.

Louisa and Thomas, two of Mr. Gradgrind's children, go after school to see the touring circus run by Mr. Sleary, only to meet their father, who orders them home. Mr. Gradgrind has three younger children: Adam Smith (afterthe famous theoristof laissez-faire policy), Malthus (after Rev.Thomas Malthus, who wroteAn Essay on the Principle of Population, warning of the dangers of future overpopulation), and Jane.

Josiah Bounderby, ""a man perfectly devoid of sentiment"", is revealed as Gradgrind's close friend. Bounderby is a manufacturer and mill owner who is affluent as a result of hisenterpriseandcapital. He often gives dramatic and falsified accounts of his childhood.

As they consider her a bad influence on the other children, Gradgrind and Bounderby prepare to dismiss Sissy from the school; but the two soon discover her father has abandoned her thereto, in hope that she will lead a better life without him. Mr. Gradgrind gives Sissy a choice: to return to the circus and its kindly manager, Mr. Sleary, and forfeit her education, or to continue her education and work for Mrs. Gradgrind, never returning to the circus. Sissy accepts the latter, hoping to be reunited with her father. At the Gradgrind house, Tom and Louisa befriend Sissy but they are all discontent with their strict upbringing.

Amongst the mill workers, known as ""the Hands"", is a gloomy man named Stephen Blackpool (nicknamed ""Old Stephen""): another of the story's protagonists. When introduced, he has ended his day's work and meets his close friend Rachael. On entering his house he finds that his drunken wife – who has been living away from him – has made an unwelcome return. Stephen is greatly perturbed, and visits Bounderby to ask how he can legally end his marriage and marry Rachael. Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's housekeeper, disapproves of Stephen's query and Bounderby explains that ending a marriage would be complex and prohibitively costly. When Stephen points out the injustice of this, Bounderby accuses him of having ideas above his station. Leaving the house, Stephen meets an old woman who seems interested in Bounderby and says she visits Coketown once a year. Upon returning, he finds Rachael caring for his wife, and stays until three o'clock. When Rachael falls asleep, Mrs. Blackpool wakes up and mistakes a bottle of medicine for alcohol. Despite knowing that she will die if she drinks the entire bottle, Stephen does not move to stop her. Rachael wakes and is able to prevent Mrs. Blackpool from poisoning herself, and Stephen, horrified by his lack of action, finds strength and resolve to bear his suffering.

Several years pass. Sissy becomes Gradgrind's housekeeper, caring for his younger children. Gradgrind tells Louisa that Josiah Bounderby, 30 years her senior, has proposed marriage to her, and quotes statistics to prove that an age difference does not make a marriage unhappy or short. Louisa passively accepts the offer, and the newlyweds set out to Lyons (Lyon), where Bounderby wants to observe how labour is used in the factories there. Tom, her brother, elatedly bids her farewell.

Book Two opens on Bounderby's bank in Coketown, over which the ""light porter"", Sissy's old classmate Bitzer, and the austere Mrs. Sparsit keep watch at the afternoon. A well-dressed gentleman asks for directions to Bounderby's house, as Gradgrind has sent him from London with a letter of introduction. It is James Harthouse, who has tried several occupations and been bored by all of them.

Harthouse is introduced to Bounderby, who accepts him and then regales him with improbable and brief mentions of his childhood. Harthouse is utterly bored by him, but enamoured of the now-melancholy Louisa. Louisa's brother Tom works for Bounderby, and has become reckless and wayward in his conduct. Tom admires Harthouse, who holds him in some contempt, and Tom discloses contempt for Bounderby in the presence of Harthouse, who notes Louisa's affection for Tom and later learns that Tom has money problems – and that Tom persuaded Louisa to marry Bounderby to make his own life easier.

At a crowded union meeting, the agitator Slackbridge accuses Stephen Blackpool of treachery because he will not join the union, and Stephen learns he is to be 'sent to Coventry' – shunned by all his fellow workers. Summoned by Bounderby, he is asked what the men are complaining of; and when Stephen tries to explain, Bounderby accuses Stephen of being a troublemaker and sacks him. Later Louisa and Tom visit Stephen, expressing regret, and Louisa gives him some money. Privately, Tom tells him to wait outside the bank after work.

When a robbery takes place at the bank, Stephen is suspected of the crime; even more so as he had left the town the next day. Mrs. Sparsit observes the advancing relationship between James Harthouse and Louisa, and suspects an adulterous liaison. Unable to hear their dialogue, she assumes the affair is progressing. When Harthouse confesses his love for Louisa, Louisa refuses him. They leave separately, and Mrs. Sparsit follows Louisa to the station, where Louisa boards a train to her father's house; Mrs Sparsit loses her. When Louisa arrives, she is in an extreme state of distress. Having argued that her rigorous education has stifled her ability to express her emotions, Louisa collapses at her father's feet in a dead faint.

At Bounderby's London hotel, Mrs. Sparsit gives him the news her surveillance has brought. Bounderby takes her back to Coketown and to Stone Lodge, where Louisa is resting. Gradgrind tells Bounderby that Louisa resisted Harthouse's advances, but has experienced a crisis and needs time to recover. Bounderby is immensely indignant and ill-mannered, especially towards Mrs. Sparsit for misleading him. Ignoring Gradgrind's pleas, he announces that unless Louisa returns to him the next day, the marriage will end. She does not come back.

Harthouse leaves Coketown after Sissy tells him never to return. As Slackbridge increasingly blackens Stephen Blackpool's name, Rachael goes to the bank to say she knows where he is, and that she will write asking him to return to Coketown to clear his name. Bounderby is suspicious when she tells him Stephen was visited by Louisa and Tom the night he was dismissed, and brings her to Gradgrind's house where Louisa confirms Rachael's account.

Mrs Sparsit eventually tracks down Mrs Pegler, the old woman who makes a mysterious annual visit to see Bounderby's house, and brings her to the house where she is revealed as Bounderby's mother. Far from having abandoned him to a life of hardship, she gave him a good upbringing and, when he became successful, allowed herself to be persuaded never to visit him. Bounderby is now publicly exposed as a ridiculous humbug 'bully of humility'.

On a Sunday outing, Rachael and Sissy find Stephen, who has fallen down an abandoned pit shaft while walking back to Coketown. He is rescued by villagers but, after professing his innocence and speaking to Rachael for the last time, he dies. Louisa and Sissy now suspect that Tom has committed the bank robbery, and simply told Stephen to loiter outside the bank in order to incriminate him. Sissy has already helped Tom escape by sending him to join Mr. Sleary's circus. Louisa and Sissy find Tom there, disguised inblackface. Gradgrind arrives and despairs, and a plan is hatched with Sleary's co-operation to get Tom to Liverpool, where he can escape abroad. The plan is temporarily foiled by the arrival of Bitzer, who hopes to obtain promotion from Bounderby by bringing Tom to justice, but Sleary arranges an ambush and Tom is taken to Liverpool where he boards ship.

Bounderby punishes Mrs Sparsit for his humiliation by turning her out, but she doesn't particularly mind the dishonour. Five years later, he will die of a fit in the street, while Mr. Gradgrind, having abandoned his Utilitarian ideas and trying to make Facts ""subservient to Faith, Hope and Charity"", will suffer the contempt of his fellow MPs. Rachael will continue her life of honest hard work, while Stephen Blackpool will be pardoned by Mr Gradgrind. Tom will die from fever fairly near Coketown, having expressed penitence in a tear-stained letter. Louisa herself will grow old, but will never remarry and have children of her own. Louisa, showing kindness to the less fortunate and being loved by Sissy's children, will spend her life encouraging imagination and fancy in all she encounters.

Thomas Gradgrindis the notorious school board Superintendent, who is dedicated to the pursuit of profitable enterprise. His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers, a follower ofUtilitarianideas who neglects the imagination. He soon sees the error of these beliefs however, when his children's lives fall into disarray.

Josiah Bounderbyis a business associate of Mr. Gradgrind. Given to boasting about being a self-made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel. He has risen to a position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims). He marries Mr. Gradgrind's daughter Louisa, some 30 years his junior, in what turns out to be a loveless marriage. They have no children. Bounderby is callous, self-centred and ultimately revealed to be a liar and fraud.

Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind, (laterLouisa Bounderby), is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family. She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as a child that she has ""unmanageable thoughts.""  After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father. Her rejection of Harthouse leads to a new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination. She reproaches her father for his dry and fact-based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.

Cecilia (Sissy) Jupeis a circus girl of Sleary's circus, as well as a student of Gradgrind's. Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household. At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds' philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.

She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind's extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school. Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in. With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy's father that she can no longer attend his school.

While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe abandoned his daughter. In a moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her a second chance at the school. Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.

While Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason. She cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind's classroom because she has a more realistic view of how the world should be perceived. After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live a new, happy life.[2]

Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junioris the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds. Initially sullen and resentful of his father's Utilitarian education, Tom has a strong relationship with his sister Louisa. He works in Bounderby's bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking. Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.

Stephen Blackpoolis a worker at one of Bounderby's mills. He has a drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time. He forms a close bond with Rachael, a co-worker, whom he wishes to marry. After a dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere. While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby's bank. On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down a mine-shaft. He is rescued but dies of his injuries."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10007,Carmilla,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla,"Le Fanu presents the story as part of the casebook of Dr. Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the firstoccult detectivein literature.[7]

Laura, the teenaged protagonist, narrates, beginning with her childhood in a ""picturesque and solitary"" castle amid an extensive forest inStyria, where she lives with her father, a wealthyEnglishwidower retired from service to theAustrian Empire. When she was six, Laura had a vision of a very beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found. All the household assure Laura that it was just a dream, but they step up security as well and there is no subsequent vision or visitation.

Twelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to visit them with his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, but Bertha suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognise each other from the ""dream"" they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, her past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura. Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.

Meanwhile, young women and girls in the nearby towns have begun dying from an unknown malady. When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn. Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura, complaining that the hymn hurts her ears.

When a shipment of restoredheirloompaintings arrives, Laura finds a portrait of her ancestor, Countess Mircalla Karnstein, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck. Carmilla suggests that she might be descended from the Karnsteins, though the family died out centuries before.

During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a large, cat-like beast entering her room. The beast springs onto the bed and Laura feels something like two needles, an inch or two apart, darting deep into her breast. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, ""Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin,"" and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her nightdress drenched in blood. Laura's health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small, blue spot, an inch or two below her collar, where the creature in her dream bit her, and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.

Her father sets out with Laura, in a carriage, for the ruined village of Karnstein, three miles distant. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses to follow once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla awakes. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story.

At a costume ball, Spielsdorf and his niece Bertha had met a very beautiful young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother. Bertha was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.

Bertha fell mysteriously ill, suffering the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realised that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid with a sword and waited until a large, black creature of undefined shape crawled onto his niece's bed and spread itself onto her throat. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the creature, which had then taken the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died before the morning dawned.

Upon arriving at Karnstein, the General asks a woodman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodman says the tomb was relocated long ago by a Moravian nobleman who vanquished the vampires haunting the region.

While the General and Laura are alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other, and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla disarms the General and disappears. The General explains that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.

The party is joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An imperial commission exhumes the body of Mircalla. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then, the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.

Afterwards, Laura's father takes his daughter on a year-long tour through Italy to regain her health and recover from the trauma, but she never fully does.

“Carmilla” exhibits the primary characteristics of Gothic fiction. It includes a supernatural figure, a dark setting of an old castle, a mysterious atmosphere, and ominous or superstitious elements.[9]

In the novella, Le Fanu abolishes the Victorian view of women as merely useful possessions of men, relying on them and needing their constant guardianship. The male characters of the story, such as Laura's father and General Spielsdorf, are exposed as being the opposite of the putative Victorian males – helpless and unproductive.[10]The nameless father reaches an agreement with Carmilla's mother, whereas Spielsdorf cannot control the faith of his niece, Bertha. Both of these scenes portray women as equal, if not superior to men.[11]This female empowerment is even more clear if we consider Carmilla's vampiric predecessors and their relationship with their prey.[12]Carmilla is the opposite of those male vampires – she is actually involved with her victims both emotionally and (theoretically) sexually. Moreover, she is able to exceed even more limitations by dominating death. In the end, her immortality is suggested to be sustained by the river where her ashes had been scattered.[13]

Le Fanu also departs from the negative idea of female parasitism and lesbianism by depicting a mutual and irresistible connection between Carmilla and Laura.[14]The latter, along with other female characters, becomes a symbol of all Victorian women – restrained and judged for their emotional reflexes. The ambiguity of Laura's speech and behaviour reveals her struggles with being fully expressive of her concerns and desires.[15]

Another important element of “Carmilla” is the concept of dualism presented through the juxtaposition of vampire and human, as well as lesbian and heterosexual.[16]It is also vivid in Laura's irresolution, since she ""feels both attraction and repulsion"" towards Carmilla.[17]The duality of Carmilla's character is suggested by her human attributes, the lack of predatory demeanour, and her shared experience with Laura.[18]According to Gabriella Jönsson, Carmilla can be seen as a representation of the dark side of all mankind.[19]

As withDracula, critics have looked for the sources used in the writing ofCarmilla. One source used was from a dissertation on magic, vampires, and the apparitions of spirits written byDom Augustin CalmetentitledTraité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenants de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.(1751). This is evidenced by a report analysed by Calmet, from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity three years earlier. Having travelled to the town to investigate and collecting information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming from the nearby cemetery and would haunt many of the residents on their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveller came to the town during this period and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery and decapitating the vampire that resided there, curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by Le Fanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter ofCarmilla.[20][21][22][23]

According to Matthew Gibson,the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould'sThe Book of Were-wolves(1863) and his account ofElizabeth Báthory,Coleridge'sChristabel(Part 1, 1797 and Part 2, 1800), and CaptainBasil Hall'sSchlossHainfeld; or a Winter inLower Styria(London and Edinburgh, 1836) are other sources for Le Fanu'sCarmilla. Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and, in particular, a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure ofJane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall.[24][25]

Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female andlesbian vampires. Although Le Fanu portrays his vampire'ssexualitywith the circumspection that one would expect for his time[clarification needed], lesbian attraction evidently is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:[26][27]

When compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla hadnocturnalhabits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as inDracula. She did, however, sleep in a coffin.Carmillaworks as aGothichorror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.[28]

Some critics, among themWilliam Veeder, suggest thatCarmilla, notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence onHenry James'The Turn of the Screw(1898).[29]

Le Fanu's work has been noted as an influence on Bram Stoker's masterwork of the genre,Dracula:

In April 2025, theLukashenko regimeadded the book to the List of printed publications containing information messages and materials, the distribution of which could harm thenational interestsofBelarus.[88]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow,"The story is set in 1790 in the countryside near the formerDutch settlementofTarry Town, in a secludedglenknown asSleepy Hollow. It relates the tale ofIchabod Crane, a lean, lanky, superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut. Ichabod intends to woo Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, in order to procure her family's riches for himself. He competes for her affection with Abraham ""Brom Bones"" Van Brunt, the town rowdy. Unable to goad Ichabod into fighting for Katrina's hand, Brom instead wages a campaign of harassment against the schoolmaster, plaguing him with a series of pranks and practical jokes.

One autumn night, Ichabod is invited to attend a harvest party at the Van Tassel homestead. At the party, Brom tells the story of the Headless Horseman, the notorious ghost of aHessian trooperdecapitated by a cannonball during theRevolutionary War. The Horseman is supposedly buried in a churchyard in Sleepy Hollow and rises from his grave every night to search for his missing head but is supernaturally barred from crossing a wooden bridge that spans a nearby stream.

Katrina rejects Ichabod before he leaves. He leaves the party crestfallen and rides home on a borrowed plow horse named Gunpowder. He encounters a cloaked rider and believes it to be the Headless Horseman. Ichabod rides for his life with the apparition close behind. At the bridge, the Horseman rears his horse and hurls his severed head directly at Crane, knocking him off his horse.

The next morning, Gunpowder is found eating the grass at his master's gate, but Ichabod has disappeared from the area, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones. Although the true nature of both the Headless Horseman and Ichabod's disappearance is left open to interpretation, it is implied that the Horseman was actually Brom. A shattered pumpkin is found near Ichabod's hat where he fell, suggesting that the severed head thrown at him was merely ajack-o'-lanternand that Crane survived the fall from Gunpowder and fled Sleepy Hollow in horror.

In a postscript, a Mr. Knickerbocker recounts hearing the tale at a Corporation meeting in Manhattan, narrated by a humorous, shabby gentleman. The story ends with mixed reactions from the audience, including laughter and skepticism. A serious old gentleman questions the moral of the story, to which the storyteller humorously responds that the tale proves life's situations have their advantages if one can find humor in them. The old gentleman remains puzzled, and the storyteller admits he doesn't believe half of the story himself.

The story was the longest one published as part ofThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.(commonly referred to asThe Sketch Book), which Irving issued serially throughout 1819 and 1820, using the pseudonym ""Geoffrey Crayon"".[2]Irving wroteThe Sketch Bookduring a tour of Europe, and parts of the tale may also be traced to European origins. Headless horsemen were staples ofnorthern Europe storytelling, featured in German, Irish (e.g.,Dullahan), Scandinavian (e.g.,the Wild Hunt), and British legends, and included inRobert Burns's Scots poem ""Tam o' Shanter"" (1790) andGottfried August Bürger'sDer Wilde Jäger(1778), translated asThe Wild Huntsman(1796). Usually viewed as omens of ill fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions, these specters found their victims in proud, scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance.[3]One particularly influential rendition of this folktale is the last of the ""Legenden von Rübezahl"" ('Legends ofRübezahl') fromJohann Karl August Musäus's literary retellings of German folktales,Volksmärchen der Deutschen(1783).[4]

After theBattle of White Plainsin October 1776, the country south of theBronx Riverwas abandoned by theContinental Armyand occupied by theBritish. The Americans were fortified north ofPeekskill, leavingWestchester Countya 30-mile stretch of scorched and desolated no-man's-land, vulnerable to outlaws, raiders, and vigilantes. Besides droves of Loyalist rangers and British light infantry, HessianJägers—renowned sharpshooters and horsemen—were among the raiders who often skirmished with Patriot militias.[5]The Headless Horseman may have indeed been based loosely on the discovery of such a corpse found inSleepy Hollowafter a violent skirmish and later buried by the Van Tassel family in an unmarked grave in theOld Dutch Burying Ground.[6]Two possible inspirations for the Headless Horseman were two actual incidents during the October 1776 Battles of White Plains: Lt Abraham Ondernock of the Orange County Militia, was beheaded by a cannonball; during the battle of Chatterton Hill One of the veterans of the battle, Gen. William Heath, noted in his journal that he witnessed a Hessian artilleryman lose his head on October 31st.[7]

According to another hypothesis, Irving could have drawn the figure of the ""headless rider"" from German Silesian literature, precisely from the Chronicle ofSprottau(since 1945 Polish Szprotawa) by J.G. Kreis, written in the first half of the 19th century. In the 19th century, the police counselor Kreis noted that, in the previous century, the inhabitants of this city were afraid to move after dusk onHospitalstrasse(now Sądowa Street) due to the headless rider apparition seen there.[8]In support of the hypothesis, according to information inPolish Reception of Washington Irving's Work: Between Enlightenment and Romanticismby Zofia Sinko,Walter Scottencouraged Irving to learn German to be able to read stories, ballads, and legends in their native language.[9]

Irving, while he was anaide-de-campto New York GovernorDaniel D. Tompkins, met an army captain namedIchabod CraneinSackets Harbor, New York, during an inspection tour of fortifications in 1814. Irving may have patterned the character afterJesse Merwin, who taught at the local schoolhouse inKinderhook, further north along theHudson River, where Irving spent several months in 1809.[10]Alternatively, it is claimed by many inTarrytownthatSamuel Youngsis the individual from whom Irving drew his character.[11]AuthorGary Dennissasserts that while Crane is loosely based on Merwin, it may include elements from Youngs's life.[12]

With ""Rip Van Winkle"", ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is one of Irving's most anthologized, studied, and adapted sketches. Both stories are often paired together in books and other representations, and both are included in surveys of earlyAmerican literatureandRomanticism.[13]Irving's depictions ofregional cultureand themes of progress versus tradition,supernaturalintervention in the commonplace, and theplight of the individual outsider in a homogeneous communitypermeate both stories and helped develop a unique sense of American cultural and existential selfhood during the early 19th century.[14]

Sleepy Hollow, New York, as the setting for the story, contains many of the referenced locations, including ones that can still be visited today.Sleepy Hollow, Illinois;Sleepy Hollow, Marin County, California; andSleepy Hollow, Wyoming, have street names that reference the story. The latter hosts an annual event called Sleepy Hollow Days.[39]There is also aSleepy Hollow State ParkinLaingsburg, Michigan. The original schoolhouse inKinderhook, New York, is now owned by theColumbia County Historical Societyand called theIchabod Crane Schoolhouse.[40]The area's modern-day school district,Ichabod Crane Central School District, is also named for the character."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/110,Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_of_the_d%27Urbervilles,"Tess Durbeyfield, a country girl of 16, is the eldest child of John Durbeyfield, a haggler, and his wife Joan. When the localparsontells John that ""Durbeyfield"" is a corruption of ""D'Urberville"" and that he is descended from an ancientNormanfamily, John celebrates by getting drunk. Tess drives to market in her father's place, but falls asleep at the reins; the wagon crashes and the family's only horse is killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to visit Mrs d'Urberville, a rich widow, to ""claim kin"", unaware that the widow's late husband Simon Stoke had adopted the surname to distance himself from his tradesman's roots.

Alec d'Urberville, the son, is attracted to Tess and finds her a job as his mother's poultry keeper. Tess resists Alec's manipulative attentions. One night, on the pretence of rescuing her from a fight, Alec takes her on his horse to a remote spot, and it is implied that he rapes her.[2]

The following summer, Tess gives birth to a sickly boy. Unable to find a parson prepared to christen a child born out of wedlock, Tess attempts to do it herself, naming her dying child Sorrow.

Some years later, Tess finds employment as amilkmaidat Talbothays Dairy, where her past is unknown. She falls in love with Angel Clare, an apprenticegentleman farmerwho is studying dairy management.

Angel's father, James Clare, a clergyman, is surprised that his son wishes to marry a milkmaid but makes no objection, understanding Tess to be a pure and devout country maiden.

Feeling she has no choice but to conceal her past, Tess is reluctant to accept Angel's marriage proposal, but eventually agrees. She later tries several times to tell Angel of her history, but he says that they can share confidences after the wedding.

The couple spend their wedding night at an old d'Urberville mansion. When Angel confesses that he once had a brief affair with an older woman, Tess tells him about Alec, sure now he will understand and forgive.

Angel is appalled. Tess is not the pure maiden he took her for, and although he concedes she was ""more sinned against"" than sinning, he feels that her ""want of firmness"" amounts to a character flaw. The couple separate after a few days. Tess returns home while Angel travels to Brazil to try farming there.

Tess's family soon exhaust the funds Angel has given her, and she is forced to take field work at thestarve-acrefarm of Flintcomb-Ash.

Alec d'Urberville continues to pursue Tess although she is already married. When Tess learns from her younger sister 'Liza-Lu that her parents are ill, she rushes home. Her mother recovers but her father dies, and the destitute family is evicted from their home. Alec tells Tess that her husband will never return, and he offers to house the Durbeyfields on his estate. She refuses.

Angel's farming venture fails, he repents of his treatment of Tess, and he decides to return to England.

After a long search, Angel finds Tess elegantly dressed and living in aboarding housein the fashionable seaside resort ofSandbourne, under the name of ""Mrs d'Urberville"". In anguish, Tess tells him he has arrived too late. Angel reluctantly leaves.

Tess and Alec argue, and Tess leaves the house. Sitting in her parlour beneath the d'Urbervilles' rented rooms, the landlady notices a spreading red spot – a bloodstain – on the ceiling. Tess has stabbed Alec to death in his bed.

Tess chases after Angel and tells him of the deed. The couple find an empty house and stay there for five days in blissful, loving seclusion before being forced to move to evade capture. In the night, they stumble uponStonehenge. Tess asks Angel to marry and look after 'Liza-Lu when she is gone. She sleeps on an ancient stone altar. At dawn, while Tess sleeps, Angel sees they are surrounded. Tess's final words on waking are ""I am ready.""

Angel and 'Liza-Lu look down at 8 a.m. from a nearby hill over the town ofWintoncesteras a black flag that signals Tess's execution is raised over the prison. Angel and 'Liza-Lu go on their way hand in hand.

Hardy's writing often explores what he called the ""ache of modernism"", a theme notable inTess, which as one critic noted, Hardy draws on imagery associated with hell to describe modern farm machinery and suggests the effete nature of city life as milk sent there must be watered down before townspeople can stomach it.[3]

On the other hand, the Marxist criticRaymond WilliamsinThe English Novel from Dickens to Lawrencequestions the identification of Tess with a peasantry destroyed byindustrialization. Williams sees Tess not as a peasant, but as an educated member of the rural working class, who suffers a tragedy through being thwarted in her hopes to rise socially and desire for a good life (which includes love and sex), not by industrialism, but by the landed bourgeoisie (Alec), liberal idealism (Angel) and Christian moralism in her family's village (see Chapter LI). Earlier commentators were not always appreciative.Henry JamesandRobert Louis Stevensonin Bournemouth ""loved to talk of books and bookmen. Stevenson, unlike James, was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, but wrote to James expressing his violent reaction toTess of the D'Urbervilles;James wrote back agreeing the book was 'vile' (not a word used by Stevenson).

Because of the numerouspaganand neo-Biblicalreferences made about her, Tess has been seen variously as an Earth goddess or a sacrificial victim.[4]

Tess has been seen as a personification of nature, an idea supported by her ties with animals throughout the novel. Tess's misfortunes begin when she falls asleep while driving Prince to market and causes the horse's death; at Trantridge she becomes a poultry-keeper; she and Angel fall in love amid cows in the fertile Froom valley; on the road to Flintcomb-Ash, she kills some wounded pheasants to end their suffering.[5]

However, Tess emerges as a powerful character not through this symbolism but because ""Hardy's feelings for her were strong, perhaps stronger than for any of his other invented personages.""[6]

When Hardy was 16, he saw the hanging ofElizabeth Martha Brown, who had murdered a violent husband. This fascinating, yet repellent experience contributed to the writing ofTess.[7][8]

The moral commentary running through the novel insists thatTessis not at fault, instead imposing mythological, biblical and folk imagery on a story of a young girl seduced and abandoned to create a ""challenging contemporaneity"".[9]It was controversial and polarizing, setting these elements in a context of 19th-century English society, including disputes in the Church, theNational Schoolmovement, the overall class structure of English society, and changing circumstances of rural labour. During the era offirst-wave feminism, civil divorce was introduced and campaigns were waged against child prostitution, moving gender and sexuality issues to the forefront of public discussion. Hardy's work was criticized as vulgar, but by the late 19th century other experimental fiction works were released such asFlorence Dixie's depiction offeminist utopia,The Story of an African FarmbyOlive Schreiner, andSarah Grand's workThe Heavenly Twins. These raised awareness ofsyphilisand advocated sensitivity rather than condemnation for young women infected with it.[10]

Hardy's description leaves it unclear whether Alec d’Urberville rapes Tess or whether he seduces her, and the issue has been the subject of debate.[2][11]

Mary Jacobus, a commentator on Hardy's works, speculates that the rape/seduction ambiguity may have been forced on the author to meet publisher requirements and the ""Grundyist"" readership of his time.[12]

The novel was adapted for the stage in 1897. The production by Lorimer Stoddard proved a Broadway triumph for actressMinnie Maddern Fiskewhen it opened on 2 March 1897.[13]Acopyright performancewas given atSt James's Theatrein London on the same date.[14]It was revived in America in 1902 and then made into a motion picture byAdolph Zukorin 1913, starring Mrs. Fiske; no copies remain.

In the UK, an adaptation,Tess, by H. Mountford, opened at theGrand TheatreinBlackpoolon 5 January 1900.[14]

Tess, a different stage adaptation by H. A. Kennedy, premièred at theCoronet Theatrein London'sNotting HillGate on 19 February 1900.[14]Mrs Lewis Waller (Florence West) played the title role, with William Kettridge as Angel Clare and Whitworth Jones as Alec Tantridge.[15]The play transferred to theComedy Theatrefor 17 performances from 14 April 1900 with a slightly different cast, includingFred Terryas Alec andOswald Yorkeas Angel.[16]Hardy wrote to the Times stating that he had played no part in the dramatisation, did not authorise its production and did not know how the play unfolded, other than by what he had read in the papers.[17]

In 1924, Hardy wrote a British theatrical adaptation and choseGertrude Bugler, aDorchestergirl from the original Hardy Players to play Tess.[18]The Hardy Players (re-formed in 2005) was an amateur group from Dorchester that re-enacted Hardy's novels. Bugler was acclaimed,[19]but prevented from taking the London stage part by the jealousy of Hardy's wifeFlorence;[citation needed]Hardy had said that young Gertrude was the true incarnation of the Tess he had imagined. Years before writing the novel, Hardy had been inspired by the beauty of her mother Augusta Way, then an 18-year-old milkmaid, when he visited Augusta's father's farm inBockhampton. When Hardy saw Bugler (he rehearsed The Hardy Players at the hotel run by her parents), he immediately recognised her as a young image of the now older Augusta.[18]

The novel was successfully adapted for the stage several more times:

1906: An Italian operatic version written byFrederic d'Erlangerwas first performed in Naples, but the run was cut short by an eruption ofMount Vesuvius. When the opera came to London three years later, Hardy, then 69, attended the premiere.

The story has also been filmed at least eight times, including three for general release through cinemas and four television productions."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16,Peter Pan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy,"The play and its novelisation differ in some details of the story, but have much in common. In both versions, Peter Pan[a]makes night-time calls on the Darlings' house inBloomsbury,[4]listening in on Mrs.Mary Darling's bedtime stories by the open window. One night Peter is spotted and, while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On returning to claim it, Peter accidentally wakes Mary's daughter, Wendy. She succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him using thread and needle, and Peter learns that she knows many bedtime stories. He invites her toNeverlandto be a mother to his gang, theLost Boys, children who were lost when they fell out of their prams. Wendy agrees, and her younger brothers John and Michael go along.

After their magical flight to Neverland, the children are blown out of the air by a pirate cannon and Wendy is nearly shot and killed by the Lost BoyTootles, because Peter's fairy companion, Tinker Bell, is jealous of her and tricks him into thinking that she is a bird. The only reason that Wendy is spared is because she is protected by an acorn pendant she wears around her neck given to Wendy by Peter in exchange for a ""kiss"" (actually a thimble) she gave him. Peter and the Lost Boys build a little house for Wendy to live in while she recuperates.[b]Soon John and Michael adopt the ways of the Lost Boys and all three of the Darling siblings begin to forget their parents and home.

Peter welcomes Wendy to his underground home, and she assumes the role of mother figure. Peter takes the Darlings on several adventures. At Mermaids' Lagoon, Peter and the Lost Boys save the Native chief's daughter,Tiger Lily, from Marooner's Rock and become involved in a battle with the pirates, includingCaptain Hook, Peter's nemesis. He is named after the hook that replaced his right hand that Peter cut off in a fight. From thereon, Hook has been hunted by the crocodile which ate his hand after it fell into the water and now wants to eat the rest of him. The crocodile also swallowed a ticking clock, so Hook is wary of all ticking sounds. Peter is wounded when Hook claws him. He believes he will die, as the tide rises and Marooner's Rock will become submerged. However, ""the Neverbird"", a nearby mother bird, allows him to use her nest as a boat and Peter sails home.

In gratitude for Peter saving Tiger Lily, her tribe guards his home from the next imminent pirate attack. Meanwhile, Wendy begins to fall in love with Peter and asks him what kind of feelings he has for her. Peter says that he has ""the feelings of a devoted son"", disappointing Wendy. One day, while telling stories to the Lost Boys and her brothers, Wendy recalls her parents and decides to return to England. Unbeknownst to Peter, Wendy and the boys are captured by Captain Hook, who massacres the natives and poisons Peter's ""medicine"" while the boy is asleep. When Peter awakes, he learns fromTinker Bellthat Wendy has been kidnapped – in an effort to please Wendy, he goes to drink his medicine. Peter does not believe Tink about the poison (as he is confident the pirate could not have entered their secret lair without him noticing), so instead she drinks it herself, causing her near death. Tink says that she could be saved if children believed in fairies. In the play, Peterturns to the audienceand begs those who believe in fairies to clap their hands. In the novel, Peter speaks to all the children currently asleep and dreaming of the Neverland.

En route to the ship, Peter encounters the crocodile, which is silent and Peter concludes the clock must have run down; Peter decides to copy the creature's tick, so any animals will recognise it and leave him unharmed. He does not realise that he is still mimicking the ticking as he boards the ship, where Hook and his crew cower, mistaking him for the crocodile. While the pirates search for the creature, Peter sneaks into the cabin to steal the keys and frees the Lost Boys. When the pirates investigate a noise in the cabin, Peter defeats them. When Peter reveals himself, he and Hook begin to battle, and Peter easily wins. He kicks Hook into the jaws of the waiting crocodile, and Hook dies with the satisfaction that Peter literally kicked him off the ship, which Hook considers ""bad form"". Peter takes control of the ship, and sails the seas back to London.

Before Wendy and her brothers arrive at their house, Peter flies ahead, to try and bar the window so Wendy will think her mother forgot her. However, after learning of Mrs. Darling's distress, he bitterly leaves the window open and flies away. The Darlings reunite with their parents. Wendy then presents all the lost boys to her parents, who decide to adopt them. Peter returns briefly, and meets Mrs. Darling. She offers to adopt Peter as well, but Peter refuses, afraid they will ""catch him and make him a man."" It is hinted that Mary knew Peter when she was a girl; she always has a kiss in the corner of her mouth no one can reach, but Peter takes it with him as he leaves.

Peter promises to return for Wendy and take her to Neverland for a week every spring. The play's final scene takes place a year later when Wendy is preparing to return there, after the spring cleaning has taken place. Tinker Bell has died during this year since fairies are short-lived creatures. However, Peter has already forgotten about Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and even Hook when Wendy returns, and he does not understand Wendy's wistful wish that she could take him back with her.

Four years after the premiere of the original production ofPeter Pan, Barrie wrote an additional scene entitledWhen Wendy Grew Up, An Afterthought, later included in the final chapter ofPeter and Wendy, and later still published as a separate work in 1957.[5]

In this scene, Peter returns for Wendy years later, but she is now grown up with a daughter of her own named Jane. It is also revealed that Wendy married a Lost Boy, although this is not mentioned in the novel, and it is never revealed which one she did marry.[c]When Peter learns that Wendy ""betrayed"" him by growing up, he is heartbroken until Jane agrees to come to Neverland as Peter's new mother. In the novel it is mentioned that when Jane grows up, Peter takes her daughter Margaret to Neverland. This cycle will go on forever as long as children are ""gay and innocent and heartless"".[d]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27673,Oedipus King of Thebes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex,"Oedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law,Creon, to ask the advice of the oracle atDelphi, concerning a plague ravaging Thebes. Creon returns to report that the plague is the result of religious pollution, since the murderer of their former king,Laius, has never been caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for causing the plague.

Oedipus summons the blind prophetTiresiasfor help.  Tiresias admits to knowing the answers to Oedipus's questions, but he refuses to speak, instead telling Oedipus to abandon his search. Angered by the seer's reply, Oedipus accuses him of complicity in Laius's murder. The offended Tiresias then reveals to the king that ""you yourself are the criminal you seek"". Oedipus does not understand how this could be, and supposes that Creon must have paid Tiresias to accuse him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias's lack of sight, and Tiresias retorts that Oedipus himself is blind. Eventually, the prophet leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered, he shall be a native of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.

Creon arrives to face Oedipus's accusations. The King demands that Creon be executed; however, thechoruspersuades him to let Creon live.Jocasta, wife of first Laius and then Oedipus, enters and attempts to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take no notice of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received anoraclewhich never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; instead, Laius was killed by bandits, at afork in the road(τριπλαῖς ἁμαξιτοῖς, triplais amaxitois).

The mention of the place causes Oedipus to pause and ask for more details. Jocasta specifies the branch toDaulison the way toDelphi. Recalling Tiresias's words, he asks Jocasta to describe Laius. The king then sends for a shepherd, the only surviving witness of the attack to be brought from his fields to the palace.

Confused, Jocasta asks Oedipus what the matter is, and he tells her. Many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a man drunkenly accused Oedipus of not being his father's son. Oedipus went to Delphi and asked the oracle about his parentage. Instead of answering his question directly, the oracle prophesied that he would one day murder his father and sleep with his mother. Upon hearing this, Oedipus resolved never to return to Corinth. In his travels, he came to the very crossroads where Laius had been killed, and encountered a carriage that attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued, and Oedipus killed the travelers—including a man who matched Jocasta's description of Laius. However, Oedipus holds out hope that he was not Laius's killer, because Laius was said to have been murdered byseveralrobbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus will be in the clear.

A man arrives fromCorinthwith the message thatPolybus, who raised Oedipus as his son, has died. To the surprise of the messenger, Oedipus is overjoyed, because he can no longer kill his father, thus disproving half of the oracle's prophecy. However, he still fears that he might somehow commit incest with his mother.  Eager to set the king's mind at ease, the messenger tells him not to worry, because Merope is not his real mother.

The messenger explains that years earlier, while tending his flock onMount Cithaeron, a shepherd from the household of Laius brought him an infant that he was instructed to dispose of.  The messenger had then given the child to Polybus, who raised him. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows the identity of the other shepherd, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who witnessed the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, realizing the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions.  When Oedipus refuses, the queen runs into the palace.

When the shepherd arrives, Oedipus questions him, but he begs to be allowed to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius's own son.  In fear of a prophecy that the child would kill his father, Jocasta gave her son to the shepherd in order to beexposedupon the mountainside.

Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and following this, a servant exits the palace to speak of what has happened inside. Jocasta hashanged herselfin her bedchamber. Entering the palace in anguish, Oedipus called on his servants to bring him a sword, that he might slay Jocasta with his own hand. But upon discovering the lifeless queen, Oedipus took her down, and removing the long gold pins from her dress, he gouged out his own eyes in despair.

The blinded king now exits the palace, and begs to beexiled. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be consulted regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus's two daughters (and half-sisters),AntigoneandIsmene, are sent out and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He begs Creon to watch over them, in hopes that they will live where there is opportunity for them, and to have a better life than their father. Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.

On an empty stage, the chorus repeats the common Greekmaximthat ""no man should be considered fortunate until he is dead.""[11]

The two cities ofTroyandThebeswere the major focus of Greekepic poetry. The events surrounding theTrojan Warwere chronicled in theEpic Cycle, of which much remains, and those about Thebes in theTheban Cycle, which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house ofLaius, of which the story of Oedipus is a part.

Homer'sOdyssey(XI.271ff.) contains the earliest account of the Oedipus myth whenOdysseusencounters Jocasta (named Epicaste) in theunderworld. Homer briefly summarises the story of Oedipus, including the incest, patricide, and Jocasta's subsequent suicide. However, in the Homeric version, Oedipus remains King of Thebes after the revelation and neither blinds himself, nor is sent into exile. In particular, it is said that the gods made the matter of his paternity known, whilst inOedipus the King, Oedipus very much discovers the truth himself.[12]

In 467 BC, Sophocles's fellow tragedianAeschyluswon first prize at theCity Dionysiawith a trilogy about the House of Laius, comprisingLaius,OedipusandSeven Against Thebes(the only play which survives). Since he did not write connected trilogies as Aeschylus did,Oedipus Rexfocuses on the titular character while hinting at the larger myth obliquely, which was already known to the audience in Athens at the time.

The trilogy containingOedipus Rextook second prize in theCity Dionysiaat its original performance. Aeschylus's nephewPhiloclestook first prize at that competition.[13]However, in hisPoetics,AristotleconsideredOedipus Rexto be the tragedy which best matched his prescription for how drama should be made.[14]

Many modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality ofOedipus Rex, even if they don't always agree on the reasons. For example,Richard Claverhouse Jebbclaimed that ""TheOedipus Tyrannusis in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.""[15]Cedric Whitmannoted that ""theOedipus Rexpasses almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play"".[16]Whitman himself regarded the play as ""the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,"" that is the conception of tragedy as a ""revelation of the evil lot of man,"" where a man may have ""all the equipment for glory and honor"" but still have ""the greatest effort to do good"" end in ""the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible.""[17]Edith Hallreferred toOedipus the Kingas ""this definitive tragedy"" and notes that ""the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,"" and notes the irony that ""Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.""[18]H. D. F. Kittosaid aboutOedipus Rexthat ""it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,"" although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order ""is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.""[19]

The science revolution attributed toThalesbegan gaining political force, and this play offered a warning to the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles's retort to thesophists, by dramatizing a situation in which humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, the fact that they have been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension.[20]Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares ""that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so much that we cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.""[20]

Oedipus Rexis widely regarded as one of the greatest plays, stories, and tragedies ever written.[21][22]The Guardian'stheatre criticMichael Billingtonincluded it in his list of the 101 greatest plays ever written.[23]

Fateis a motif that often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. Likewise, where the attempt to avoid an oracle is the very thing that enables it to happen is common to many Greek myths. For example, similarities to Oedipus can be seen in the myth ofPerseus'sbirth.

Two oracles in particular dominate the plot ofOedipus Rex. Jocasta relates the prophecy that was told toLaiusbefore the birth of Oedipus (lines 711–4):

The oracle told to Laius tells only of thepatricide, whereas theincestis missing. Prompted by Jocasta's recollection, Oedipus reveals the prophecy which caused him to leaveCorinth(lines 791–3):"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/161,Sense and Sensibility,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility,"On his deathbed, Henry Dashwood gets John, his son by his first wife, to promise to take care of his stepmother and half-sisters,Elinor,Marianneand Margaret, from his inheritance. But Fanny, John's wife, persuades her husband not to support them financially, leaving them to survive on a greatly reduced income.

Fanny’s brotherEdward Ferrarscomes on a visit, but when Elinor and he seem to be growing close, Fanny warns Mrs Dashwood that Edward is destined for higher things by their mother. Affronted by this, Mrs Dashwood decides to move her family to Barton Cottage inDevonshire, which has been offered her at a low rent by her second cousin, Sir John Middleton. Later, while dining with the Middletons at Barton Park, Marianne attracts the attention of a family friend, Colonel Brandon. However, he is aged thirty-five, which seems much too old to the romantic sensibility of sixteen-year-old Marianne.

Marianne sprains her ankle out walking, but is carried home by John Willoughby, who sees her fall. During subsequent visits their similar artistic tastes cause the girl to fall in love with him, abandoning caution and propriety. Just as an engagement seems imminent, however, Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his elderly cousin Mrs. Smith, upon whom he is financially dependent due to his debts, is sending him toLondonindefinitely on business, leaving Marianne distraught.

When Edward Ferrars pays a visit to Barton Cottage, he seems subdued. Shortly afterwards, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Sir John’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, come to stay at Barton Park. While there, Lucy forces on Elinor the secret of her prior engagement to Edward, giving Elinor an insight into Lucy's jealous and calculating nature.

Mrs Jennings invites the elder Dashwood sisters on a visit to London. After Marianne’s letters to Willoughby go unanswered, they meet later at a dance. Willoughby is with another woman and greets Marianne coldly, later informing her of his engagement to the rich Miss Grey. Marianne is very upset but admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby never were actually engaged.

Colonel Brandon now reveals to Elinor that Willoughby had earlier seduced and abandoned Brandon's teenaged ward, Eliza Williams. Willoughby's cousin has consequently disinherited him, which explains his need to marry an heiress. Meanwhile, the Steele sisters come to London and are invited to stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house in preference to Elinor and Marianne. On account of their cordiality, Anne believes that the Ferrars have become fond enough of Lucy to welcome her into the family and betrays to them Lucy's engagement to Edward. As a result, the sisters are dismissed from the house, and Edward is ordered by his wealthy mother to break off the engagement. When Edward refuses, he is disinherited in favour of his younger brother. On learning this, Colonel Brandon shows his admiration for Edward’s honourable conduct by offering him the clerical living of a nearby parsonage, so as to enable him to marry Lucy after he is ordained.

Mrs. Jennings now takes the Dashwood sisters to visit her second daughter as they make their way back to Devonshire. Marianne goes walking in the rain and her life is endangered by contractingputrid fever. When Elinor writes home, Colonel Brandon, who lives nearby, volunteers to go and bring back Marianne's mother. That night too, Willoughby arrives and reveals to Elinor that his love for Marianne had been genuine. However, the callous way in which he talks of Eliza and his wife lessens her pity for him.

Marianne recovers from her illness and, learning of Elinor’s own silent heartache, becomes ashamed of her ostentatious grief, vowing to be guided by her sister’s good sense and amend her behaviour in future.

After their return home, a family servant meets Lucy passing through the nearbymarket townand brings them the message that she has married and is now Mrs Ferrars. This final act of spite becomes obvious when Edward arrives to reveal that Lucy had jilted him and married his now wealthy brother. After ordaining, Edward marries Elinor, while Marianne later marries Colonel Brandon. The two sisters can now live as neighbours and in harmony with each other.

Jane Austen wrote the first draft of the novel inepistolary form, perhaps as early as 1795 when she was about 19 years old; or 1797, at age 21. She is said to have given it the working titleElinor and Marianne. Later she changed the form to a narrative and the title toSense and Sensibility.[3]

Austen drew inspiration forSense and Sensibilityfrom other novels of the 1790s that treated similar themes, including Adam Stevenson'sLife and Love(1785) which he had written about himself and a relationship that was not meant to be.Jane West'sA Gossip's Story(1796), which features one sister full of rational sense and another sister of romantic, emotive sensibility, is considered to have been an inspiration as well. West's romantic sister-heroine also shares her first name, Marianne, with Austen's. There are further textual similarities, described in a modern edition of West's novel.[4]

Austen may have drawn on her knowledge ofWarren Hastings, the firstGovernor-General of India, in her portrayal ofColonel Brandon. Just as Eliza Brandon was rumoured to be the Colonel’s love child, Hastings had been rumoured to be the biological father of Austen's cousinEliza de Feuillide. Linda Robinson Walker argues that Hastings ""hauntsSense and Sensibilityin the character of Colonel Brandon"": both left for India at the age of seventeen; Hastings may have had an illegitimate daughter named Eliza; both Hastings and Brandon participated in a duel.[5]

Early reviews ofSense and Sensibilityfocused on the novel as providing lessons in conduct (which would be debated by later critics), as well as reviewing the characters. TheNorton Critical EditionofSense and Sensibilitycontains a number of such responses in its supplementary material. An ""Unsigned Review"" in the February 1812Critical Reviewpraises the novel as well-written and realistic, with well-drawn characters and a ""highly pleasing"" plot in which ""the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing"".[6]Elinor and her mother are praised, while Marianne's extreme sensibility is seen as bringing unhappiness on herself.[6]

Another ""Unsigned Review"" from the May 1812British Criticfurther emphasises the novel's function as a type of conduct book. In this author's opinion, Austen's favouring of Elinor's temperament over Marianne's provides the lesson.[6]The reviewer claims that ""the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life, of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand, and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other.""[6]He goes on to state that the book contains ""many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life"" within a ""very pleasing and entertaining narrative.""[6]

W. F. Pollock's 1861 article forFrasier's Magazine,on ""British Novelists"" is described as an ""early example of what would become the customary view ofSense and Sensibility.""[7]In addition to emphasising the novel's morality, Pollock reviews the characters in catalogue-like fashion, allotting praise and criticism on the assumption that Austen favours Elinor's point of view and temperament.[7]and extending it to the minor characters. Mrs Palmer is silly, Sir John Dashwood is selfish, the behaviour of the Steele sisters is vulgar.[7]However, an anonymous piece titled ""Miss Austen"" published in 1866 inThe Englishwoman's Domestic Magazinedeparts from other early criticism in sympathising with Marianne over Elinor, claiming that Elinor is ""too good"" a character.[8]The article also differs from other reviews in its claim that the ""prevailing merit"" of the book is not in its sketch of the two sisters; rather, the book is effective because of its ""excellent treatment of the subordinate characters.""[8]Alice Meynell's 1894 article ""The Classic Novelist"" in thePall Mall Gazettealso concurs with Austen's attention to small things and minor characters and small matters since ""that which makes life, art, and work trivial is a triviality of relations.""[9]Also discussed is the children's function in highlighting ""the folly of their mothers"", especially in Lady Middleton's case.[9]

As used by Austen, the word ""sense"" signifies good judgment, wisdom, or prudence, and ""sensibility"" signifies sensitivity, sympathy, or emotionality. By changing the title from the names of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in her first choice of title to that of their qualities, Austen adds ""philosophical depth"" to what began as a sketch of two characters.[10]However, these characteristics, as demonstrated through the dominant behaviour of the sisters, are not mutually exclusive. Although their qualities are compared and contrasted through means of the plot, neither sister is a one-sided caricature. Humanised through emotional suffering, Marianne's sympathy for her sister teaches her self-control and prudence, while Elinor learns to express her emotions more overtly.[11]

Nevertheless, the changes to the original novel's structure are never resolved in the eyes of some critics.A. Walton Litzjudged thatSense and Sensibilityis ""caught uneasily between burlesque and the serious novel…in which the crude antitheses of the original structure were never successfully overcome"".Tony Tannersees a shift of view instead to ""the tensions between the potential instability of the individual and the required stabilities of society"", as demonstrated by the influence of the governing qualities on the younger and the older sister. While sensibility has its positive aspects, its over-cultivation leads in the novel to thepsychosomatic disordersto which Marianne nearly succumbs.[12]

Claire Tomalintoo argues thatSense and Sensibilityhas a ""wobble in its approach"", which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph.[13]Austen characterises Marianne as a sweet person with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending.[14]

InRachel Brownstein’s opinion, the differences between the Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having an ""excellent heart"" and being capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels, while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite, and less impulsive than Marianne, who loves poetry, taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is this very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges.[15]

Mary Favret explores the contrast through examining popular forms of fiction of the time.[16]Inepistolary fiction, action, dialogue, and character interactions are all reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In exploring Austen's fraught relationship with such fiction, Favret surveys how Austen ""wrestled with epistolary form"" in previous writings and, with the publication ofSense and Sensibility, ""announced her victory over the constraints of the letter"". Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her ""admired predecessor,Samuel Richardson"" in that Austen's letters are ""a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting.""[16]According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an ""anti-epistolary heroine"" whose ""inner world"" of thoughts and feelings does not find ""direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story.""[16]Sense and Sensibilityestablishes what Favret calls a ""new privacy"" in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters.[16]This new privacy is a ""less constraining mode of narration"" in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters.[16]Favret claims that inSense and Sensibility, Austen wants to ""recontextualize"" the letter and bring it into a ""new realism.""[16]Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter ""prove false"".[16]Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses the correspondence of both of the sisters to emphasise the contrasts in their personalities.[16]When both write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the ""dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'"" and Marianne writes a ""vaguely illicit letter"" reflecting her characterisation as the ""sensitive"" sister"".[16]What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other.[16]

A common theme of Austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family, particularly wills, the rights of first and second sons, and lines of inheritance. Gene Ruoff's bookJane Austen's Sense and Sensibilityexplores these issues in an extended discussion of the novel. The first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance. These topics reveal what Ruoff calls ""the cultural fixation on priority of male birth"".[17]According to Ruoff, male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations. Ruoff observes that, within the linear family, the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit.[17]When Robert Ferrars becomes his mother's heir, Edward is no longer appealing to his ""opportunistic"" fiancée Lucy, who quickly turns her attention to the foppish Robert and ""entraps him"" in order to secure the inheritance for herself.[17]Ruoff comments that Lucy is specifically aiming for the heir because of the monetary advantage.[17]William Galperin, in his bookThe History Austen,comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of women.[18]Because of this vulnerability, Galperin contends thatSense and Sensibilityshowsmarriageas the only practical solution ""against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman.""[18]

Feministcritics have long been engaged in conversations about Jane Austen, andSense and Sensibilityhas figured in these discussions, especially in the context of the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning. Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminalfeministworkThe Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imaginationcontains several discussions of this novel. The authors read the beginning ofSense and Sensibilityas a retelling ofKing Learfrom a female perspective and contend that these ""reversals imply that male traditions need to be evaluated and reinterpreted from a female perspective.""[19]Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on women, particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance. InSense and Sensibilitythey educe the fact that Mr. John Dashwood cuts off his stepmother and half sisters from their home as well as promised income, as an instance of these effects. They also point to the ""despised"" Mrs. Ferrars's tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her elder son, Edward Ferrars, as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary.[19]Gilbert and Gubar contend that whileSense and Sensibility's ultimate message is that ""young women like Marianne and Elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding a male protector"", women such as Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele demonstrate how women can ""themselves become agents of repression, manipulators of conventions, and survivors.""[19]In order to protect themselves and their own interests, Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele must participate in the same patriarchal system that oppresses them.

In the chapter ""Sense and Sensibility:Opinions Too Common and Too Dangerous"", from her bookJane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel,Claudia Johnsonalso gives a feminist reading ofSense and Sensibility.She differs from previous critics, especially the earliest ones, in her contention thatSense and Sensibilityis not, as it is often assumed to be, a ""dramatized conduct book"" that values ""female prudence"" (associated with Elinor's sense) over ""female impetuosity"" (associated with Marianne's sensibility).[20]Rather, Johnson seesSense and Sensibilityas a ""dark and disenchanted novel"" that views ""institutions of order"" such as property, marriage, and family in a negative light, an attitude that makes the novel the ""most attuned to social criticism"" of Austen's works.[20]According to Johnson,Sense and Sensibilitycritically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community.[20]Key to Austen's criticism of society, runs Johnson's argument, is the depiction of the unfair marginalisation of women resulting from the ""death or simple absence of male protectors.""[20]Additionally, the male characters inSense and Sensibilityare depicted unfavourably. Johnson calls the gentlemen inSense and Sensibility""uncommitted sorts"" who ""move on, more or less unencumbered by human wreckage from the past.""[20]Johnson compares Edward to Willoughby in this regard, claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical; Johnson calls them both ""weak, duplicitous, and selfish,"" lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which Austen endows other ""exemplary gentlemen"" in her work.[20]

Mary Poovey's analysis inThe Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works ofMary Wollstonecraft,Mary Shelleyand Jane Austenconcurs with Johnson's on the dark tone ofSense and Sensibility.Poovey contends thatSense and Sensibilityhas a ""somber tone"" in which conflict breaks out between Austen's engagement with her ""self-assertive characters"" and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially ""anarchic"" desires.[21]Austen shows, according to Poovey, this conflict between individual desire and the restraint of moral principles through the character of Elinor herself.[21]Except for Elinor, all of the female characters inSense and Sensibilityexperience some kind of female excess. Poovey argues that while Austen does recognise ""the limitations of social institutions"", she demonstrates the necessity of controlling the ""dangerous excesses of female feeling"" rather than liberating them.[21]She does so by demonstrating that Elinor's self-denial, especially in her keeping of Lucy Steele's secret and willingness to help Edward, even though both of these actions were hurtful to her, ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of others.[21]In this way, Poovey contends that Austen suggests that the submission to society that Elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life.

The new discipline ofEcocriticismextends the examination of imbalance in Austen’s novels and finds that she ""antedated Victorian novelists in predicting early signs of environmental manipulation and identifying the attitudes and practices that led to the ecological collapse of early nineteenth century England"".[22]Susan Rowland's article ""The 'Real Work': Ecocritical Alchemy and Jane Austen'sSense and Sensibility"" studies the effects of alienation upon Edward Ferrars and Marianne Dashwood. Edward feels out of place in society because he lacks what Rowland calls ""useful employment"".[23]His condition underlines the historical problem of labour in Western industrialised societies. Edward's alienation also represents ""the progressive estrangement from nonhuman nature""[23]in modern society as a whole, only resolved in his case by becoming a ""pastor"". Rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it, serving merely through the fact of ownership to bolster their place in the social order. Marianne’s emotional estrangement begins as she is ripped from the aesthetic enjoyment of her home environment, although ultimately she finds a new identity by uniting with Colonel Brandon on his estate at Delaford.[23]

In 1811, Thomas Egerton of the Military Library publishing house in London accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes. Austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher a commission on sales. The cost of publication was more than a third of Austen's annual household income of £460 (about £15,000 in 2008 currency).[24]She made a profit of £140 (almost £5,000 in 2008 currency)[24]on the first edition, which sold all 750 printed copies by July 1813. A second edition was advertised in October 1813.

Sense and Sensibilitywas the first Austen title to be republished in England after her death, and the first illustrated Austen book produced in Britain, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series of 1833.[25]The novel has been in continuous publication since 1811, and has many times been illustrated, excerpted, abridged, and adapted for stage, film, and television.[26]

The novel was soon translated into French by MadameIsabelle de MontolieuasRaison et Sensibilité, ou les deux manières d'aimer(1815).[27]Montolieu had only the most basic knowledge of English, and her translations were more ""imitations"" of Austen's novels as Montolieu had her assistants provide a summary of Austen's novels, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters.[27]The ""translation"" ofSense and Sensibilityby Montolieu changes entire scenes and characters, for example having Marianne call Willoughby an ""angel"" and an ""Adonis"" upon first meeting him, lines that are not in the English original.[28]Likewise, the scene where Mrs Dashwood criticises her husband for planning to subsidise his widowed stepmother because it might be disadvantageous to ""our little Harry"", Mrs Dashwood soon forgets about Harry and it is made apparent her objections are founded in greed; Montolieu altered the scene by having Mrs Dashwood continuing to speak of ""our little Harry"" as the basis of her objections, completely changing her motives.[29]When Elinor learns the Ferrars who married Lucy Steele is Robert, not Edward, Montolieu adds a scene, in which Edward, the Dashwood sisters and their mother all break down in tears while clasping hands, that was not in the original.[30]Austen has the marriage of Robert Ferrars and Lucy Steele end well while Montolieu changes the marriage into a failure.[31]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36,The War of the Worlds,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds,"The novel opens in the mid-1890s, with aliens onMarsplotting aninvasion of Earthbecause their own world is becoming uninhabitable due to cooling and old age. The main narrative (""The Great Disillusionment"") takes place in the early 20th century, in the summer, when an object thought to be ameteorlands onHorsell Common, near the narrator's home. It turns out to be an artificial cylinder that was launched towards Earth several months earlier as Earth and Mars approachedopposition. Several Martians emerge and appear to struggle with Earth's gravity and unfamiliar atmosphere. When a human delegation approaches the cylinder waving awhite flag, the Martians incinerate them using a heat ray. The crowd flees, and that evening a large military force surrounds the cylinder.

The next day, the narrator takes his wife to safety inLeatherheadby means of adog-cartrented from the local pub landlord but then turns back so that he can return it. That night, he sees a three-legged Martian""fighting-machine""(tripod), armed with a heat-ray and achemical weapon: the poisonous ""black smoke"". Tripods have wiped out the human soldiers around the cylinder and destroyed most ofWoking. The narrator approaches his own house and finds the landlord dead in the front garden from inhaling the black smoke. While keeping watch from an upper floor window, he offers shelter to anartillerymanwho has fled after his battery was wiped out attacking the cylinder. The narrator and the artilleryman try to escape back towards Leatherhead but are separated during a Martian attack betweenSheppertonandWeybridge. As refugees try to cross theRiver Wey, the army is able to destroy a tripod with concentrated artillery fire, and the Martians retreat. The narrator travels toWalton, where he meets an unnamedcurate.

The Martians attack again, and people begin to flee London, including the narrator's brother, who travels with his neighbor, Mrs. Elphinstone, and her sister-in-law to keep them safe. They reach the coast and buy passage toContinental Europeon a makeshift fleet of refugee ships. Tripods attack, but atorpedo ram,HMSThunder Child, destroys two of them before being destroyed itself (a third is either destroyed in the detonation of the ship's ammunition stores, or flees unseen in the resultant smoke), and the evacuation fleet escapes. Soon, all organised resistance collapses, and Martians roam the shattered landscape unhindered.

At the beginning of Book Two, the narrator and the curate witness a Martian machine seizing people and tossing them into a metal carrier. The narrator realises that the Martian invaders may have plans for their victims. When a fifth Martian cylinder lands, both men are trapped beneath the ruins of a manor house. The narrator learns from his observations how Martian anatomy works and how they use living creatures' blood to nourish themselves. The two men's relationship deteriorates as the curate slowly falls into despair, and when he tries to eat their remaining food supplies, the narrator knocks him unconscious. A passing Martian removes the curate's body, but the narrator escapes detection.

The Martians abandon the cylinder's crater, and the narrator emerges from the collapsed house and heads for West London. En route, he finds Martianred weedeverywhere, prickly vegetation spreading wherever there is abundant water, but notices that it is slowly dying. OnPutney Heath, he encounters the artilleryman again, but soon abandons him when the man tries to convince him that they should keep on fighting the Martians. Driven mad by his trauma, he finally attempts suicide by approaching a stationary fighting machine onPrimrose Hill. To his surprise, he discovers that all the Martians have been killed by an onslaught of earthlypathogens, to which they had no immunity.

The narrator suffers anervous breakdownand is nursed back to health by a kind family. Eventually, he returns to Woking, and discovers that his wife has survived. In the last chapter, he reflects on the Martian invasion, its impact on humanity's view of itself and the future, and the effect that it has had on his mind.

The War of the Worldspresents itself as a factual account of the Martian invasion. It is one of the first works to theorise the existence of a race intelligent enough to invade Earth. The narrator is a middle-class writer of philosophical papers, reminiscent of Doctor Kemp inThe Invisible Man, with characteristics similar to author Wells at the time of writing.[citation needed]The reader learns little about the background of the narrator or indeed of anyone else in the novel. In fact, few of the principal characters are named, aside from the astronomer Ogilvy and Mrs. and Miss Elphinstone.[8]

Wells explained that he was exposed to the scenario of an empty and depopulated London almost simultaneously by a friend during a conversation and through the novelA Sensational Trance, by Forbes Dawson. Being attracted to the idea about writing a similar story himself, he tried to come up with a reason for why London was empty, and concluded the one that made the most sense was a mass exodus. When thinking about what could have caused the flight, he suddenly remembered his brother's idea about superior beings from another planet suddenly dropping from the sky. Wells' sonAnthony Westclaimed another seed for the novel can be found inThe Time Machine, where the narrator speculates about the possible future evolution of humanity, thinking it might could have ""developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful"". Next, the picture came to him that the aliens would arrive in interplanetary cylinders, an idea he borrowed from Jules Verne's stories about spaceflight. When deciding from what planet, he picked Mars, both because it was the one most similar to Earth, and because scientists back then wrongly assumed Mars was older than Earth, and therefore the Martians would have a longer evolutionary history than humans, having evolved into much more advanced creatures.[9]

Wells was trained as a science teacher during the latter half of the 1880s. One of his teachers wasThomas Henry Huxley, a major advocate ofDarwinism. Wells later taught science, and his first book was a biology textbook.[10][11]Much of his work makes  contemporary ideas of science and technology easily understandable.[12]

The scientific fascinations of the novel are established in the opening chapter. The narrator views Mars through a telescope, and Wells offers the image of the superior Martians having observed human affairs, as though watching tiny organisms through a microscope. In August 1894, a French astronomer reported sightings of a ""strange light"" on Mars.[13]Wells used this observation to open the novel, imagining these lights to be the launching of the Martian cylinders toward Earth.[8]

Italian astronomerGiovanni Schiaparelliobserved features on Mars in 1878, which he calledcanali(Italian for ""channels""). In 1895, American astronomerPercival Lowellspeculated in his bookMarsthat these might be irrigation channels, constructed by a sentient life form to support existence on an arid, dying world.[8][14]The novel also explores ideas related toCharles Darwin's theory ofnatural selection.[15]

In 1896, Wells published an essay on 'Intelligence on Mars' in theSaturday Review, setting out ideas about life on Mars. Wells speculates on the nature of Martian inhabitants and how their evolutionary progress might compare to humans.[16][17]These ideas are used almost unchanged inThe War of the Worlds.[8][16]

In 1895, Wells married Catherine Robbins, and moved with her toWokingin Surrey. There, he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the countryside, and his afternoons writing. He used these bicycle tours to find places he would refer to in his novel. He wrote in his autobiography that he “wheeled about the district marking down suitable places and people for destruction by my Martians”.[18][19]A 23 feet (7.0 m) high sculpture of a tripod fighting machine, entitledThe Woking Martian, based on descriptions in the novel stands in Crown Passage close to the local railway station in Woking, designed and constructed in 1998 by artist Michael Condron. Fifty meters further up thepedestrianised streetis a concrete and brick representation of a Martian cylinder.[20]

Wells's depiction of late Victorian suburban culture in the novel was an accurate representation of his own experiences at the time.[21]In the late 19th century, theBritish Empirewas the predominant colonial power on the globe, making its domestic heart a poignant and terrifying starting point for an invasion by Martians with their own imperialist agenda.[22]Wells also drew on a common fear that emerged in the years approaching the turn of the century, known as thefin de siècleor 'end of the age', which anticipated an apocalypse occurring at midnight on the last day of 1899.[3]

In the late 1890s it was common for novels to be serialised in magazines or newspapers before publication in full, with each part of the serialisation ending on acliffhangerto entice audiences to buy the next issue. This practice was familiar fromCharles Dickens' novels earlier in the 19th century.The War of the Worldswas first serialised in the United Kingdom inPearson's Magazinefrom April to December 1897.[23]Wells was paid £200 and Pearsons demanded to know the ending of the piece before committing to publish it.[24]The complete volume was first published byHeinemannin 1898 and has been in print ever since,[25]although several editions exist. The 1924 Atlantic edition is considered the definitive text used for reprints. In addition, a revised version for schools was first published by Heinemann in 1951.[26]

Two unauthorised serialisations of the novel were published in the United States prior to publication of the novel. The first was in theNew York Evening Journalwhere the story was published asFighters from Marsor the War of the Worlds, located in a New York setting, between December 1897 and January 1898.[27]The second version had the Martians landing near and aroundBoston, and was published byThe Boston PostasFighters from Mars, or the War of the Worlds in and near Bostonin 1898.[10]Even though these versions are considered unauthorised, Hughes and Geduld speculate that Wells may inadvertently have agreed to the serialisation in theNew York Evening Journal.[2]These two versions of the story were followed byEdison's Conquest of MarsbyGarrett P. Serviss.

Holt, Rinehart & Winstonreprinted the book in 2000, paired withThe Time Machine, and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate a new cover.[28]

The War of the Worldswas received favourably by both readers and critics.The Illustrated London Newswrote that the serialisation inPearson’s magazinehad ""a very distinct success"".[29]The story did even better as a book, and reviewers rated it as ""the very best work he has yet produced"",[29]and highlighting the story's originality in showing Mars in a new light through the concept of an alien invasion of Earth.[29]Writing forHarper's Weekly, Sidney Brooks admired Wells's writing style: ""he has complete check over his imagination, and makes it effective by turning his most horrible of fancies into the language of the simplest, least startling denomination"".[29]Praising Wells's ""power of vivid realization"",The Daily Newsreviewer wrote, ""the imagination, the extraordinary power of presentation, the moral significance of the book cannot be contested"".[29]There was, however, some criticism of the brutal nature of the events in the narrative.[30]

Between 1871 and 1914 more than 60 works of fiction for adult readers describing invasions of Great Britain were published. The original work wasThe Battle of Dorking(1871) byGeorge Tomkyns Chesney, which portrays a surprise German attack and landing on the south coast of England, made possible by the distraction of theRoyal Navyin colonial patrols and the army in an Irish insurrection. The German army makes short work of English militia and rapidly marches to London. This story was published inBlackwood's Magazinein May 1871 and was so popular that it was reprinted a month later as a pamphlet which sold 80,000 copies.[31][32]

There are clear plot similarities between Wells's book andThe Battle of Dorking. In both, a ruthless enemy makes a devastating surprise attack, with the British armed forces helpless to stop its relentless advance; and both involve the destruction of theHome Countiesof Southern England.[32]However,The War of the Worldstranscends the typical fascination ofinvasion literaturewith European politics and international disputes, with its introduction of an alien adversary.[33]

The invasion literature genre provided a familiar base from which to support the success ofThe War of the Worlds. It may also have proved an important foundation for Wells's ideas, as he had never seen or fought in a war.[34]

Many novels focusing on life on other planets written close to 1900 echoscientificideas of the time, includingPierre-Simon Laplace'snebular hypothesis,Charles Darwin'sscientific theoryofnatural selection, andGustav Kirchhoff's theory ofspectroscopy. These ideas combined to present the possibility that planets are alike in composition and conditions for the development of species, which would likely lead to the emergence of life at a suitable geological age in a planet's development.[35]

By the time Wells wroteThe War of the Worlds, there had been three centuries of observation of Mars through telescopes.Galileoobserved the planet's phases in 1610 and in 1666Giovanni Cassiniidentified the polar ice caps.[14]In 1878 Italian astronomerGiovanni Schiaparelliobserved geological features which he calledcanali(Italian for ""channels""). This was mistranslated into English as ""canals"" which, being artificial watercourses, fuelled the belief in intelligent extraterrestrial life on the planet. This influenced American astronomerPercival Lowell.[36]In 1895 Lowell's bookMarsspeculated about an arid, dying landscape, whose inhabitants built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. This encapsulated contemporary scientific ideas about conditions on the Red Planet at the timeThe War of the Worldswas written; ideas which persisted until they were tested by space missions, starting with theViking program, that found a lifeless world that was too cold for liquid water to exist.[14]

The Martians travel to the Earth incylinders, apparently fired from a hugespace gunon the surface of Mars. This was a common representation of space travel in the 19th century, and had also been used byJules VerneinFrom the Earth to the Moon. Modern scientific understanding renders this idea impractical, as it would be difficult to control the trajectory of the gun precisely, and the force of the explosion necessary to propel the cylinder from the Martian surface to the Earth would likely kill the occupants.[37]

The Martian invasion's principal weapons are the Heat-Ray and the poisonous Black Smoke. Their strategy includes the destruction of infrastructure such as armament stores, railways, and telegraph lines; it appears to be intended to cause maximum casualties, leaving humans without any will to resist. These tactics became more common as the 20th century progressed, particularly during the 1930s with the development of mobile weapons and technology capable ofsurgical strikeson key military and civilian targets.[38]

Wells's vision of a war bringing total destruction without moral limitations inThe War of the Worldswas not taken seriously by readers at the time of publication. He later expanded these ideas in the novelsWhen the Sleeper Wakes(1899),The War in the Air(1908), andThe World Set Free(1914). This kind oftotal wardid not become fully realised until theSecond World War.[39]

Critic Howard Black wrote that ""In concrete details the Martian Fighting Machines as depicted by Wells have nothing in common withtanksordive bombers, but the tactical and strategic use made of them is strikingly reminiscent ofBlitzkriegas it would be developed by the German armed forces four decades later. The description of the Martians advancing inexorably, at lightning speed, towards London; the British Army completely unable to put up an effective resistance; the British government disintegrating and evacuating the capital; the mass of terrified refugees clogging the roads, all were to be precisely enacted in real lifeat 1940 France."" Black regarded this 1898 depiction as far closer to the actual land fighting of World War II than Wells's much later workThe Shape of Things to Come(1933).[40]

Wells's description of chemical weapons – the Black Smoke used by the Martian fighting machines to kill human beings in great numbers – became a reality inWorld War I.[23]The comparison betweenlasersand the Heat-Ray was made as early as the later half of the 1950s when lasers were still in development. Prototypes of mobile laser weapons have been developed and are being researched and tested as a possible future weapon in space.[38]

Military theorists of the era, including those of theRoyal Navyprior to theFirst World War, had speculated about building a ""fighting-machine"" or a ""landdreadnought"". Wells later further explored the ideas of anarmoured fighting vehiclein his short story ""The Land Ironclads"".[41]There is a high level of science fiction abstraction in Wells's description of Martian automotive technology; he stresses how Martian machinery is devoid of wheels. They use ""a complicated system of sliding parts"" to produce movement, possess multiple whip-like tentacles for grasping, and paralleling animal motion, ""quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling machine"".[42]

H. G. Wells was a student ofThomas Henry Huxley, a proponent of the theory ofnatural selection.[43]In the novel, the conflict between humankind and the Martians is portrayed as asurvival of the fittest, with the Martians whose longer period of successful evolution on the older Mars has led to them developing a superior intelligence, able to create weapons far in advance of humans on the younger planet Earth, who have not had the opportunity to develop sufficient intelligence to construct similar weapons.[43]"

This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure andpicaresquenovels, which tend to employ such adramatic structure.[45]By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in theAmericas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and theOttoman Empire.[46][47]The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.

The tale ofCandidebegins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh inWestphalia, home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cunégonde; hisbastardnephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; achambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. Theprotagonist, Candide, is romantically attracted to Cunégonde. He is a young man of ""the most unaffected simplicity"" (l'esprit le plus simple), whose face is ""the true index of his mind"" (sa physionomie annonçait son âme).[2]Dr. Pangloss, professor of ""métaphysico-théologo-cosmolonigologie"" (English: ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"") and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the ""best of all possible worlds"" and that ""all is for the best"".

All is well in the castle until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured byBulgar(Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he isflogged, nearlyexecuted, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (anallegoryrepresenting the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, anAnabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar withsyphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cunégonde wasrapedbefore her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail toLisbon.

In Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard.[48]The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the ""brutish sailor"" who let Jacques drown[49]survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit byan earthquake, tsunami, and firethat kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.

The next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of thePortuguese Inquisition, and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an ""auto-da-fé"" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman,[50]who leads him to a house where Lady Cunégonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cunégonde had been raped anddisemboweled. She had been, but Cunégonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corruptGrand Inquisitorinto sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cunégonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and thesabbath day). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas.[51]Along the way, Cunégonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her.

The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter ofPope Urban Xand the Princess ofPalestrina, she was kidnapped and enslaved byBarbary pirates, witnessed violent civil wars inMoroccounder the bloodthirsty kingMoulay Ismaïl(during which her mother wasdrawn and quartered), suffered constant hunger, nearly died from aplagueinAlgiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starvingJanissariesduring theRussian capture of Azov. After traversing all theRussian Empire, she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cunégonde.

The trio arrives inBuenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, analcalde(a Spanish magistrate) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees toParaguaywith his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.

At aborder poston the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to thecommandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, theJesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order.[51]When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with hisrapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.

Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of theIncanobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.[52]

After a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander intoEl Dorado, a geographically isolatedutopiawhere the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny.[53]Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.

Candide and Cacambo eventually reachSurinamewhere they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.

This companion, Martin, is aManichaeanscholarbased on the real-life pessimistPierre Bayle, who was a chief opponent of Leibniz.[54]For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour toBordeauxandParis, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based onAdmiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time ""pour encourager les autres"" (to encourage the others).[55]Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival inVenice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with aTheatinemonk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object since she was forced to become a prostitute, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousandpiastresto Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.

Candide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo—now a slave—arrives and informs Candide that Cunégonde is inConstantinople. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for theCarnival of Venice. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman SultanAhmed III, EmperorIvan VI of Russia,Charles Edward Stuart(an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne),Augustus III of Poland(deprived, at the time of writing, of his reign in theElectorate of Saxonydue to theSeven Years' War),Stanisław Leszczyński, andTheodore of Corsica.

On the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes on the banks of thePropontisas a slave for a fugitiveTransylvanianprince by the name ofRákóczi. After arriving at theBosphorus, they board agalleywhere, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices.[51]They both relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: ""I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and sincepre-established harmonyis the most beautiful thing in the world, along with theplenumandsubtle matter.""[56]

Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm (une petite métairie) which he just bought with the last of his finances.

One day, the protagonists seek out adervishknown as a great philosopher of the land. Candide asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Candide is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet aTurkwhose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them ""free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.""[57]Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this ""commendable plan"" (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him ""we must cultivate our garden"" (il faut cultiver notre jardin).[57]

As Voltaire himself described it, the purpose ofCandidewas to ""bring amusement to a small number of men of wit"".[2]The author achieves this goal by combining wit with a parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death ""as coolly as a weather report"".[58]The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again.[59]In the end,Candideis primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, ""short, light, rapid and humorous"".[10][60]

Behind the playful façade ofCandidewhich has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for theirInquisition, and the British for the execution ofJohn Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated inCandide. For example, Voltaire mocks theJesuit orderof theRoman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while inParaguay, Cacambo remarks, ""[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all …"". Here, Voltaire suggests theChristian mission in Paraguayis taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.[61][62]

The main method ofCandide's satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy.[10]The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.[59]ThusCandidederides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.[2][58]

A simple example of the satire ofCandideis seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin inPortsmouthharbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to representJohn Byng, being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely ""to encourage the others"" (French:pour encourager les autres, an expression Voltaire is credited with originating). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation ""to encourage the others"" thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted fromCandide.[10][63]

Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all ofCandideis a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode ofEl Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.[2][58]

Another element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works onCandide, calls the ""sentimental foibles of the age"" and Voltaire's attack on them.[64]Flaws in European culture are highlighted asCandideparodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking the style of apicaresque novel.[64][65]A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the driftingrogueof lowsocial class, Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor, and Cacambo the skillful valet.[2]As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters ofCandideare unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and evenmarionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical.[66]As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is abildungsroman, if not a very serious one.[2][67]

Gardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role inCandide. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion asAdam and Eveare evicted from theGarden of Edenin theBook of Genesis. Cyclically, the main characters ofCandideconclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent ""garden"" isEl Dorado, which may be a false Eden.[68]Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.[69]

These gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to theEncyclopédie, and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate ""his garden"" symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported theEncyclopédie: the main characters ofCandidelive in seclusion to ""cultivate [their] garden"", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in theepistolarycorrespondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing theEncyclopédie.[69]Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating ""his garden"" suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates inLes DélicesandFerney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.[70][71][72]

Candidesatirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these isLeibnizian optimism(sometimes calledPanglossianismafter its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity.[10]Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil—specifically the theological problem of
its existence—is the focus of the work.[73]Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder—evils of human design—are explored as extensively inCandideas are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is ""comprehensive"" in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.[74]

Fundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/600,Notes from the Underground,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_Underground,"The novella is divided into two parts. The title of the first part—""Underground""—is itself given a footnoted introduction by Dostoevsky in which the character of the 'author' of the Notes and the nature of the 'excerpts' are discussed.

The first part ofNotes from Undergroundhas eleven sections:

The narrator observes that utopian society removes suffering and pain, but man desires both things and needs them in order to be happy. He argues that removing pain and suffering in society takes away a man's freedom. He says that the cruelty of society makes human beings moan about pain only to spread their suffering to others.

Unlike most people, who typically act out of revenge because they believe justice is the end, the Underground Man is conscious of his problems and feels the desire for revenge, but he does not find it virtuous; the incongruity leads to spite towards the act itself with its concomitant circumstances. He feels that others like him exist, but he continuously concentrates on his spitefulness instead of on actions that would help him avoid the problems that torment him. The main issue for the Underground Man is that he has reached a point ofennui[7](boredom) and inactivity.[8]He even admits that he would rather be inactive out of laziness.

The first part also gives a harsh criticism ofdeterminism, as well as of intellectual attempts at dictating human action and behavior by logic, which the Underground Man discusses in terms of the simple math problem:two times two makes four(cf.necessitarianism). He argues that despite humanity's attempt to create a utopia where everyone lives in harmony (symbolized byThe Crystal PalaceinNikolai Chernyshevsky'sWhat Is to Be Done?), one cannot avoid the simple fact that anyone, at any time, can decide to act in a way that might not be considered to be in their own self-interest; some will do so simply to validate their existence and to protest and confirm that they exist as individuals. The Underground Man ridicules the type ofenlightened self-interestthat Chernyshevsky proposes as the foundation of Utopian society. The idea of cultural and legislative systems relying on thisrational egoismis what the protagonist despises. The Underground Man embraces this ideal inpraxis, and seems to blame it for his current state of unhappiness.[9]

The title of Part 2 is an allusion to the criticPavel Annenkov's observation that ""damp showers and wet snow"" were indispensable to writers of thenatural schoolin Petersburg.[10]Following the title there is an epigraph containing the opening lines fromNekrasov's poem ""When from the darkness of delusion..."" about a woman driven to prostitution by poverty. The quotation is interrupted by an ellipsis and the words ""Etc., etc., etc.""[10]

Part 2 consists of ten sections covering some events from the narrator's life. While he continues in his self-conscious, polemical style, the themes of his confession are now developed anecdotally.

The first section tells of the Underground Man's obsession with an officer who once insulted him in a pub. This officer frequently passes him by on the street, seemingly without noticing his existence. He sees the officer on the street and thinks of ways to take revenge, eventually borrowing money to buy an expensive overcoat and intentionally bumping into the officer to assert his equality. To the Underground Man's surprise, however, the officer does not seem to notice that it even happened.

Sections II to V focus on a going-away dinner party with some old school friends to bid farewell to one of these friends—Zverkov—who is being transferred out of the city. The Underground Man hated them when he was younger, but after a random visit to Simonov's, he decides to meet them at the appointed location. They fail to tell him that the time has been changed to six instead of five, so he arrives early. He gets into an argument with the four of them after a short time, declaring to all his hatred of society and using them as the symbol of it. At the end, they go off without him to a secret brothel, and, in his rage, the underground man follows them there to confront Zverkov once and for all, regardless if he is beaten or not. He arrives at the brothel to find Zverkov and the others already retired with prostitutes to other rooms.  He then encounters Liza, a young prostitute.

The remaining sections deal with his encounter with Liza and its repercussions. The story cuts to Liza and the Underground Man lying silently in the dark together. The Underground Man confronts Liza with an image of her future, by which she is unmoved at first, but after challenging her individual utopian dreams (similar to his ridicule of the Crystal Palace in Part 1), she eventually realizes the plight of her position and how she will slowly become useless and will descend more and more, until she is no longer wanted by anyone. The thought of dying such a terribly disgraceful death brings her to realize her position, and she then finds herself enthralled by the Underground Man's seemingly poignant grasp of the destructive nature of society. He gives her his address and leaves.

He is subsequently overcome by the fear of her actually arriving at his dilapidated apartment after appearing such a ""hero"" to her and, in the middle of an argument with his servant, she arrives. He then curses her and takes back everything he said to her, saying he was, in fact, laughing at her and reiterates the truth of her miserable position. Near the end of his painful rage he wells up in tears after saying that he was only seeking to have power over her and a desire to humiliate her. He begins to criticize himself and states that he is in fact horrified by his own poverty and embarrassed by his situation. Liza realizes how pitiful he is and tenderly embraces him. The Underground Man cries out ""They—they won't let me—I—I can't be good!""

After all this, he still acts terribly toward her, and, before she leaves, he stuffs a five ruble note into her hand, which she throws onto the table (it is implied that the Underground Man had sex with Liza and that the note is payment). He tries to catch her as she goes out to the street, but he cannot find her and never hears from her again. He tries to stop the pain in his heart by ""fantasizing.""

He recalls this moment as making him unhappy whenever he thinks of it, yet again proving the fact from the first section that his spite for society and his inability to act makes him no better than those he supposedly despises.

The concluding sentences recall some of the themes explored in the first part, and he tells the reader directly, ""I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you have not dared to carry even halfway.”

At the end of Part 2, a further editorial note is added by Dostoevsky, indicating that the 'author' couldn't help himself and kept writing, but that ""it seems to us that we might as well stop here"".

The narration by the Underground Man is laden with ideological allusions and complex conversations regarding the political climate of the period. Using his fiction as a weapon ofideological discourse, Dostoevsky challenges the ideologies of his time, mainlynihilismand rational egoism.[9]The novel rejects the rationalist assumptions which underlieJeremy Bentham'sutilitariansocial philosophy.[11]

In Part 2, the rant that the Underground Man directs at Liza as they sit in the dark, and her response to it, is an example of such discourse. Liza believes she can survive and rise up through the ranks of her brothel as a means of achieving her dreams of functioning successfully in society. However, as the Underground Man points out in his rant, such dreams are based on a utopian trust of not only the societal systems in place, but also humanity's ability to avoid corruption and irrationality in general. The points made in Part 1 about the Underground Man's pleasure in being rude and refusing to seek medical help are his examples of how idealised rationality is inherently flawed for not accounting for the darker and more irrational side of humanity.

TheStone Wallis one of the symbols in the novella and represents all the barriers of thelaws of naturethat stand against man and his freedom. Put simply, the rule thattwo plus two equals fourangers the Underground Man because he wants the freedom to saytwo plus two equals five, but that the Stone Wall of nature's laws stands in front of him and his free will.

In the1860s, Russia was beginning to absorb the ideas and culture of Western Europe at an accelerated pace, nurturing an unstable local climate. There was especially a growth in revolutionary activity accompanying a general restructuring oftsardomwhereliberal reforms, enacted by an unwieldy autocracy, only induced a greater sense of tension in both politics and civil society. Many of Russia's intellectuals were engaged in a debate with theWesternizerson one hand, and theSlavophileson the other, concerned with favoring importation of Western reforms or promoting pan-Slavic traditions to address Russia's particular social reality. AlthoughTsar Alexanderemancipated the serfs in 1861, Russia was still very much a post-medieval, traditionalpeasant society.

WhenNotes from Undergroundwas written, there was an intellectual ferment on discussions regarding religious philosophy and various 'enlightened' utopian ideas.[12]The work is a challenge to, and a method of understanding, the larger implications of the ideological drive toward a utopian society.[13]Utopianism largely pertains to a society's collective dream, but what troubles the Underground Man is this very idea ofcollectivism. The point the Underground Man makes is that individuals will ultimately always rebel against a collectively imposed idea of paradise; a utopian image such as The Crystal Palace will always fail because of the underlying irrationality of humanity.

Although the novella is written infirst-person narrative, the ""I"" is never really discovered. Thesyntaxcan at times seem ""multi-layered""; thesubjectand theverbare often at the very beginning of the sentence before theobjectgoes into the depths of the narrator's thoughts. The narrator repeats many of his concepts.[14]

In chapter 11, the narrator refers to his inferiority to everyone around him and describes listening to people as like ""listening through a crack under the floor."" The word ""underground"" actually comes from a bad translation into English. A better translation would be acrawl space: a space under the floor that is not big enough for a human, but where rodents and bugs live. According toRussian folklore, it is also a place where evil spirits live.[citation needed]

The challenge posed by the Underground Man towards the idea of an ""enlightened"" society laid the groundwork for later writing. The work has been described as ""probably the most important single source of the moderndystopia.""[15]

Notes from Undergroundhas had an impact on various authors and works in the fields of philosophy, literature, and film, including:[16]

SinceNotes from Undergroundwas first published in Russian, there have been a number of translations into English over the years, including:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/105,Persuasion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion_(novel),"The story begins seven years after the broken engagement of Anne Elliot to Frederick Wentworth: having just turned nineteen years old, Anne fell in love and had accepted a proposal of marriage from Wentworth, then a young and as yet undistinguished naval officer. Wentworth was considered clever, confident and ambitious, but his low social status and lack of wealth made Anne's friends; her vain father, Sir Walter Elliot; and her older sister Elizabeth view him as an unsuitable match for the daughter of abaronet. Lady Russell, a distant relative whom Anne had considered a second mother since the death of her own, also saw the relationship as imprudent for one so young and persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Lady Russell are the only family members who knew about the short engagement, as Anne's younger sister, Mary, was away at school.

Several years later, the Elliot family are in financial trouble on account of Sir Walter's lavish spending; this had been kept in check while Lady Elliot was alive, but since then Sir Walter and Elizabeth have spent without thought. At last, forced into action, they are persuaded to rent out Kellynch Hall, the family estate, and settle inBathuntil their finances improve. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's new companion, Mrs Clay, look forward to the move. Anne, on the other hand, doubts she will enjoy Bath, but cannot go against her family. Mary is now married to Charles Musgrove of Uppercross Hall, the heir to a respected localsquire. Anne visits Mary and her family, where she is well-loved. As theNapoleonic Warsare over, Admiral Croft and his wife Sophia (Frederick's sister) become the new tenants of Kellynch Hall. Captain Wentworth, now wealthy fromprize shipshe captured in the war, visits his sister and meets the Uppercross family, where he crosses paths with Anne.

The Musgroves, including Mary, Charles, and Charles's sisters Henrietta and Louisa, welcome the Crofts and Captain Wentworth, who makes it clear that he is ready to marry. Both the Crofts and the Musgroves enjoy speculating about which sister Captain Wentworth might marry. The Musgroves' cousin, the young clergyman Charles Hayter, who is absent when Wentworth is introduced to their social circle, returns and is rather upset over Henrietta's apparent interest in Wentworth after Hayter's wooing of her. However, when Charles Hayter stops visiting so often, Henrietta realises where her true affections lie, and now it seems that a match between Louisa and Wentworth will soon follow. Anne still loves Wentworth, so each meeting with him requires preparation for her own strong emotions. She overhears a conversation in which Louisa tells Wentworth that before marrying Mary, Charles Musgrove first proposed to Anne, who turned him down. This news startles Wentworth, and Anne realises that he has not yet forgiven her for letting herself be persuaded to end their engagement years ago.

Anne and the young adults of the Uppercross family accompany Captain Wentworth on a visit to see two of his fellow officers, Captains Harville and Benwick, in the coastal town ofLyme Regis. Captain Benwick is in mourning over the death of his fiancée, Captain Harville's sister Fanny, and he appreciates Anne's sympathy and understanding, helped by their mutual admiration for theRomantic poets. At Lyme, Anne attracts the attention of a young man they later learn is William Elliot, her cousin and a wealthy widower who is heir to Kellynch Hall; he broke ties with his family years earlier, and was reported to have spoken of Sir Walter and Elizabeth in very disrespectful terms. On the last morning of the visit, Louisa sustains a serious concussion after willfully insisting on jumping from the Cobb seawall a second time, expecting to be caught again by Wentworth; he first tries to dissuade her from such a big jump but she is determined and jumps a fraction of a second before Wentworth is ready. Anne organises others to summon assistance. Wentworth is impressed with Anne's quick thinking and cool-headedness, but feels guilty about his actions concerning Louisa; he now sees that his encouraging her to never allow anyone to persuade her to anything was a serious error, resulting in her serious injury. This causes him to re-examine his feelings for Anne. Louisa, due to her delicate condition, is forced to recover at the Harvilles' home in Lyme for months. Captain Benwick, who was a guest as well, helps in Louisa's recovery by attending and reading to her.

Following Louisa's accident, Anne joins her father and sister in Bath, with Lady Russell also in the city. Captain Wentworth visits his older brother Edward in Shropshire. Anne finds that her father and sister are flattered by the attentions of their cousin William Elliot, thinking that if he marries Elizabeth, the family fortunes will be restored. William flatters Anne and offhandedly mentions that he was ""fascinated"" with the name of his future wife already being an ""Elliot"" who would rightfully take over for her late mother, but teasingly refuses to tell her who had talked fondly of her to him in the past. Although Anne wants to like William, the attention and his refined manners, she finds his character opaque and difficult to judge.

Admiral Croft and his wife arrive in Bath with the news that Louisa is engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth travels to Bath, where his jealousy is piqued by seeing William courting Anne. Anne visits Mrs Smith, an old school friend, who is now a widow living in Bath under straitened circumstances, and in the early days of recovery from serious illness. From her, Anne discovers that she was the person who spoke fondly of her to her former friend, William Elliott. She reveals that beneath William's charming veneer is a cold, calculating opportunist who led Mrs Smith's late husband into debt. He had frequently obtained money from the good-natured but easily manipulated Mr Smith before William's marriage to a very wealthy woman, who has since died. However, when Mr Smith became ill, William made no attempt to aid his friend. Named as the executor to Mr Smith's will before the Smiths learned that William was no true friend, William has done nothing to help Mrs Smith. She needs someone to act for her in regards to a property of her husband's, which she is too ill to deal with herself, and too poor to employ someone to do it for her. She asked William to act for her, but he made it clear he had no intention of doing anything. Although Mrs Smith believes that William is genuinely attracted to Anne, she feels that his initial aim was to prevent Mrs Clay from marrying Sir Walter — rumours abound in Bath that this is Mrs Clay's aim, along with astonishment that Elizabeth does not realise this — as a new marriage might mean a son for Sir Walter, displacing William as heir to Kellynch Hall. The discovery that the young lady he had admired in Lyme is his cousin Anne is a wonderful bonus for William.

The Musgroves visit Bath to purchase wedding clothes for Louisa and Henrietta, both soon to marry. Captains Wentworth and Harville encounter them and Anne at the Musgroves' hotel in Bath, where Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville discussing the relative faithfulness of men and women in love. Deeply moved by what Anne says about women not giving up their feelings of love even when all hope is lost, Wentworth writes her a note declaring his feelings for her. Outside the hotel, Anne and Wentworth reconcile, reaffirm their love for each other, and renew their engagement. Lady Russell admits she was wrong about Wentworth and endorses the engagement. William leaves Bath; Mrs Clay soon follows him and becomes his mistress, making it more likely that he will inherit Kellynch Hall as the danger of her marrying Sir Walter has passed. Once Anne and Wentworth have married, Wentworth helps Mrs Smith recover her remaining assets. Anne settles into her new life as the wife of a Navy captain.

Anne Elliot– The second daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is intelligent, accomplished and attractive, and is unmarried at 27, having broken off seven years earlier her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, then a naval commander. Anne fell in love with Wentworth but was persuaded by her late mother's friend, Lady Russell, to reject his proposal because of his uncertain prospects and lack of money, and Anne's youth. Anne rejects Charles Musgrove's proposal a few years later, knowing she still loves Wentworth, but it is only when Wentworth returns from fighting abroad that she finally confronts her unfulfilled feelings for him.

Captain Frederick Wentworth– A naval officer, about 31 years old, who proposed to Anne some seven years earlier. At the time, he had no fortune and uncertain prospects, but owing to his achievements in theNapoleonic Wars, he advanced in rank and in fortunes. He is one of Sophia Croft's two brothers. He gained his step topost Captain, and gained wealth amounting to about £25,000 fromprize moneyawarded for capturing enemy vessels. He is an eminently eligible bachelor, eager to settle down with a good woman.

Sir Walter Elliot, Bt.– A vain and self-satisfiedbaronet. Sir Walter is a man whose extravagance since the death of his prudent wife thirteen years before has put his family into dire financial straits, forcing him to lease his estate, Kellynch Hall, to Admiral Croft and rent a more economical residence in Bath. Despite being strongly impressed by wealth and status, he allows Mrs Clay, who is beneath him in social standing, to join his household as a companion to his eldest daughter.

Elizabeth Elliot– The eldest and most beautiful of Sir Walter's three daughters, who appears to be his favourite. Elizabeth encourages her father's imprudent spending and extravagance and like her father, she has a tendency to be narcissistic, while she herself desires marriage after spending most of her life managing the family home in her mother's place. She and her father regard Anne as inconsequential, wanting to ensure only that she marries a man who can enhance the Elliot family's social standing.

Mary Musgrove– The youngest daughter of Sir Walter, married to Charles Musgrove. Mary is attention-seeking, always looking for ways she might have been slighted, and often claims illness when she is upset. She is just as obsessed with social standing and wealth as the rest of her family, and opposes sister-in-law Henrietta's interest in marrying a cousin, Charles Hayter, whom Mary feels is unworthy of being married to a woman of means.

Charles Musgrove Jr.– Son of Charles Musgrove Sr. Husband of Mary and heir to the Musgrove estate. He first proposes to Anne, who refuses as she does not love him. He marries Mary about five years before the story opens, and they have two sons. He is a cheerful man, who loves hunting and endures his wife's faults.

Lady Russell– An intimate friend of the late Lady Elliot and the godmother of Anne, of whom she is particularly fond. She is instrumental in Sir Walter's decision to leave Kellynch Hall and avoid financial ruin. She values social rank and finds in Anne the Elliot daughter most like her late friend, which led her to persuade the young Anne not to marry Wentworth seven years earlier on account of his lack of wealth.

Penelope Clay– A poor widow with children, daughter of Sir Walter's lawyer, and companion of Elizabeth Elliot. She aims to flatter Sir Walter into marriage while her oblivious friend looks on. Later, she abandons the family to become the unmarried mistress of William Elliot.

Admiral Croft– A good-natured, plainspoken tenant at Kellynch Hall and brother-in-law of Captain Wentworth. In his naval career, he was a captain when he married, present at the majorBattle of Trafalgarin 1805, then assigned to theEast Indies, and now holds the rank ofrear admiral of the white.

Sophia Croft– Sister of Captain Wentworth and wife of Admiral Croft for the last fifteen years. She is 38 years old. She offers Anne an example of a strong-minded woman who has married for love instead of money and who has a good life as a naval wife.

Louisa Musgrove– Second sister of Charles Musgrove, aged about 19. Louisa is a high-spirited young woman who has returned with her sister from school. She likes Captain Wentworth and seeks his attention. She is ultimately engaged to Captain Benwick after recovering from her serious fall inLyme Regis. Her brother Charles notices that she is less lively after suffering the concussion.

Henrietta Musgrove– Eldest sister of Charles Musgrove. Henrietta, aged about 20, is informally engaged to her cousin, Charles Hayter, but is tempted by the more dashing Captain Wentworth. Once Hayter returns home, she again connects with him.

Captain Harville– A friend of Captain Wentworth. Wounded two years previously, he is slightly lame. Wentworth has not seen his friend since the time of that injury, and is eager to reconnect. Harville and his family are settled in nearby Lyme for the winter. His wife tends to Louisa, and the children come to stay with the Musgroves for the Christmas holiday.

Captain James Benwick– A friend of Captains Harville and Wentworth. Benwick was engaged to marry Captain Harville's sister Fanny, but she died while Benwick was at sea. He gained prize money as a lieutenant and was promoted tocommander(thus earning the right to be called Captain). Benwick's enjoyment of reading gives him a connection with Anne as does her willingness to listen to him in his time of deep sadness. Benwick was with Louisa Musgrove during her recovery, at the end of which they become engaged to marry.

William Elliot– A distant relation (""great grandson of the second Sir Walter"" when it is not stated from which later holder of the baronetcy Sir Walter descends in order to be the current holder of the title) and theheir presumptiveof Sir Walter. It is later revealed that, beneath his charming veneer, Mr Elliot is a cold, calculating opportunist. He became estranged from the family when he married a woman of lower social rank for her fortune and actively insulted his uncle; his relatives cast him aside, until he returned as a wealthy man when they desperately needed money. Despite rumours that he is interested in Elizabeth, he instead turns his attentions towards Anne. He is a widower, eager to claim the social value of the title that he will someday inherit. He also has an interest in Mrs Clay, Elizabeth's companion, and she later becomes his mistress, although this turns out largely to be an attempt by William to stop his uncle from remarrying and potentially producing a son who would inherit Kellynch instead of William.

Mrs Smith– A friend of Anne Elliot who lives in Bath. Mrs Smith is a widow who suffers ill health and financial difficulties. She keeps abreast of the doings of Bath society through news she gets from her nurse, Rooke, who tends the wife of a friend of William Elliot's. Her financial problems could have been straightened out with assistance from William Elliot, her husband's friend and executor of his will, but Elliot's greed led him to hide most of her remaining fortune with the expectation that he would eventually be able to take it for himself. Wentworth eventually acts on her behalf when William departs Bath, allowing Mrs Smith to claim her money.

Lady Dalrymple– Aviscountess, cousin to Sir Walter. She occupies an exalted position in society by virtue of wealth and rank. Sir Walter and Elizabeth are eager to be seen at Bath in the company of this great relation and her daughter, Miss Carteret, at a time when their own social status is in question.

Miss Carteret– Daughter of Lady Dalrymple, who is always in tow behind the viscountess. Considered by Anne and others to be undeserving and very ordinary in intelligence and social graces. Elizabeth, who is more socially motivated, tolerates her company.

Readers ofPersuasionmight conclude that Austen intended ""persuasion"" to be the unifying theme of the story, as the idea of persuasion runs through the book, with vignettes within the story as variations on that theme. British literary scholarGillian Beerestablishes that Austen had profound concerns about the levels and applications of ""persuasion"" employed in society, especially as it related to the pressures and choices facing the young women of her day. Beer asserts that persuasion was indeed ""fraught with moral dangers"" for Austen and her contemporary readers;[2]: xvshe notes particularly that Austen personally was appalled by what she came to regard as her own misguided advice to her beloved niece Fanny Knight on the very question of whether Fanny ought to accept a particular suitor, even though it would have meant a protracted engagement. Beer writes:

Fanny ultimately rejected her suitor and married someone else after her aunt's death.[2]: x–xv

Thus, Beer explains, Austen was keenly aware that the human quality of persuasion—to persuade or to be persuaded, rightly or wrongly—is fundamental to the process of human communication, and that, in her novel ""Jane Austen gradually draws out the implications of discriminating 'just' and 'unjust' persuasion."" Indeed, the narrative winds through a number of situations in which people influence or attempt to influence other people, or themselves. Finally, Beer calls attention to ""the novel's entire brooding on the power pressures, the seductions, and also the new pathways opened by persuasion.""[2]: xv–xviii

Canadian scholar Sheila Johnson Kindred states that parts ofPersuasionwere inspired by the career of Austen's brotherCharles Austen, a Royal Navy officer, as there are some similarities between the career of the real-life Captain Austen and the fictional Captain Wentworth: both began their careers in command of sloops in the North America station at about the same age; both were popular with their crews; both progressed to the command of frigates; both were keen to share their prize money with their crews, though Captain Wentworth ended up considerably richer as a result of his prize money than did Captain Austen.[3]

Likewise, Captain Austen's wife Fanny, whom he married in Bermuda in 1807, bears some similarities to Mrs Croft, who, like Fanny Austen, lived aboard naval vessels for a time; lived alternatively inBermudaandHalifax(the two ports that hosted the Royal Navy's North America station); crossed the Atlantic five times, though Mrs Croft was middle-aged in the novel while Fanny Austen was 15 when she married Captain Austen.[4]

Jane Austen liked Fanny Austen, whom she admired for her ""unfussiness and gallant good sense.""[4]Even after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Fanny Austen was anxious to follow her husband back to the North America station despite the danger of American attacks on Bermuda and Halifax. Jane Austen was impressed with her devotion according to Kindred, seeing Fanny's desire to be with her husband no matter the danger as an attractive trait. Likewise, inPersuasion,Mrs Croft follows her husband everywhere despite the dangers.[5]

Author Andrew Norman has argued thatBarrington Courtwas the inspiration for 'Kellynch Hall.'[6]

In a letter to her niece Fanny Knight in March 1817, Austen wrote that she had a novel ""which may appear about a twelvemonth hence.""[7]John Murray publishedPersuasiontogether withNorthanger Abbeyin a four-volume set, printed in December 1817 but dated 1818. The first advertisement appeared on 17 December 1817. The Austen family retained copyright of the 1,750 copies, which sold rapidly.[7]The later editions of both were published separately.

The book's title is not Jane Austen's but her brother Henry's, who named it after her early death. There is no known source that documents what Austen intended to call her novel. Whatever her intentions might have been, Austen spoke of the novel asThe Elliots,according to family tradition, and some critics believe that is probably the title she planned for it.[8]

Henry Austen supplied a ""Biographical Notice"" of his sister in which her identity was revealed; she was no longer an anonymous author.

UnlikeSense and SensibilityandPride and Prejudice,Persuasionwas not rewritten from earlier drafts of novels that Austen had originally started before 1800.

American literary historianA Walton Litzhas emphasized the special quality ofPersuasionamong Austen's novels, as it was written over a relatively narrow space of two or three years from start to finish. Almost all of Austen's novels were written in the form of first drafts (now lost) from before 1800, over a decade before their first publication in the last years of Austen's life. SincePersuasionwas written over such a narrow time frame, Litz was able to locate and publish Austen's early handwritten drafts as she refined the text of the novel into its final published form.Persuasionis unique among Austen's novels in allowing such a close inspection, as recorded by Litz, of her editorial prowess in revising and enhancing early drafts of her own writing.[9]Litz, citing the research of Norman Page, gives an example of Austen's meticulous editing by excerpting a passage of Austen's cancelled Chapter Ten of the novel and comparing it to the revised version. In its original version, the manuscript stated:

Litz then gives the final version by Austen:

To this may be added the surviving version of Austen's handwritten copy of the original draft before the editing process outlined above had even started where Austen wrote it in the following nascent form:

In his essay ""Persuasion: forms of estrangement"", A Walton Litz summarises the issues critics have raised withPersuasionas a novel:[9]

In her 1980 book on Austen, Susan Morgan challenges Litz on callingPersuasiona novel showing Austen's assimilation of the new romantic poetry. Morgan notes Litz's comment on ""the deeply physical impact ofPersuasion""; he remarks that ""Mansfield Parkis about the loss and return of principles,Emmaabout the loss and return of reason,Persuasionabout the loss and return of 'bloom'."" According to Morgan, Litz ""acknowledges the crudeness of these formulations, and we recognize that he is attempting to discuss a quality of the novel that is hard to describe. But such summaries, even tentatively offered, only distort. The few brief nature scenes inPersuasion(and they are brief, out of all proportion to the commentary on them), the walk to Winthrop and the environs of Pinny and Lyme, are certainly described with sensibility and appreciation. And in Anne's mind they are just as certainly bound up with 'the sweets of poetical despondence'.""[10]

Persuasionis the first of Austen's novels to feature as the central character a woman who, by the standards of the time, is past the first bloom of youth. British literary critic Robert P Irvine writes thatPersuasion""is in many ways a radical departure"" from Austen's earlier novels.[11]Austen biographerClaire Tomalincharacterizes the book as Austen's ""present to herself, to Miss Sharp, toCassandra, toMartha Lloyd...to all women who had lost their chance in life and would never enjoy a second spring.""[12]

A recurring debate in 18th-century Britain concerned the power of books over women: were women more susceptible to the power of reading than men, and if so, was reading a benign or malign influence on them?[13]Austen first addressed this question inNorthanger Abbey, in which reading Gothic books has comic effects for Catherine Morland, and also gives her a more acute sense of reality and people.[13]The American scholar Adela Pinch writes that Austen returns to this theme inPersuasionbut in a more mature and probing manner, asPersuasionis concerned with ""what it feels like to be a reader. It does so by connecting this feeling to what the presence of other people feel like. It explores, that is, the influence reading can have on one's mind by comparing it to the influence of one person's mind over another's.""[13]

Pinch writes thatPersuasionhas been called the most lyrical of Austen's novels; ""Its emphasis on memory and subjectivity has been called Wordsworthian, its emotional tone has been likened to Shelley and Keats, and its epistemological strategies compared to Coleridge's conversation poems. Its modernity has been hinted through allusions to the lyric fiction of Virginia Woolf.""[14]

Pinch also writes that Austen is more concerned with spatial matters as various families, especially the Musgroves, are portrayed in terms of the amount of space they take up and noise they generate.[15]For example, Captain Wentworth and Elliot are prevented from embracing by grossly obese Mrs Musgrove, and Sir Walter comments after seeing some Royal Navy sailors that they are ""fit not to be seen""; Austen notes how people look and the brain registers visual information.[16]Pinch describesPersuasionas a novel of ""repetitions, of things happening within a strong context of memory.""[17]Anne is often lost in her own world of thought, and throughout the book the phrase ""Anne found herself"" recurs.[18]During her walk at Winthrop on a November day, Anne ruminates on various aspects of her life and the books she has read, and Austen seems to suggest that reading is insufficient consolation for a woman's pain, but also unavoidable if one wishes for her comfort.[19]

The literary scholarStuart Tave, in his essay on Anne Elliot, notes the melancholy qualities of her reality after she turns down Captain Wentworth's original proposal of marriage. For Tave, Austen portrays Anne as a character with many admirable traits, usually exceeding the characters who surround her in these traits. Tave singles out Austen's portrayal of Anne at the end of the novel in her conversation with Captain Harville, when they discuss the relative virtues of gender and their advantages compared to one another; Tave sees Anne as displaying remarkable intelligence. Tave quotes from Virginia Woolf'sA Room of One's Own: ""It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen's day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex."" Tave applies Woolf's insight toPersuasion, writing: ""All histories are against you, Captain Harville says to Anne in their disagreement about man's nature and woman's nature, 'all stories, prose and verse.' He could bring fifty quotations in a moment to his side of the argument, from books, songs, proverbs. But they were all written by men. 'Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story,' as Anne says.Persuasionis the story told by a woman.""[20]

In her book on Austen, the critic Julia Prewitt Brown finds significance in comparingPersuasiontoEmmawith regard to Austen's ability to vary her narrative technique. Brown writes:

Robert Irvine writes that, unlike other Austen heroes, who are either part of the gentry, the aristocracy or the Church of England, Wentworth is aself-made manwho has become rich via prize money allowed to those who served in the Royal Navy.[22]Sir Walter disparages naval officers like Wentworth and Croft because they ""spoil"" their complexions outside on the sea and have risen ""too quickly"" in social status. But Sir Walter is portrayed as financially incompetent, having squandered his inherited wealth, whereas Wentworth uses his prize money wisely.[23]Sir Walter's dismissal of the navy men who played such a prominent role in defeating Napoleon is considered unpatriotic and ungrateful.[23]According to the scholar Gary Kelly, Sir Walter is a stand-in for the notoriously spendthrift and snobbish Prince Regent George—of whom Austen deeply disapproved—who was infamous for his womanizing, gambling, drinking, and inability to pay his colossal debts.[23]At the time, there was a widespread belief that Britain defeated France despite the Prince Regent rather than because of him, and Kelly states that a character like Sir Walter—who did nothing to defeat Napoleon—attacking someone like Wentworth was Austen's way of expressing her frustration at the Prince Regent taking credit for defeating Napoleon.[23]

Anne and Wentworth, once married, do not become part of the land-owning gentry; Austen writes that the two were destined for ""settled life.""[22]According to Irvine, the sailors inPersuasionare the ""most subversive characters"" in all of Austen's books, as they possess ""national importance"" only by the virtue of their role in defeating Napoleon and do not own land or ask for social recognition from the gentry.[22]The Royal Navy inPersuasionis a meritocracy where one rises up via one's talents, not via birth and land, which makesPersuasionthe most radical of all of Austen's novels, according to Irvine.[22]

Irvine notes that the gentry characters inPersuasionare an ""unimpressive lot."" Sir Walter is portrayed as a vain, pompous, and incapable of providing love for his children, while the Musgroves lack class and elegance.[24]John Wiltshire writes that Sir Walter obsessively reads books relating only to the baronetage, and the Musgroves are relentlessly philistine in their tastes.[25]Admiral and Mrs Croft do not plan to buy an estate, being content to rent Kellynch Hall, and are described as taking better care of the estate than Sir Walter, whose family has owned Kellynch Hall for three generations.[26]Wiltshire considers that the Musgroves' and Sir Walter's narrowness of vision and taste highlight the heightened state of Anne's consciousnesses.[25]

Charles Musgrove, though friendly and respectable, is portrayed as unsuitable for Anne as his only interests are guns, hunting, dogs and horses.[27]Irvine notes that in British fiction at the time, it was a normal plot device for women—who were portrayed as more sensitive and poetical than men—to improve someone like Charles by showing him that there is more to life than hunting, but Anne rejects this role, and the narrator suggests that she was right to do so.[28]The marriage of Anne's parents is presented as such a match, with Anne's mother attempting to ""improve"" Sir Walter, and her life becoming thoroughly miserable as a result.[29]But the possibility of such a marriage seems to exist for Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove, as the narrator notes, ""he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron.""[29]According to Irvine, Benwick and Anne are similar characters, who have a profound sense of loss. Anne's heart still belongs to Wentworth, but Benwick is described as ""younger in feelings, if not in fact; younger as a man. He will rally again, and be happy with another"".[29]

Irvine writes of the differences between the Elliot sisters and Austen's other sibling relationships. In contrast to the Dashwood sisters (Sense and Sensibility) and the Bennet sisters (Pride and Prejudice), Anne is not close to her sisters.[30]

Lady Russell persuades Anne to reject Wentworth's first offer of marriage.[30]Lady Russell never expresses any guilt about breaking up Anne's relationship with Wentworth: ""her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt."" in reference to Lady Russell's reflection that Wentworth, who had once seemed to appreciate Anne's superior qualities, now appeared to be attracted to Louisa Musgrove, who, although pleasant, is vastly inferior to Anne in character.[25]

John Wiltshire notes that Wentworth is a man of action as opposed to words, which makes Anne the novel's only self-reflective character.[25]Anne becomes steadily more assertive, telling Mr Elliot at one point, ""My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.""[31]

Irvine writes that, unlike in Austen's other novels, a ""non-event"" at the beginning ofPersuasion—Anne does not marry Wentworth—shapes the rest of the plot, as the hero and heroine defeat the consequences of their shared history.[11]Irvine also says thatPersuasion'splot depends upon the main characters remaining the same, and the need for the characters to remain true to themselves, to cherish the memory of the ones they love, is emphasized by the signs of social decay around Anne; the gentry characters neglect their estates and treat the values they are supposed to uphold. Anne's love for Wentworth is the only fixed point in an otherwise fluid world.[32]

For Irvine,Persuasion's key moments come when a third party overhears somebody else's conversation, whereas conversation is a means for members of the elite to confirm their membership of a common group in Austen's other novels.[33]Louisa Musgrove discusses Admiral Croft's carriage driving with Wentworth, which leads her to say, ""If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would be always with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.""[33]According to Irvine, overhearing this conversation brings back Anne's memories of her love for Wentworth and brings her sorrow as she fears that he is falling in love with Louisa.[34]Another overheard conversation occurs during the novel's climax, when Anne debates with Captain Harville the respective capacity for faithfulness of men and women, which Wentworth overhears.[35]Not realising that Wentworth is listening, Anne says, ""All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one, you need not covet it) is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.""[36]The narrator notes that, after saying this, ""She [Anne] could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed.""[36]As Wentworth fears a second rejection by Anne, John Wiltshire, known for his work on psychoanalysis and literature,[37]feels that much of the novel is concerned with incidents that bring the two together and relies upon relating Anne's psychological state as she comes close to the man who once proposed marriage to her, making it more of a psychological study.[38]

In the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition,Persuasionis called a greatCinderella story. It features a heroine who is generally unappreciated and to some degree exploited by those around her; a handsome prince who appears on the scene but seems more interested in the ""more obvious"" charms of others; a moment of realisation; and a happy ending. It has been said that it is not that Anne is unloved, but rather that those around her no longer see her clearly: she is such a fixed part of their lives that her likes and dislikes, wishes and dreams, are no longer considered, even by those who claim to value her, like Lady Russell.[citation needed]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27761,"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet,"Prince Hamletof Denmark is the son of the recently deceasedKing Hamlet, and nephew ofKing Claudius, his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouringNorway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, PrinceFortinbras, is imminent.

On a cold night on the ramparts ofElsinore, the Danish royal castle, thesentriesBernardo and Marcellus discuss aghostresembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friendHoratioas a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.

The court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviserPolonius. Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and he sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university inWittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.

As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim ""to thine own self be true.""[6]Polonius's daughter,Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, tells the prince that he was  murdered by Claudius (by pouring poison into his ear as he slept), and demands that Hamlet avenge the murder. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to ""put an antic disposition on"", or act as though he has gone mad. Hamlet forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.

Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen are welcomingRosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the two students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the king of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent againstPoland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.

Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and then speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to learn more. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his ""friends"" warmly but quickly discerns that they are there to spy on him for Claudius. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead remarking ""What a piece of work is a man"". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death ofKing Priam, as witnessed byQueen Hecuba, at the climax of theTrojan War. Hamlet then asks the actors to stageThe Murder of Gonzago, a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder. Hamlet intends to study Claudius's reaction to the play, and thereby determine the truth of the ghost's story of Claudius's guilt.

Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters to the prince while he and Claudius secretly watch in order to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance. Hamlet muses on thoughts oflife versus death. When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries ""get thee to a nunnery"", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing thePlayer Kingmurdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof of his uncle's guilt.

Gertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind atapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.

Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.

Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.

Unhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.

Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Twogravediggersdiscuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of ajesterfrom Hamlet's childhood,Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying ""Alas, poor Yorick"" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia'sfuneral processionapproaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter among Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier,Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet from Laertes. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming ""the rest is silence"". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20228,Noli Me Tangere (Tagalog),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noli_Me_T%C3%A1ngere_(novel),"Crisóstomo Ibarra, themestizoson of the recently deceased Don Rafael Ibarra, is returning to the town of San Diego inLagunaafter seven years of study inEurope. Kapitán Tiago, a family friend, invites him to a reunion party inManila. At the party, Crisóstomo meets Padre Dámaso who was San Diego's parish priest when Crisóstomo left for Europe. Dámaso treats Crisóstomo with hostility, to the surprise of the young man who regarded the priest as his father's friend. Later, as Crisóstomo was walking back to his hotel, Lieutenant Guevara, another friend of his father, informs him that Don Rafael may have been killed for political reasons and Dámaso may have been involved. Guevara warns him to be careful.

The following day, Crisóstomo returns to Tiago's home to meet with his childhood sweetheart, Tiago's daughter María Clara. As the two flirt and reminisce, María reads back to him a part of his farewell letter on his discussion with his father about the state of the country. Ibarra excuses himself eventually as it was time to go to San Diego.

Arriving in San Diego, Crisóstomo goes to the cemetery and finds his father's grave desecrated. He seeks out the gravedigger who then tells him that the parish priest had ordered Don Rafael's remains transferred to the Chinese cemetery, but that he threw the corpse into the lake instead out of fear and pity. At that moment, the town's new parish priest, Padre Bernardo Salví, passes by wherein an enraged Crisóstomo pushes him to the ground, demanding an explanation; a fearful Salví states that he was only newly assigned to the town but reveals that Padre Dámaso ordered the transfer.

Crisóstomo decides to forgive and commits to improvements in his town. He plans to build a private school, believing that hispaisanoswould benefit from a more modern education than what is offered in thegovernment schools, which were under the influence of the friars. Enjoying widespread support from the locals andSpanish authorities, Crisóstomo's project advances quickly. He receives counsel from Don Anastacio, a local philosopher, and recruits a progressive schoolmaster. Construction was set to begin shortly with thecornerstoneto be laid in a few weeks during San Diego's town fiesta.

One day, Crisóstomo, María and their friends go on a picnic along the shores of theLaguna de Baý. They discover that a crocodile had been lurking in the Ibarras' fish pens. The boatman jumps into the water with aknifedrawn. Crisóstomo follows him and the two subdue the animal together. Elías, the boatman, proclaims himself indebted to Crisóstomo.

On the day of the fiesta, Elías warns Crisóstomo of a plot to kill him at the cornerstone ceremony. Sure enough, Crisóstomo evades injury and the would-be assassin is killed. During the luncheon, an uninvited Padre Dámaso further berates Crisóstomo. The other guests hiss for discretion, but Dámaso carries on and insults the memory of Don Rafael. Crisóstomo then loses control, strikes the friar unconscious and holds a knife to his neck. Crisóstomo tells the guests about Dámaso's schemes that resulted in his father's death, but releases Dámaso when María Clara pleads for mercy. Crisóstomo isexcommunicatedfrom the Church, but has it lifted in Manila through the intercession of the sympathetic captain-general. Returning to San Diego, he finds María ill and refusing to see him.

Meanwhile, Elías senses Crisóstomo's influence with the government and takes him for a sail so they can talk in private. Elías reveals that arevolutionary grouphad been trying to recruit him but he stalled in order to get Crisóstomo's views first. The conversation shifts to Elías' family history. It turns out that Elías' grandfather, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office, but one night a fire consumes the office and the Spanish proprietor accuses him of arson. He was prosecuted and jailed; upon release, he was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife turned to prostitution to support the family. Their lives were ruined.

Crisóstomo says that he cannot help and his school project is his focus. Rebuffed, Elías advises Crisóstomo to avoid him in the future, for his own safety. However, Elías returns a few days later to tell him of a rogue uprising planned for that same night. The instigators hadused Crisóstomo's name in vainto recruit malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared tospring a trapon the rebels. Realizing the scheme's repercussions, Crisóstomo abandons his school project and enlists Elías in sorting out and destroying documents that may implicate him. Elías obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don Pedro Eibarramendia. Crisóstomo says Pedro was his great-grandfather and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elías responds that Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather of arson, and thus condemned Elías and his family to misfortune. Elias leaves the house in consternation.

The uprising takes place and many of the rebels are captured or killed. They point to Crisóstomo as instructed and he is arrested. The following morning, the instigators are found dead—Padre Salví, the mastermind of the uprising, ordered his senior sexton to kill them in order to silence them. Meanwhile, Elias sneaks back into the Ibarra mansion and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns down the house. Crisóstomo and his co-accused are loaded into horse carts and taken to prison with their townmates shouting in anger and casting stones as they passed.

Kapitán Tiago later on hosts a dinner at his riverside house in Manila to celebrate María Clara's engagement with Alfonso Linares, a Peninsular who was presented as her new suitor following Crisóstomo's excommunication. Present at the party were Padre Salví, Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other acquaintances. They spoke of the events in San Diego and Crisóstomo's fate. Salví, who lusted after María Clara all along and staged the uprising in order to frame Crisóstomo, says he requested to be moved to the Convent of the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of the San Diego uprising being too much for him.

Guevara outlines how the court came to condemn Crisóstomo. In a signed letter he wrote before leaving for Europe, Crisóstomo spoke of his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Crisóstomo's handwriting was copied to create recruitment letters for the uprising. The signature on the letters was similar to Crisóstomo's seven years before, but not at present day. Crisóstomo only had to deny ownership of the signature on the original letter and the case built on the bogus letters would be dismissed. But upon seeing the letter, which was of course his farewell letter to María Clara, Crisóstomo lost the will to fight the charges, and he is sentenced to bedeported. Guevara then approaches María who had been listening. Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense in yielding the letter. Now, she can live a life of peace. María is devastated.

Later that evening Crisóstomo, having escaped prison with the help of Elías, confronts María in secret. María admits giving up his letter because Salví found Dámaso's old letters in the San Diego parsonage, letters from María's mother who was then pregnant with her and begging Dámaso for an abortion. It turns out that Dámaso was María's biological father. Salvípromisednot to divulge Dámaso's letters in exchange for Crisóstomo's farewell letter. Crisóstomo forgives her, María swears her undying love, and they part with a kiss.

Crisóstomo and Elías slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo and into thePasig River. Elías tells Crisóstomo that his family treasure is buried at the Ibarra forest in San Diego. Wishing to make restitution, Crisóstomo tells Elías to flee with him to a foreign country where they will live as brothers. Elías declines, stating that his fate lies with the country he wishes to reform. Crisóstomo then tells him of his own desire for revolution to lengths that even Elías was unwilling to go. Just then, sentries catch up with their boat at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue them across Laguna de Bay. Elías orders Crisóstomo to lie down and to meet him at his family's mausoleum in the forest. Elías then jumps into the water to distract the pursuers and is shot several times.

The following day, María reads in the newspapers that Crisóstomo had been killed by sentries in pursuit. She remorsefully demands of Dámaso that her wedding with Linares be cancelled and that she be entered into the cloister, or the grave. Seeing her resolution, Dámaso admits he ruined Crisóstomo because he was a meremestizoand Dámaso wanted María to be happy and secure, and that was possible only if she married apeninsular Spaniard. Knowing why Salví had earlier requested to be assigned to the Convent of the Poor Clares, Dámaso pleads with María to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping, Dámaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.

A few nights later in the Ibarra forest, a boy pursues his mother through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant beating of her husband, the death of her younger son in the hands of Padre Salví, and the loss of her elder son to theGuardia Civil. Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the Ibarra mausoleum, but the strain had already been too great for Sisa. She dies in Basilio's embrace. As Basilio grieves for his mother, Elías stumbles into the mausoleum, himself dying from his wounds. He instructs Basilio to cremate their bodies and if no one comes, to dig inside the mausoleum, where he will find treasures, which he is to use for his own education.

As Basilio leaves to fetch the wood, Elías sinks to the ground and whispers that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget those who died in the darkness. Upon returning, Basilio encounters Ibarra also mourning for Elias. The two build a pyre for them before burying their remains. Following the funeral, Ibarra and Basilio dig the mausoleum for the treasures, which the latter receives a share of. Before letting Basilio leave, Ibarra re-echoes Elias' dying advice on the use of the treasures to the boy.

Afterwards, it is revealed that Dámaso is transferred to a remote town; distraught, he is found dead a day later. Tiago fell into depression, became addicted to opium and faded to obscurity. Salví, while waiting for his consecration as abishop, serves as chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares. Meanwhile, during a stormy evening in September, two patrolmen reported seeing aspecteron the roof of the convent weeping in despair. The next day, a government representative visited the convent to try to investigate the previous night's events. One of the nuns had a wet and torn gown and with tears told the representative of ""tales of horror"" and begged for ""protection against the outrages of hypocrisy"" (strongly suggesting that Padre Salví regularly rapes her when he is in the convent). Theabbess, however, said that she was mad. A general also attempted to investigate the nun's case but by then, the abbess prohibited visits to the convent. Nothing more was said about this nun, or for that matter, María Clara.

Rizal finished the novel in March 1887. At first, according to one of Rizal's biographers, Rizal feared the novel might not be printed, and that it would remain unread.[citation needed]He was struggling with financial constraints at the time and thought it would be hard to pursue printing the novel.

His friendMáximo Violaprovided some financial aid, enabling Rizal to have the book printed at Berliner Buchdruckerei-Aktiengesellschaft inBerlin. Viola loaned Rizal₱300 for 2,000 copies. The printing was finished earlier than the estimated five months. Viola arrived inBerlinin December 1886, and by March 21, 1887, Rizal had sent a copy of the novel to his friend,Ferdinand Blumentritt.[6]

Spanish authorities in the Philippines banned the book, but copies were smuggled into the country. The first Philippine edition (and the second published edition) was printed in 1899 in Manila by Chofre y Compania in Escolta.

On August 21, 2007, a 480-page English-language version ofNoli Me Tángerewas released to major Australian book stores.Penguin Classics(animprintbyPenguin Books) published this edition in keeping with its ""commitment to publish the major literary classics of the world.""[7]

American writerHarold Augenbraum, who first readNoliin 1992, had translated the novel. A writer well-acquainted with translating otherSpanish-languageliterary works, Augenbraum proposed to translate the novel. Penguin changed their initial plan of adapting existing English versions and instead commissioned him to make a new translation.[7]

This novel and its sequel,El filibusterismo(nicknamedEl fili), were banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines because of their allegations of corruption and abuse by the colonial government and the Catholic Church. Copies of the book were nevertheless smuggled in and hidden, and when Rizal returned to the Philippines after completing medical studies, he quickly ran afoul of the local government. A few days after his arrival, Rizal was summoned toMalacañan Palaceby Governor-GeneralEmilio Terrero, who told him of the charge thatNoli Me Tángerecontained subversive elements. After a discussion, Terrero was appeased but still unable to offer resistance to pressure from the Church against the book. The persecution can be discerned from Rizal's letter toFerdinand Blumentritt:

Rizal was exiled toDapitaninMindanao, then later arrested for ""inciting rebellion"" based largely on his writings. Rizal was executed byfiring squadat Bagumbayan outside Manila's walls on December 30, 1896, at the age of thirty-five, at thepark that now bears his name.

Rizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a man's life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.

The work was instrumental in creating a unifiedFilipino national identityand consciousness, as many natives previously identified with their respective regions. Itlampooned, caricatured and exposed various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular have become classics in Filipino culture: María Clara, who has become apersonificationof the ideal Filipino woman, loving and unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father Dámaso, who reflects thecovert fathering of illegitimate children by members of the Spanish clergy.[8]

The book indirectly influenced thePhilippine Revolutionof independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain's political affairs. In 1956,CongresspassedRepublic Act 1425, more popularly known as theRizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum.Noli Me Tángereis being taught to third-year secondary school (now Grade 9, due to the new K-12 curriculum) students, while its sequelEl Filibusterismois being taught for fourth-year secondary school (now Grade 10) students. The novels are incorporated to their study and survey ofPhilippine literature.[9]Both of Rizal's novels were initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.[10]

DonJuan Crisóstomo Eibarramendia y Magsalin, commonly referred to in the novel as Ibarra or Crisóstomo, is the novel's protagonist. Themestizo(mixed-race) son of Filipino businessmanDonRafael Ibarra, he studied in Europe for seven years.[11][12]Ibarra is also María Clara's fiancé.

María Clara de los Santos y Alba, commonly referred to as María Clara, María, or Clarita, is Ibarra's fiancée and the most beautiful and widely celebrated girl in San Diego.[13]She was raised by Kapitán Tiago de los Santos, and his cousin, Isabel. In the later parts of the novel, she was revealed to be an illegitimate daughter of Father Dámaso, the formercurateof the town, and Doña Pía Alba, Kapitán Tiago's wife, who haddied giving birthto María Clara.[14]

At the novel's end, a heartbroken yet resolved María Clara entered the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara (aPoor Clarenunnery) after learning the truth of her parentage and mistakenly believing that her lover, Crisóstomo, had been killed. In the epilogue, Rizal stated that it is unknown whether María Clara is still living within the walls of the convent or is already dead.[15]

DonSantiago de los Santos, known by his nickname Tiyago and political title Kapitán Tiyago, is said to be the richest man in the region ofBinondoand possessed real properties inPampangaandLaguna de Baý. He is also said to be a good Catholic, a friend of the Spanish government and thus was considered a Spaniard by the colonial elite. Kapitán Tiyago never attended school, so he became thedomestic helperof aDominicanfriarwho gave him an informal education. He later married Pía Alba fromSanta Cruz.[13]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3825,Pygmalion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play),"A group of people are sheltering from the rain. Among them are the Eynsford-Hills, superficial social climbers eking out a living in ""genteel poverty"". First seen are Mrs Eynsford-Hill and her daughter Clara; Clara's brother Freddy enters having earlier been dispatched to secure them a cab (which they can ill afford), but being rather timid and faint-hearted he has failed to do so. As he goes off once again to find a cab, he bumps into aflower girl, Eliza Doolittle. Her flowers drop into the mud ofCovent Garden, the flowers she needs to survive in her poverty-stricken world.

They are soon joined by a gentleman, Colonel Pickering. While Eliza tries to sell flowers to the Colonel, a bystander informs her that another man is writing down everything she says. That man is Henry Higgins, alinguistand phonetician. Eliza worries that Higgins is a police officer and will not calm down until Higgins introduces himself.

It soon becomes apparent that he and Colonel Pickering have a shared interest inphoneticsand an intense mutual admiration; indeed, Pickering has come fromIndiaspecifically to meet Higgins, and Higgins was planning to go to India to meet Pickering. Higgins tells Pickering that he could pass off the flower girl as a duchess merely by teaching her to speak properly.

These words of bravado spark an interest in Eliza, who would love to make changes in her life and become more mannerly, even though to her it only means working in a flower shop. At the end of the act, Freddy returns after finding a taxi, only to find that his mother and sister have gone and left him with the cab. The streetwise Eliza takes the cab from him, using the money that Higgins tossed to her, leaving him on his own soul 
.

Higgins's house– the next day

As Higgins demonstrates his phonetics to Pickering, the housekeeper Mrs Pearce tells him that a young girl wants to see him. Eliza has shown up because she wants to talk like a lady in a flower shop. She tells Higgins that she will pay for lessons. He shows no interest, but she reminds him of his boast the previous day: he had claimed that he could pass her off as a duchess.

Pickering makes a bet with him on his claim and says that he will pay for her lessons if Higgins succeeds. She is sent off to have a bath. Mrs Pearce tells Higgins that he must behave himself in the young girl's presence, meaning he must stop swearing and improve his table manners, but he is at a loss to understand why she should find fault with him.

Alfred Doolittle, Eliza's father, appears, with the sole purpose of getting money out of Higgins, having no paternal interest in his daughter's welfare. He requests and receives five pounds in compensation for the loss of Eliza, although Higgins, much amused by Doolittle's approach to morality, is tempted to pay ten.

Doolittle refuses; he sees himself as a member of the undeserving poor and means to go on being undeserving. With his intelligent mind untamed by education, he has an eccentric view of life. He is also aggressive, and Eliza, on her return, sticks her tongue out at him. He goes to hit her, but Pickering prevents him. The scene ends with Higgins telling Pickering that they really have a difficult job on their hands.

Mrs Higgins's drawing room

Higgins bursts in and tells his mother he has picked up a ""common flower girl"" whom he has been teaching. Mrs Higgins is unimpressed with her son's attempts to win her approval, because it is her 'at home' day and she is entertaining visitors. The visitors are the Eynsford-Hills. When they arrive, Higgins is rude to them.

Eliza enters and soon falls into talking about the weather and her family. While she is now able to speak in beautifully modulated tones, the substance of what she says remains unchanged from the gutter. She confides her suspicions that her aunt was killed by relatives, mentions that gin had been ""mother's milk"" to her aunt, and that Eliza's own father was ""always more agreeable when he had a drop in"".

Higgins passes off her remarks as ""the new small talk"", and Freddy is enraptured by Eliza. When she is leaving, he asks her if she is going to walk across the park, to which she replies, ""Walk? Not bloody likely!"" (This is the most famous line from the play and, for many years after the play's debut, use of the word 'bloody' was known as apygmalion; Mrs Campbell was considered to have risked her career by speaking the line on stage.)[9]

After Eliza and the Eynsford-Hills leave, Higgins asks for his mother's opinion. She says the girl is not presentable and she is concerned about what will happen to her, but neither Higgins nor Pickering understands her concerns about Eliza's future. They leave feeling confident and excited about how Eliza will get on. This leaves Mrs Higgins feeling exasperated, and exclaiming, ""Men! Men!! Men!!!""

Higgins's house – midnight

Higgins, Pickering, and Eliza have returned from a ball. A tired Eliza sits unnoticed, brooding and silent, while Pickering congratulates Higgins on winning the bet. Higgins scoffs and declares the evening a ""silly tomfoolery"", thanking God it's over, and saying that he had been sick of the whole thing for the last two months. Still barely acknowledging Eliza, beyond asking her to leave a note for Mrs Pearce regarding coffee, the two retire to bed.

Higgins soon returns to the room, looking for his slippers, and Eliza throws them at him. Higgins is taken aback, and is at first completely unable to understand Eliza's preoccupation, which, aside from being ignored after her triumph, is the question of what she is to do now. When Higgins finally understands, he makes light of it, saying she could get married, but Eliza interprets this as selling herself like a prostitute. ""We were above that at the corner ofTottenham Court Road.""

Finally she returns her jewellery to Higgins, including the ring he had given her, which he throws into the fireplace with a violence that scares Eliza. Furious with himself for losing his temper, he damns Mrs Pearce, the coffee, Eliza, and finally himself, for ""lavishing"" his knowledge and his ""regard and intimacy"" on a ""heartless guttersnipe"", and retires in great dudgeon. Eliza roots around in the fireplace and retrieves the ring.

Mrs Higgins's drawing room

The next morning Higgins and Pickering, perturbed by discovering that Eliza has walked out on them, call on Mrs Higgins to phone the police. Higgins is particularly distracted, since Eliza had assumed the responsibility of maintaining his diary and keeping track of his possessions, which causes Mrs Higgins to decry their calling the police as though Eliza were ""a lost umbrella"".

Doolittle is announced; he emerges dressed in splendid wedding attire and is furious with Higgins, who after their previous encounter had been so taken with Doolittle's unorthodox ethics that he had recommended him as the ""most original moralist in England"" to a rich American, a founder of Moral Reform Societies; the American had subsequently left Doolittle a pension worth three thousand pounds a year, as a consequence of which Doolittle feels intimidated into joining the middle class and marrying his missus.

Mrs Higgins observes that this at least settles the problem of who shall provide for Eliza, to which Higgins objects – after all, he paid Doolittle five pounds for her. Mrs Higgins informs her son that Eliza is upstairs, and explains the circumstances of her arrival, alluding to how marginalized and overlooked Eliza had felt the previous night. Higgins is unable to appreciate this, and sulks when told that he must behave if Eliza is to join them. Doolittle is asked to wait outside.

Eliza enters, at ease and self-possessed. Higgins blusters but Eliza is unshaken and speaks exclusively to Pickering. Throwing Higgins's previous insults back at him (""Oh, I'm only a squashed cabbage leaf""), Eliza remarks that it was only by Pickering's example that she learned to be a lady, which renders Higgins speechless.

Eliza goes on to say that she has completely left behind the flower girl she was, and that she couldn't utter any of her old sounds if she tried – at which point Doolittle emerges from the balcony, causing Eliza to emit her old sounds. Higgins is jubilant, jumping up and crowing over what he calls his victory. Doolittle explains his situation and asks if Eliza will come with him to his wedding. Pickering and Mrs Higgins also agree to go, and they leave, with Doolittle and Eliza to follow.

The scene ends with another confrontation between Higgins and Eliza. Higgins asks if Eliza is satisfied with the revenge she has brought thus far and if she will now come back, but she refuses. Higgins defends himself from Eliza's earlier accusation by arguing that he treats everyone the same, so she shouldn't feel singled out. Eliza replies that she just wants a little kindness, and that since he will never stoop to show her this, she will not come back, but will marry Freddy.

Higgins scolds her for such low ambitions: he has made her ""a consort for a king."" When she threatens to teach phonetics and offer herself as an assistant to Higgins's academic rival Nepommuck, Higgins again loses his temper and vows to wring her neck if she does so. Eliza realises that this last threat strikes Higgins at the very core and that it gives her power over him.

Higgins, for his part, is delighted to see a spark of fight in Eliza, rather than her erstwhile fretting and worrying. He remarks ""I like you like this"", and calls her a ""pillar of strength"". Mrs Higgins returns and she and Eliza depart for the wedding. As they leave, Higgins incorrigibly gives Eliza a list of errands to run, as though their recent conversation had not taken place. Eliza disdainfully tells him to do the errands himself. Mrs Higgins says that she'll get the items, but Higgins cheerfully tells her that Eliza will do it after all. Higgins laughs to himself at the idea of Eliza marrying Freddy as the play ends.

The play was well received by critics in major cities following its premières in Vienna, London, and New York.  The initial release in Vienna garnered several reviews describing the show as a positive departure from Shaw's usual dry and didactic style.[10]The Broadway première in New York was praised in terms of both plot and acting, and the play was described as ""a love story with brusque diffidence and a wealth of humour.""[11]Reviews of the production in London were slightly less positive.The Telegraphnoted that the play was deeply diverting, with interesting mechanical staging, although the critic ultimately found the production somewhat shallow and overly lengthy.[12]The Times, however, praised both the characters and the actors (especiallySir Herbert Beerbohm Treeas Higgins andMrs Patrick Campbellas Eliza) and the ""unconventional"" ending.[13][14]

Pygmalionwas the most broadly appealing of all Shaw's plays. But popular audiences, looking for pleasant entertainment with big stars in aWest Endvenue, wanted a ""happy ending"" for the characters they liked so well, as did some critics.[15]During the 1914 run, Tree sought to sweeten Shaw's ending to please himself and his record houses.[16]Shaw remained sufficiently irritated to add a postscript essay to the 1916 print edition, ""'What Happened Afterwards"",[17]for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married.

He continued to protect what he saw as the play's, and Eliza's, integrity by protecting the last scene. For at least some performances during the 1920 revival, Shaw adjusted the ending in a way that underscored the Shavian message. In an undated note to Mrs Campbell he wrote,

(This ending, however, is not included in any print version of the play.)

Shaw fought against a Higgins–Eliza happy-end pairing as late as 1938. He sent the1938 film version's producer,Gabriel Pascal, a concluding sequence that he felt offered a fair compromise: a tender farewell scene between Higgins and Eliza, followed by one showing Freddy and Eliza happy in their greengrocery-cum-flower shop. Only at the sneak preview did he learn that Pascal had finessed the question of Eliza's future with a slightly ambiguous final scene in which Eliza returns to the house of a sadly musing Higgins and self-mockingly quotes her previous self announcing, ""I washed my face and hands before I come, I did"".

There are two main versions of the play in circulation. One is based on the earlier version, first published in 1914; the other is a later version that includes several sequences revised by Shaw, first published in 1941. Therefore, different editions of the play omit or add certain lines. For instance, theProject Gutenbergversion published online, which is transcribed from an early version, does not include Eliza's exchange with Mrs Pearce in Act II, the scene with Nepommuck in Act III, or Higgins' famous declaration to Eliza, ""Yes, you squashed cabbage-leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language! I could pass you off as theQueen of Sheba!"" – a line so famous that it is now retained in nearly all productions of the play, including the 1938 film version ofPygmalionas well as in the stage and film versions ofMy Fair Lady.[19]

The co-director of the 1938 film,Anthony Asquith, had seen Mrs Campbell in the 1920 revival ofPygmalionand noticed that she spoke the line, ""It's my beliefas howthey done the old woman in."" He knew ""as how"" was not in Shaw's text, but he felt it added color and rhythm to Eliza's speech, and liked to think that Mrs Campbell hadad libbedit herself. Eighteen years later he added it toWendy Hiller's line in the film.[8]

In the original play Eliza's test is met at an ambassador's garden party, offstage. For the 1938 film Shaw and co-writers replaced that exposition with a scene at an embassy ball; Nepommuck, the blackmailing translator spoken about in the play, is finally seen, but his name is updated to Aristid Karpathy – named so by Gabriel Pascal, the film's Hungarian producer, who also made sure that Karpathy mistakes Eliza for a Hungarian princess. InMy Fair Ladyhe became Zoltan Karpathy. (The change of name was likely to avoid offending the sensibilities of Roman Catholics, asSt. John Nepomukwas, ironically, a Catholic martyr who refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional.)

The 1938 film also introduced the famous pronunciation exercises ""the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain"" and ""In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen"".[20]Neither of these appears in the original play. Shaw's screen version of the play as well as a new print version incorporating the new sequences he had added for the film script were published in 1941. Many of the scenes that were written for the films were separated by asterisks, and explained in a ""Note for Technicians"" section.

Pygmalionremains Shaw's most popular play. The play's widest audiences know it as the inspiration for the highly romanticized 1956musicaland 1964 filmMy Fair Lady.

Pygmalionhas transcended cultural and language barriers since its first production. TheBritish Librarycontains ""images of the Polish production...; a series of shots of a wonderfully Gallicised Higgins and Eliza in the first French production in Paris in 1923; a fascinating set for a Russian production of the 1930s. There was no country which didn't have its own 'take' on the subjects ofclass divisionand social mobility, and it's as enjoyable to view these subtle differences in settings and costumes as it is to imagine translators wracking their brains for their own equivalent of 'Not bloody likely'.""[21]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12,Through the Looking-Glass,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,"Aliceis playing with a white kitten (whom she calls ""Snowdrop"") and a black kitten (whom she calls ""Kitty"") while pondering what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up onto amantelpiece, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind a fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she can step through it. She finds herself in a reflected version of her own house and notices a book with looking-glass poetry, ""Jabberwocky"", whosereversed printingshe can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that thechess pieceshave come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.

Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak. Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets theRed Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability torun at breathtaking speeds.

The Red Queen reveals that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of theWhite Queen'spawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She arrives in a forest where a gnat teaches her about the looking glass insects, creatures part bug part object (e.g., bread and butterfly, rocking horse fly), before flying away. Continuing her journey, Alice crosses the ""wood where things have no names"". There she forgets all nouns, including her own name. With the help of a fawn who has also forgotten his identity, she makes it to the other side, where they both remember everything. Realizing that he is a fawn, she is a human, and that fawns are afraid of humans, it runs off.

She then meets the twin brothersTweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from thenursery rhyme. After recitinga poem, they draw Alice's attention to theRed King—sleeping under a nearby tree—and provoke her with idle philosophical banter that sheis but an imaginary figurein his dreams. The brothers begin suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts.

Alice next meets theWhite Queen, who is absent-minded but canremember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into atalking Sheepin asmall shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with shouting about ""crabs"" and ""feathers"".

After crossing another brook into the sixth rank, Alice encountersHumpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating hisunbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in ""Jabberwocky"". In the process, he introduces Alice to the concept ofportmanteauwords, before his inevitable fall.

All the king's horses and all the king's men come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, and are accompanied by theWhite King, along withthe Lion and the Unicorn, who proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other. TheMarch HareandHatter[a]appear in the guise of ""Anglo-Saxonmessengers"" called ""Haigha"" and ""Hatta"".

Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who wants to capture the ""white pawn""—Alice—until theWhite Knightcomes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recitesa poem of his own compositionand repeatedly falls off his horse.

Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with the crown materialising abruptly on her head.[b]She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens, who confound Alice by usingword playto thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by Alice—of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge.

Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party, which quickly turns into chaos. Alice grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day's nonsense, and begins shaking her.

Alice awakes in her armchair to find herself holding Kitty, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with Snowdrop having been the White Queen. Alice then recalls the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have been a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might be a figment of his imagination."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/521,The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe,"Robinson Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name ""Kreutznaer"") sets sail fromKingston upon Hull,England, on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his desire for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over bySalépirates(theSalé Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by aMoor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship isen routetoBrazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures aplantationin Brazil.

Years later, Crusoe joins an expedition topurchase slaves from Africabut the ship gets blown off course in a storm about forty miles out to sea and runs aground on the sandbar of an island off theVenezuelancoast (which he calls theIsland of Despair) near the mouth of theOrinoco Riveron 30 September 1659.[1]: Chapter 23The crew lowers the jolly boat, but it gets swamped by a tidal wave, drowning the crew, but leaving Crusoe the sole human survivor.  He observes the latitude as 9 degrees and 22 minutes north. He sees penguins andsealson this island. Aside from Crusoe, the captain's dog and two cats survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools and other supplies from the ship before the next storm breaks it apart. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar post to keep track of his time on the island. Over the years, by using tools salvaged from the ship, and some which he makes himself, he hunts animals, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery and traps and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads theBibleand becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society.  He also builds two boats: a large dugout canoe that he intends to use to sail to the mainland, but ends up being too large and too far from water to launch, and a smaller boat that he uses to explore the coast of the island.

More years pass and Crusoe discoverscannibals, who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat prisoners. Alarmed at this, he conserves the ammunition he'd used for hunting (running low at that point) for defence and fortifies his home in case the cannibals discover his presence on the island.  He plans to kill them for committing an abomination, but later realizes he has no right to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. One day, Crusoe finds that a SpanishGalleonhas run aground on the island during a storm, but his hopes for rescue are dashed when he discovers that the crew abandoned ship.  Nevertheless, the abandoned galleon's untouched supplies of food and ammunition, along with the ship's dog, add to Crusoe's reserves.  Every night, he dreams of obtaining one or two servants by freeing some prisoners; during the cannibals' next visit to the island, when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new companion ""Friday"" after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe teaches Friday the English language andconvertshim to Christianity.

Crusoe soon learns from Friday that the crew from the shipwrecked galleon he'd found had escaped to the mainland and are now living with Friday's tribe.  Seeing renewed hope for rescue and with Friday's help, Crusoe builds another, but smaller, dugout canoe for a renewed plan to sail to the mainland. After more cannibals arrive to partake in a feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of them and save two prisoners. One is Friday's father and the other is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about the other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday's father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port.

Before the Spaniards return, an English ship appears; the sailors have staged a mutiny against their captain and intend to leave him and those still loyal to him on the island. Crusoe and the ship's captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship. With their ringleader executed by the captain, the mutineers take up Crusoe's offer to remain on the island rather than being returned to England as prisoners to be hanged. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers how he survived on the island and states that the Spaniards will be coming.

Crusoe leaves the island on 19 December 1686 and arrives in England on 11 June 1687. He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father's will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England from Portugal to avoid travelling by sea. Friday accompanies him and,en route, they endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing thePyrenees.[10]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35,The Time Machine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine,"AVictorianEnglishman, identified only as theTime Traveller, tells his weekly dinner guests that he has experimental verification of a machine that can travel through time. He shows them what he says is a small model, and they watch it disappear. He says he has a big machine nearly finished in his laboratory, in which a person could travel through time. At dinner the following week, a weary, bedraggled Traveller recounts to his guests what he experienced on his journey to the future.

In thenew narrative, the Time Traveller goes into the future, observing things moving in quick motion around him. He sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Traveller stops inA.D.802,701, and meets the Eloi, a society of small, childlike humanoids. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet deteriorating buildings, and adhere to afruit-based diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline. They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, particularly moonless nights. They give no response to nocturnal disappearances, possibly because they are so afraid of them. After exploring the area around the Eloi's residences, the Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking what was once London and finds the ruins of what once was ametropolis. He concludes that the entire planet became a garden, with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior, and thatcommunism[21]has at last been achieved. He also theorizes that intelligence springs from necessity; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

Returning to the site where he arrived, the Traveller finds his machine missing; he is confident that it at least has not traveled through time, as he had removed its levers. Later, he encounters the Morlocks,ape-liketroglodyteswho live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Deducing that they must have taken his time machine, he explores one of many ""wells"" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings and discovers them operating the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He realizes that the Morlocks control and feed upon the Eloi. The Traveller speculates that the human race has diverged into two species: the favored aristocracy has become the Eloi, and their mechanical servants have become the Morlocks.

Meanwhile, he rescues EloiWeenafrom drowning, as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight. The Traveller takes Weena with him on an expedition to ""The Palace of Green Porcelain"", a distant structure which turns out to be a derelict museum. Here, the Traveller finds fresh matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to recover his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time to save her from the horrors of the future world. Because the tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are eventually attacked by Morlocks, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he left behind them to repel the Morlocks turns into aforest fire; Weena and the Morlocks are lost in the blaze.

The Morlocks openthe Sphinxand use the machine as bait to capture the distraught Traveller, not understanding that he can use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before travelling further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There, he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: crab-like creatures wandering blood-red beaches chasing enormousbutterflies, in a world covered in lichenoid vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation cease and the sun growlarger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last living things die out.

Overwhelmed, he returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two unusual white flowers Weena put in his pocket.

The original narrator relates that he returned to the Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. After waiting for three years, however, the narrator says that the Traveller has not returned.

A section from the thirteenth chapter of the serial published inNew Review(May 1895, partway down p. 577 to p. 580, line 29)[22]does not appear in either of the 1895 editions of the book.[23][24][25]It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor,William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to ""oblige your editor"" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of ""the ultimate degeneracy"" of humanity. ""There was a slight struggle,"" Wells later recalled, ""between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text.""[26]This portion of the story was published elsewhere as ""The Final Men"" (1940)[27]and ""The Grey Man"".[28]The deleted text was also published byForrest J Ackermanin an issue of the American edition ofPerry Rhodan.[citation needed]

The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks. He finds himself in the distant future in a frost-coveredmoorlandwith simple grasses and black bushes, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resemblingkangaroos. He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-likearthropodapproaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid. TheDover Press[29]andEaston Presseditions of the novella restore this deleted segment.[citation needed]

Significant scholarly commentary onThe Time Machinebegan from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi'sThe Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances) and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas'sThe Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.[citation needed]

A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print asH.G. Wells's Perennial Time Machine.[30]This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level:H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide.[31]

The scholarly journalThe Wellsianhas published around twenty articles onThe Time Machine, and a U.S. academic journalThe Undying Fire, devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002.[citation needed][32]

According to Leon Stover in his bookThe Time Machine: An invention name, the nameEloiis the Hebrew plural forElohim, or lesser gods, in theOld Testament.[33]However, this derivation is unlikely as the word 'Elohim' is already in the plural, with the singular being 'eloah'.[34]

Wells's source for the nameMorlockis less clear. It may refer to theCanaanitegodMolochassociated with child sacrifice. The nameMorlockmay also be a play onmollocks– what miners might call themselves – or a Scots word for rubbish,[33]or a reference to theMorlacchicommunity in Dalmatia.[35]

The Time Machinecan be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.

The CBS radio anthologyEscapeadaptedThe Time Machinetwice, in 1948 starringJeff Corey, and again in 1950 starringLawrence Dobkinas the traveller. A script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used in both episodes. The Time Traveller was named Dudley and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they travelled to the year 100,080.

In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starringLeonard Nimoyas the Time Traveller (namedJohnin this adaptation) andJohn de Lancieas David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie andKeegan de Lancie, played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.

In 2000, Alan Young readThe Time Machinefor 7th Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells's novella.[37]

Robert Glenisterstarred as the Time Traveller, withWilliam GauntasH. G. Wellsin a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed byJeremy Mortimeras part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22 February 2009 onBBC Radio 3[38]and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.

The other cast members were:

The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the US journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof ofBroadcasting Houseduringthe Blitz. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30 million AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.

On 5 September 2017,Big Finish Productionsreleased an adaptation ofThe Time Machine. This adaptation was written byMarc Plattand starredBen Milesas the Time Traveller.

Platt explained in an interview that adaptingThe Time Machineto audio was not much different from writingDoctor Who, and that he could see where some of the roots of earlyDoctor Whocame from.[39]

The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast fromAlexandra Palaceon 25 January 1949 by theBBC, which starredRussell Napieras the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.[40]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60976,Rip Van Winkle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle,"Rip Van Winkle, a Dutch American man with a habit of avoiding useful work, lives in a village at the foot of theCatskill Mountainsin the years before theAmerican Revolution. One day, he goes squirrel hunting in the mountains with his dog, Wolf, to escape his wife's irritation. As evening falls, he hears a voice calling his name and finds a man dressed in old-fashioned Dutch clothing and carrying akeg. Rip helps the man carry his burden to a cleft in the rocks from which thunderous noises are emanating; the source proves to be a group of bearded men wearing similar outfits playingnine-pin bowling. Not asking who these men are or how they know his name, Rip joins them in drinking bottles of alcohol from the keg he has helped carry and soon becomes so drunk that he falls asleep.

Rip awakens on a sunny morning, at the spot where he first saw the keg-carrier, and finds that many drastic changes have occurred; his beard is a foot long and has turned grey, hismusketis badly deteriorated, and Wolf is nowhere to be found. Returning to his village, he discovers it to be larger than he remembers and filled with people in unfamiliar clothing, none of whom recognize him. When asked how he voted in the election that has just been held, he declares himself a loyal subject ofGeorge III, unaware that theAmerican Revolutionary Warhas taken place in his absence. He learns that many of his old friends either were killed in the war or have left the village and is disturbed to find a young man who shares his name, mannerisms, and younger appearance. A young woman states that her father is Rip Van Winkle, who has been missing for 21 years, and an old woman recognises him as Rip. The young woman and the young Rip are his children, and the former has named her infant son after him as well.

Rip discovers that his wife has been dead for some time but is not saddened by the news. He learns via a village elder that the men he met in the mountains are told to be ghosts of the crew of theDutch East India CompanyshipHalve Maen. His daughter takes him into her home, and he soon resumes his usual idleness (unconcerned by the major political changes during his slumber) and begins telling his story to every stranger who visits the village. The tale is solemnly taken to heart (despite some assuming him to be insane) by the settlers, particularly by the old Dutch inhabitants who say that, whenever thunder is heard, the men in the mountains must be playing ninepins.

After a failed business venture with his brothers, Irving filed for bankruptcy in 1818.[3]Despondent, he turned to writing for possible financial support, although he haddifficulty thinking of stories to write. He stayed inBirmingham, England, where his brother-in-lawHenry van Warthad opened a trading firm.[4]The two were reminiscing in June 1818 when Irving was suddenly inspired by their nostalgic conversation.[5]Irving locked himself in his room and wrote nonstop all night. As he said, he felt like a man waking from a long sleep. He presented the first draft of ""Rip Van Winkle"" to the van Wart family over breakfast.[6]

""Rip Van Winkle"" was one of the first stories Irving proposed for his new bookThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.Irving asked his brother Ebenezer to assist with publication in the United States. As Irving wrote, ""I shall feel very anxious to hear of the success of this first re-appearance on the literary stage – Should it be successful, I trust I shall be able henceforth to keep up an occasional fire.""[7][8]A British edition was published shortly afterward, by John Miller, who went out of business immediately thereafter. With help from his friendWalter Scott, Irving was able to convinceJohn Murrayto take over British publication of theSketch Book.[9]

Following the success of ""Rip Van Winkle"" in print and onstage, later celebrated editions were illustrated byArthur Rackham(Heinemann, 1905) andN.C. Wyeth(McKay, 1921).

The story of ""Rip Van Winkle"" itself is widely thought to have been based onJohann Karl Christoph Nachtigal's German folktale ""Peter Klaus"",[5][10]which is a shorter story set in a German village. It tells of a goatherd named Peter Klaus who goes looking for a lost goat. He finds some men drinking in the woods and after drinking some of their wine, falls asleep. When he wakes up, twenty years have passed.[5][11]

The story also bears some similarities to stories from East Asia, including the third-century AD Chinese tale of ""Ranka"", as retold byLionel GilesinA Gallery of Chinese Immortals, and the eighth-centuryJapanese tale""Urashima Tarō"".[10]The Hindu story ofMuchukundafrom theBhagavatamalso displays many similarities to the story of ""Rip Van Winkle"".[12][13]

In Christian tradition, there is a similar, well-known story of ""TheSeven SleepersofEphesus"", which recounts a group of early Christians who hid in a cave circa 250 AD to escape the persecution of Christians during the reign of theRomanemperorDecius. They fell into a miraculous sleep and woke some 200 years later during the reign ofTheodosius IIto discover that the city and the whole Empire had become Christian.[10]This Christian story is recounted byIslamand appears in a famousSuraof theQuran, SuraAl-Kahf.[14]The version recalls a group of young monotheists escaping from persecution within a cave and emerging hundreds of years later.[15]

One story in Judaism concernsHoni HaMe'agel, a miracle-working sage of the 1st century BC, who was a historical character but to whom various myths were attached. While traveling one day, Honi saw a man planting acarobtree and asked him about it. The man explained that the tree would take 70 years to bear fruit and that he was planting it not for himself but for the generations to follow him. Later that day, Honi sat down to rest but fell asleep for 70 years; when he awoke, he saw a man picking fruit from a fully mature carob tree. Asked whether he had planted it, the man replied that he had not but that his grandfather had planted it for him.[16][17]

Another similar story in the Islamic tradition is ofUzair(usually identified with the BiblicalEzra), whose grief at theDestruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonianswas so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness, and she could see again. He meets his son, who recognizes him by a mole between his shoulders and is older than he was.[18][19](seeUzair#Islamic tradition and literature).

Albert Einstein'stheory of relativity, under which a person traveling at near light speed would experience only the passage of a few years but would return to find centuries had passed on Earth, provides a broad new scope to express essentially the same literary theme – for example, in the opening chapter ofUrsula K. Le Guin'sRocannon's World. InRobert Heinlein'sTime for the Stars, Earth sends out a fleet of relativistic ships to explore the galaxy, their crews hailed as stalwart pioneers – but after a century, which they experience as only a few years, faster-than-light ships are developed and the earlier ones are recalled, their crews discovering that they had become unwanted anachronisms on a changed Earth. The protagonist notices a newspaper headline disparagingly announcing the arrival of himself and his shipmates as ""yet another crew of Rip Van Winkles"".

In the tenth chapter of his bookLives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, the third-century AD Greek historianDiogenes Laërtiusrelates the story of the legendary sageEpimenides of Knossos, who was said to have been a shepherd on the island ofCrete.[20][21]One day, Epimenides followed after a sheep that had wandered off and after becoming tired, went into a cave underMount Idaand fell asleep. When he awoke, he continued searching for the sheep but could not find it, so he returned to his father's farm, only to discover that it was under new ownership. He went home, only to discover that the people there did not know him. Finally, he encountered his younger brother, who had become an old man, and learned that he had been asleep in the cave for fifty-seven years.[20][21]According to the different sources that Diogenes relates, Epimenides lived to be 154, 157, or 299 years old.[22]Multiple sources have identified the story of Epimenides as the earliest known variant of the ""Rip Van Winkle"" fairy tale.[20][21][23][10][24]

The theme is taken up in numerous modern works of science fiction. InH. G. Wells'sThe Sleeper Awakes, a man who sleeps for 203 years wakes up in a completely transformed London, where he has become the richest man in the world. In the originalBuck Rogersbook, the protagonist falls asleep under the influence of a gas in a mine, sleeps for four centuries, and wakes to find America under the rule of Mongol invaders – whereupon he places himself at the head of the freedom fighters. InRoger Zelazny'sscience-fantasyseriesThe Chronicles of Amber, protagonist Corwyn experiences drinking and revelry in an underground lair with otherworldly people who try to entice him into slumber; he knows this is a centuries-of-sleep trap and resists; the passage is similar in theme to both ""Rip Van Winkle"" and especially the Orkney story. The movieTime Trapalso bears some similarities.

The story has been adapted for other media over the past two centuries, in cartoons, films, stage plays, music, and other media.

There is astatue of Rip Van Winklein Irvington, New York. A sculpture of Rip Van Winkle can also be found near the summit of theHunter Mountain Ski Resortin the Catskills.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17489,Les misérables Tome I: Fantine (French),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables,"In 1815Digne, the peasantJean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in theBagne of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.

Digne's benevolentBishop Myrielgives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.

Valjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-soucoin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and panics, searching the city for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him because if he is apprehended, he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.

Six years pass, and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor ofMontreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, InspectorJavert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.

Years earlier in Paris, agrisettenamedFantinewas very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle, were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès's daughter,Cosette. When Fantine arrives atMontfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of theThénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.

Fantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate, and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth and resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.

Adandynamed Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists, but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.

Javert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.

After Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.

Valjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in theBagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.

Valjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her while pampering their own daughters,ÉponineandAzelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to give Cosette a present of an expensive new doll, which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behavior, caring only that he pays for his food and lodging.

The next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back towards home.

Valjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at the Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette, and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener, and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.

Eight years later, theFriends of the ABC, led byEnjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanistcivil unrest (i.e., theParis uprising on 5–6 June 1832, a setting contrary to the popular notion that the book is set in the 1789French Revolution)[29][30]following the death ofLamarque, a popular general known for his sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of theCour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son,Gavroche, who is astreet urchin.

One of the students,Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially hisroyalistgrandfather, M. Gillenormand) because of hisBonapartistviews. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life atWaterloo—in reality, Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant underNapoleonto avoid exposing himself as a robber.

At theLuxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname Jondrette at the Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.

Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing ""The Cops Are Here"" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the ""Jondrettes"" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).

The philanthropist and his daughter—actually Valjean and Cosette—enter. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises to return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid ofPatron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.

Marius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him, revealing his true identity. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.

He tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, saying they will keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone and announces the address is a fake.

It is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier, and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.

He arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (exceptClaquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, andMontparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.

After Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at ""the Field of the Lark"" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette, andBrujonmanage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean and Cosette's house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week, which greatly troubles the pair.

The next day, Valjean is sitting in theChamp de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap. It says, ""Move Out."" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes home, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and restates that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses to consent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.

The following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that he is a spy. When Enjolras confronts Javert about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius returns to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet but finds it no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.

When Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot him. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, and a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.

Marius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for him earlier calls him by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.

The author also tells the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to having obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him but deciding to do so for fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was ""a little bit in love"" with him, and dies.

Marius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is from Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.

Valjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still uncertain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.

Valjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier doesn't recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean's and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can determine his identity later. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer to distract the policeman who has been pursuing him.

Upon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly, Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks for a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window, he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but cannot ignore his duty to the law either. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into theSeine.

Marius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris duringMardi Grasfestivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius's judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.

Thénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean by revealing all the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is a murderer and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier about his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America, where he becomes a slave trader.

As they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab inPère Lachaise Cemetery."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097,The Sign of the Four,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four,"In 1888 MissMary Morstanarrives with a case. She explains that ten years earlier, her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, disappeared immediately after arriving in London. Mary contacted his friend, Major Sholto, who denied having seen him. Four years later, she received a valuable pearl in the post, a gift repeated once a year for six years. With the sixth pearl, she received a letter asking for a meeting, claiming that she is a ""wronged woman"".

Holmes takes the case, and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died a week before Mary received the first pearl. The only further clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk, appended with the words ""The Sign of the Four: Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar,"" and four small cross-like symbols.

Following the letter's instructions, Holmes, Watson, and Mary go to theLyceum Theatre; there, they meet a coachman who takes them to the house of Major Sholto's son Thaddeus, the anonymous sender of the pearls. He reveals that Captain Morstan did, in fact, visit Major Sholto, demanding his half of a treasure that Sholto had secretly brought back fromIndia. In the ensuing quarrel, Captain Morstan suffered a heart attack and died, striking his head on the treasure box as he fell. Afraid he would be suspected of murder, Major Sholto buried the body and hid the treasure, leaving out a small goldchapletstudded with twelve pearls. Thaddeus and his twin brother Bartholomew only learned of this when their father revealed it while on his deathbed; he was about to reveal to them where the treasure was hidden, when a bearded man appeared at the window and the Major died of fear. The brothers tried and failed to catch the intruder; later on, they found a note pinned to the Major's body, which read ""The Sign of Four"". Thaddeus began sending Mary the pearls to make things right, and the brothers searched for the treasure. Six years later, Bartholomew found and withheld it; Thaddeus then contacted Mary so they could both confront Bartholomew and demand their shares.

The party, now accompanied by Thaddeus, heads to Bartholomew's house, Pondicherry Lodge,Upper Norwood. As they enter the house, the worried housekeeper reveals that Bartholomew has locked himself in his laboratory and refuses to come out. Mary Morstan stays downstairs to comfort the housekeeper, while the others rush up to the laboratory door; through the keyhole, they can see Bartholomew Sholto slumped in his chair,  with a ""fixed and unnatural grin"" upon his face. Holmes and Watson break down the door, to discover Bartholomew in a state ofrigor mortis. Upon further inspection of the body, Holmes discovers a poisonous thorn above Bartholomew's ear. The treasure box is also gone, though there is a hole in the ceiling where it used to be.

While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces from footmarks and other clues that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged white man named Jonathan Small, and a smallAndamaneseaccomplice, who accidentally stepped increosote. Borrowing Toby, a trained scent hound, from a naturalist, Holmes traces the pair to a boat landing. Learning that Small has hired a steamlaunchnamed theAurora, Holmes, with the help of theBaker Street Irregularsand his own disguises, traces the boat to arepair yard. In a police launch, Holmes and Watson pursue theAurorawhen it flees the yard; the islander attempts to shoot a dart at Holmes, and is shot dead himself. Small attempts to flee, running theAuroraaground, but is captured. However, the treasure box is now empty; Small, not wanting to surrender the gems, had scattered them into theThamesduring the chase.

Small confesses that he was once a soldier of the ThirdBuffsin India, and lost his right leg to acrocodilewhile bathing in theGanges. He then became an overseer on anindigoplantation; the1857 rebellionoccurred, and he was forced to flee to theAgra fortress. While standing guard one night, he was overpowered bySikhtroopers, who gave him a choice; be killed, or help themwaylayAchmet, a disguised servant of an outlawedrajah, who had sent Achmet with a box of jewellery to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place, but the crime was discovered, although the hidden jewels were not. Small and his accomplices got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands.

Some years later, Small learned that Major Sholto and Captain Morstan, who were guards at the convict barracks, had lost money playing cards. Small saw his chance, and made a deal with the officers; Sholto would recover the treasure, and in return send a boat to pick up Morstan, Small, and the Sikhs so they could all meet and divide it. However, Sholto stole the treasure for himself, returning to England after inheriting a fortune from his uncle. Morstan went after Sholto but never returned, and Small vowed vengeance against Sholto. Four years later, Small escaped prison with the help of Tonga, an islander whose life he had once saved. It was the news of this escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location, but left the note in the room anyway as revenge for the treatment of himself and the Sikhs. When Bartholomew eventually found the treasure, Small only planned to steal it; however, a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew before Small could stop him. Small decides the treasure brings nothing but bad luck to anyone who has it; to Achmet and Bartholomew, death; to Major Sholto, fear and guilt; and for Small himself, penal servitude for life.

Mary is left with no treasure, save the pearls; however, she and Watson have fallen in love over the course of the adventure, and the loss of the treasure has removed anybarriersthere might have been between them. Watson reveals that he has proposed to Mary and that she has accepted, much to the annoyance of Holmes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyledescribed how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner withJoseph Marshall Stoddart, managing editor of the American publicationLippincott's Monthly Magazine, at theLangham Hotelin London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version ofLippincott’swith a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended byOscar Wilde, who eventually contributedThe Picture of Dorian Grayto the July 1890 issue.[1]Doyle discussed what he called this ""golden evening"" in his 1924autobiographyMemories and Adventures.

The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition ofLippincott's Monthly Magazine[2]asThe Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos, appearing in both London andPhiladelphia.[3]The British edition of the magazine originally sold for ashilling, and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars.

Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re-serialisations gave the title asThe Sign of Four. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 bySpencer Blackett, again using the titleThe Sign of Four.[1]This edition included a frontispiece illustrated byCharles H. M. Kerr.[4]The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second ""the"" of the original title.

AGermanedition of the book published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. An edition published byGeorge Newnes Ltdin 1903 was illustrated byF. H. Townsend.[5]

Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four-word form.[1]The actual text in the novel nearly always uses ""the Sign of the Four"" (the five-word form) to describe the symbol in the story, although the four-word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story.

As with the first story,A Study in Scarlet, produced two years previously,The Sign of the Fourwas not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards inStrand Magazine, that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.

There have been multiple film and television adaptations of the book:

A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on New York radio stationWGYon 9 November 1922. The cast included Edward H. Smith as Sherlock Holmes, F. H. Oliver as Dr. Watson, and Viola Karwowska as Mary Morstan. It was produced as part of a series of adaptations of plays, so it is likely that the script was based on an existing stage adaptation of the story (one was written by John Arthur Fraser in 1901 and another by Charles P. Rice in 1903).[6]

A six-part adaptation of the novel aired in the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Adapted byEdith Meiser, the episodes aired from 9 November 1932 to 14 December 1932, withRichard Gordonas Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.[7]

The book was adapted byFelix Feltonfor theBBC Light Programmein 1959.Richard Hurndallplayed Holmes andBryan Colemanplayed Watson.[8]

On Saturday 2 March 1963, the story was dramatised byMichael Hardwickfor theBBC Home Serviceas part of the1952–1969 radio series, as a ninety-minute episode onSaturday-Night Theatre, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson.[9]

CBS Radio Mystery Theateraired a radio version of the story in 1977, starringKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[10]

The Sign of the Fourwas adapted for radio byBert Coulesin 1989 as part ofBBC Radio 4's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series, withClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, and featuringBrian Blessedas Jonathan Small.[11]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766,David Copperfield,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield,"The story follows the life ofDavid Copperfieldfrom childhood to maturity. David was born inBlunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years residing in a small house called theRookery. His loving and childish mother and their kindly housekeeper,Clara Peggotty, bring him up here, where they call him Davy. When he is seven years old, his mother marriesEdward Murdstonewithout having told him they plan to marry. To get him out of the way, David is sent to visit Peggotty's family inYarmouth. Her brother, fishermanMr Peggotty, lives in a beached barge, with his adopted niece and nephew Emily andHam, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. ""Little Em'ly"" is somewhat spoiled by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. They call him Master Copperfield.

On his return, David discovers his mother has married and is immediately given good reason to dislike his stepfather, Murdstone, who believes exclusively in stern, harsh methods of parenting, calling it ""firmness"". David has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them, they tyrannise David and his poor mother, making their lives miserable. When David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone thrashes him, and David bites his hand; in consequence, he is sent away to Salem House, a boarding school, under a ruthless headmaster named Mr Creakle. There he is befriended by an older boy,James Steerforth, andTommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as someone noble, who could do great things if he would, and one who pays attention to him.

David goes home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the localcarrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London – a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. After some months, David's friendly but spendthrift landlord,Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to theKing's Bench Prison, and the rest of Mr. Micawber's family soon moves to the Prison too.  David visits the Micawbers regularly at the Prison, and boards nearby.  When Micawber's release is imminent, the Micawbers decide they will soon move toPlymouth.  David realises that will leave him alone in London, where no one cares about him.  He makes up his mind to run away toDoverto find his only known remaining relative, his eccentric and kind-hearted great-auntBetsey Trotwood.  She had come to Blunderstone at his birth, only to depart in ire upon learning that he was not a girl. However, she takes it upon herself to raise David, despite Murdstone's attempt to regain custody of him. She encourages him to 'be as like his sister, 'Betsey Trotwood' as he can be – that is, to meet the expectations she had for the girl who was never born. David's great-aunt renames him ""Trotwood Copperfield"" and addresses him as ""Trot"", one of several names others call David in the novel.

David's aunt sends him to a better school than the last he attended. It is run by kind Dr. Strong, whose methods inculcate honour and self-reliance in his pupils. During term, David lodges with the lawyer Mr Wickfield and his daughterAgnes, who becomes David's friend and confidante. Wickfield's clerk,Uriah Heep, also lives at the house.

By devious means, Uriah Heep gradually gains a complete ascendancy over the aging and alcoholic Wickfield, to Agnes's great sorrow. Heep, as he maliciously confides to David, aspires to marry Agnes. Ultimately with the aid of Micawber, who has been employed by Heep as a secretary, his fraudulent behaviour is revealed. (At the end of the book, David encounters him in prison, convicted of attempting to defraud theBank of England.)

After completing school, David apprentices to be aproctor. During this time, due to Heep's fraudulent activities, his aunt's fortune has diminished. David toils to make a living. He works mornings and evenings for his former teacher Dr Strong as a secretary, and also starts to learnshorthand, with the help of his old school-friend Traddles, upon completion reporting parliamentary debate for a newspaper. With considerable moral support from Agnes and his own great diligence and hard work, David ultimately finds fame and fortune as an author, writing fiction.

David's romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, also re-acquainted with David, goes on to seduce and dishonour Emily, offering to marry her off to his manservant Littimer before deserting her in Europe. Her uncle Mr Peggotty manages to find her with the help of Martha, who had grown up in their part of England and then settled in London. Ham, who had been engaged to marry Emily before the tragedy, dies in a fierce storm off the coast while rescuing shipwreck victims. Steerforth was aboard the ship and also dies. Mr Peggotty takes Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by Mrs Gummidge and the Micawbers, where all eventually find security and happiness.

Meanwhile, David has fallen in love withDora Spenlow, and marries her. Their marriage proves troublesome for David in the sense of everyday practical affairs, but he never stops loving her. Dora dies early in their marriage after a miscarriage. After Dora's death, Agnes encourages David to return to normal life and his profession of writing. While living in Switzerland to dispel his grief over so many losses, David realises that he loves Agnes. Upon returning to Britain, after a failed attempt to conceal his feelings, David finds that Agnes loves him too. They quickly marry, and in this marriage he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have at least five children, including a daughter named after his great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.

Between 1845 and 1848, Dickens wrote fragments of autobiography, excerpts of which he showed to his wife andJohn Forster. Then in 1855 he made an attempt at revising it. This was a failure because, as he tells his first love Maria Beadnell (now Mrs Winter), when he began dealing with his youthful love for her, ""I lost courage and burned the rest"".[12][13]Paul Schlicke points out that in fact not all the pages have gone through the flames and that, as Dickens began writingDavid Copperfieldsome pages were unearthed. Proof of this is found in the eleventh chapter of the novel: ""I begin Life on my own Account and don't like it"", where the story of Dickens's experience at the Warren Shoe Factory is told almost verbatim, with the only change, ""Mr Micawber"" instead of ""my father"".[4]John Forster also published substantial extracts relating to this period in Dickens's biography, including a paragraph devoted to Wellington House College, which corresponds with the second stage of childhood recounted in the novel.[14]Thus Dickens looks back on his painful past, already evoked by the martyrdom of Little Paul inDombey and Son, though voiced by anomniscient narratorin that earlier novel.[15]Until Forster published his biography of Dickens in 1872–1874, no one knew that Dickens had worked in a factory as a child, not even his wife, until Dickens wrote it down and gave the papers to Forster in 1847.[16]The first generations of readers did not know this part of David Copperfield's story began like an incident in the author's life.

IfDavid Copperfieldhas come to be Dickens's ""darling"", it is because it is the most autobiographical of all his novels.[17]Some of the most painful episodes of his life are barely disguised; others appear indirectly, termed ""oblique revelations"" by Paul Davis.[17]However, Dickens himself wrote to Forster that the book is not a pure autobiography, but ""a very complicated weaving of truth and invention"".[3]

The most important autobiographical material concerns the months that Dickens, still a child, spent at the Warren factory, his diligence with his first love, Maria Beadnell (seeCatherine DickensandEllen Ternan), and finally his career as a journalist and writer. As pointed out by his biographer and friend John Forster, these episodes are essentially factual: the description of forced labour to which David is subjected at Murdstone and Grinby reproduces verbatim the autobiographical fragments entrusted to his friend; David's fascination with Dora Spenlow is similar to that inspired by the capricious Maria; the major stages of his career, from his apprenticeship atDoctors' Commonsto writing his first novel, via theshorthandreporting of parliamentary procedures, also follow those of its creator.[17]

However, this material, like the other autobiographical aspects of the novel, is not systematically reproduced as such. The cruel Mr Murdstone is very different from the real James Lamert, cousin to Dickens, being the stepson of Mrs Dickens's mother's sister, who lived with the family inChathamandCamden Town, and who had found for the young Charles the place of tagger in the shoe factory he managed for his brother-in-law George.[18]The end of this episode looks nothing like what happens in the novel; in reality, contrary to the desire of his mother that he continue to work, it is his father who took him out of the warehouse to send him to school. Contrary to Charles's frustrated love for Maria Beadnell, who pushed him back in front of his parents' opposition, David, in the novel, marries Dora Spenlow and, with satisfactionex post facto, writes Paul Davis, virtually ""kills"" the recalcitrant stepfather.[17]Finally, David's literary career seems less agitated than that of Dickens, and his results are much less spectacular. David's natural modesty alone does not explain all these changes; Paul Davis expresses the opinion that Dickens recounts his life as he would have liked it, and along with ""conscious artistry"", Dickens knows how to borrow data, integrate them to his original purpose and transform them according to the novelistic necessities, so that ""In the end, Copperfield is David's autobiography, not Dickens's"".[17]

David Copperfieldis the contemporary of two major memory-based works,William Wordsworth'sThe Prelude(1850), an autobiographical poem about the formative experiences of his youth andTennyson'sIn Memoriam(1850) whicheulogisesthe memory of his friend,Arthur Hallam.[19][N 2]There isWordsworth's romantic questioningon the personal development of the individual and there is Tennyson'sVictorianconfrontation with change and doubt. According to Andrew Sanders,David Copperfieldreflects both types of response, which give this novel the privileged position of representing the hinge of the century.[20]

The memories of Dickens are, according to Paul Schlicke, remarkably transmuted into fiction.[19]The experience Dickens lived, as the son of a brazen impenitent, is celebrated through the comic figure of Wilkins Micawber. Dickens's youthful passion for Maria Beadnell resurfaces with tenderness, in the form of David's impractical marriage with Dora Spenlow. Dickens's decision to make David a novelist emphasises how he used this book to re-invent himself as a man and artist, ""The world would not take another Pickwick from me, but we can be cheerful and merry, and with a little more purpose in us"".[21]If the preoccupation with the adventures of a hero, associated with a parade of comic or grotesque characters, looks back to Dickens's earlier novels, the interest in personal development, the pessimistic atmosphere and the complex structure ofCopperfieldforeshadow other novels.[19]

Despite never living there, Dickens knew the City of Canterbury well and includes numerous references to it.[22]David Copperfield regularly visits the cathedral services at Canterbury Cathedral,[23]and Mr Micawber wants his son to become a chorister. The Guildhall[24]is mentioned when David Copperfield is asked by the barrister to visit. Dr Strong and Annie Markleham get married at St Alphege church,[25]which is also situated prominently in Canterbury.

In 1847,Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë's first-person narrative, was acclaimed as soon as it was published. Unlike Thackeray, who adored it, Dickens claims years later never to have read it.[26]True or false, he had encounteredElizabeth Gaskell'sMary Barton, a novel that called for understanding and sympathy in a class-eaten society.[27]Thackeray'sPendenniswas serialised at the same time asDavid Copperfieldand it depicts its hero's personal and social journey from the countryside to the city. A rivalry existed between the two writers, though it preoccupied Thackeray more than Dickens. The most direct literary influence is ""obviously Carlyle"" who, in a lecture given in 1840, the year of his meeting with Dickens, on ""On Heroes, Hero-Worship"" and ""the Heroic in History"", claims that the most important modern character is ""the hero as a man of letters"".[28][29][20]This is David's destiny, through experience, perseverance and seriousness.[28]

On 7 January 1849, Dickens visitedNorwichandYarmouthinNorfolk, with two close friends,John Leech(1817–1864) andMark Lemon(1809–1870).[30]Leech was an illustrator atPunch, a satirical magazine, and the first illustrator forA Christmas Carolby Dickens in 1843. Lemon was a founding editor ofPunch, and soon a contributor toHousehold Words, the weekly magazine Dickens was starting up; he co-authoredMr Nightingale's Diary, a farce, with Dickens in 1851.[31][32]The two towns, especially the second, became important in the novel, and Dickens informed Forster that Yarmouth seemed to him to be ""the strangest place in the world"" and that he would ""certainly try my hand at it"".[33]During a walk in the vicinity of Yarmouth, Dickens noticed a sign indicating the small locality of Blundeston, which became in his novel the village of ""Blunderstone"" where David is born and spends his childhood.[15]

A week after his arrival in Yarmouth, his sixth son,Henry Fielding Dickens, was named afterHenry Fielding, his favourite past author. Per Forster, Dickens refers to Fielding ""as a kind of homage to the novel he was about to write"".[34]

As always with Dickens, when a writing project began, he was agitated, melancholic, ""even deeper than the customary birth pangs of other novels"";[34]as always, he hesitated about the title, and his working notes contain seventeen variants, ""Charles Copperfield"" included.[15]After several attempts, he stopped on ""The Copperfield Survey of the World as it Rolled"", a title that he retained until 19 April.[35]When Forster pointed out that his hero, now called David, has his own initials transposed, Dickens was intrigued and declared that this was a manifestation of hisfate.[34]He was not yet sure of his pen: ""Though I know what I want to do, I am lumbering like a train wagon"",[36]he told Forster.

Contrary to the method previously used forDombey and Son, Dickens did not elaborate an overall plan and often wrote the summary of a chapter after completing it. Four character names were found at the last moment: Traddles, Barkis, Creakle and Steerforth;[37]the profession of David remains uncertain until the eighth issue (printed in December 1849, containing Chapters 22–24, in which David chooses to be trained as a proctor); and Paul Schlicke notes that the future of Dora was still not determined on 17 May 1850 (when 37 chapters had been published in the first 12 monthly instalments). Other major aspects of the novel, however, were immediately fixed, such as David's meeting with Aunt Betsey, Emily's fall or Agnes's role as the ""real"" heroine of the story.[10]

Once launched, Dickens becomes ""quite confident"".[38]The most difficult thing was to insert ""what I know so well"", his experience at the Warren factory; once the threads were woven, however, the truth mixed with fiction, he exulted and congratulated himself in a letter to Forster.[39]From now on, he wrote in this letter, the story ""bore him irresistibly along"". Never, it seems, was he in the grip of failures of inspiration, so ""ardent [is his] sympathy with the creatures of the fancy which always made real to him their sufferings or sorrows.""[34]

Changes in detail occur during the composition: on 22 August 1849, while staying on theIsle of Wightfor a family vacation, he changed on the advice of Forster, the theme of the obsession of Mr Dick, a secondary character in the novel. This theme was originally ""a bull in a china shop"" and became ""King Charles's head"" in a nod to the bicentenary of the execution ofCharles I of England.[N 3][10]

Although plunged into the writing of his novel, Dickens set out to create a new journal,Household Words,[40]the first issue of which appeared on 31 March 1850. This daunting task, however, did not seem to slow down the writing ofDavid Copperfield: I am ""busy as a bee"", he writes happily to the actorWilliam Macready.[41]

A serious incident occurred in December: Mrs Jane Seymour Hill,chiropractortoMrs Dickens,[42]raised the threat of prosecution, because she recognised herself in the portrait of Miss Mowcher; Dickens did not do badly,[43]gradually modifying the psychology of the character by making her less of a caricature and, at the very end of the novel, by making her a friend of the protagonist, whereas at the beginning she served rather contrary purposes.[42]This was, writes Harry Stone, ""the only major departure from his original plans"".[44]

His third daughter was born on 16 August 1850, called Dora Annie Dickens, the same name as his character's first wife. The baby died nine months later after the last serial was issued and the book was published.[10]

Dickens marked the end of his manuscript on 21 October 1850[10]and felt both torn and happy like every time he finished a novel: ""Oh, my dear Forster, if I were to say half of whatCopperfieldmakes me feel to-night, how strangely, even to you, I should be turned inside out! I seem to be sending some part of myself into the Shadowy World.""[45][10]

At first glance, the work is modelled in the loose and somewhat disjointed way of ""personal histories"" that was very popular in the United Kingdom of the 18th century;[N 4]but in reality,David Copperfieldis a carefully structured and unified novel. It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a rather bleak painting of the conditions of childhood in Victorian England, notoriously when the troublesome children are parked in infamous boarding schools, then he strives to trace the slow social and intimate ascent of a young man who, painfully providing for the needs of his good aunt while continuing his studies, ends up becoming a writer: the story, writes Paul Davis, of ""a Victorian everyman seeking self-understanding"".[9]

""The Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger, of Blunderstone Rookery""[N 5]was published from 1 May 1849 to 1 November 1850 in 19 monthly one-shilling instalments, containing 32 pages of text and two illustrations byHablot Knight Browne (""Phiz""), with a title cover simplified toThe Personal History of David Copperfield. The last instalment was a double-number.

On the other side of the Atlantic,John Wiley & SonsandG. P. Putnampublished a monthly edition, then a two-volume book version.

Whatever the borrowings from Dickens's own life, the reader knows as an essential precondition, thatDavid Copperfieldis a novel and not anautobiography; a work with fictional events and characters – including the hero-narrator – who are creations of Dickens's imagination.

The use of thefirst persondetermines the point of view: thenarratorCopperfield, is a recognised writer, married to Agnes for more than ten years, who has decided to speak in public about his past life. This recreation, in itself an important act, can only be partial and also biased, since,a priori, Copperfield is the only viewpoint and the only voice; not enjoying the prerogatives of the third person, omnipotence, ubiquity, clairvoyance, he relates only what he witnessed or participated in:[46]all the characters appear in his presence or, failing that, he learns through hearsay, before being subjected to his pen through the prism of his conscience, deformed by the natural deficit of his perception and accentuated by the selective filter of memory.[47]Story teller and teacher, Copperfield does not let the facts speak for themselves, but constantly asserts himself as master of the narrative game, and he intervenes, explains, interprets and comments. His point of view is that of the adult he has become, as he expresses himself just as he is writing. At the end of his book, he feels a writer's pride to evoke ""the thread[s] in the web I have spun"".[48]

Gareth Cordery writes that ""ifDavid Copperfieldis the paradigmaticBildungsroman, it is also the quintessential novel of memory""[49]and as such, according to Angus Wilson, the equal ofMarcel Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time(À la recherche du temps perdu).[50]The memory of the hero engages so intensely with his memories that the past seems present:

In such passages, which punctuate the retrospective chapters, the relived moment replaces the lived, thehistorical presentseals the collapse of the original experience and the recreation of a here and now that seizes the entire field of consciousness.[52]Sometimes this resurrected experience is more vivid than reality; so, in Chapter 41, about Traddles's face, he says: ""His honest face, he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality.""[53]These are ""sacred moments"", writes Gareth Cordery, which Copperfield has carefully guarded in ""the treasure chambers""[N 6]of his memory, where sings ""the music of time"":[52]""secret prose, that sense of a mind speaking to itself with no one there to listen"".[54]

Without being Dickens, this narrator, Copperfield, is very like him and often becomes his spokesperson. It adds to his point of view, directly or indirectly, that of the author, without there necessarily being total match between the two. As such, Copperfield serves as ""medium"", mirror and also screen, Dickens sometimes subverting his speech to get to the forefront or, on the contrary, hide behind this elegant delegate to the nimble pen. Dickens's voice, however, is in general well concealed and, according to Gareth Cordery, the most difficult to detect because mostly present by implication.[55]To help hear his voice, he adds, it is advisable to turn to Phiz, whose illustrations bring a point of view which is not always in agreement with that of Copperfield. For example, in chapter 21, the two friends arrive by surprise at the Peggotty home, and Copperfield presents Steerforth to Emily at the very moment when her betrothal with Ham has just been announced. This sudden intrusion stops the girl as she has just jumped from Ham's arms to nestle in those of Mr Peggotty, a sign, says Cordery in passing, that the promise of marriage is as much for the uncle as for the nephew. The text remains brief but Phiz interprets, anticipates the events, denounces even the future guilt of Copperfield: all eyes are on the girl, her bonnet, emblem of her social aspirations and her next wanderings with Steerforth, is ready to be seized. Copperfield, dressed as a gentleman, stands in the doorway, one finger pointing at Steerforth who is taller by one head, the other measuring the gap between Ham and Dan Peggotty, as if offering Emily to his friend. Emily, meanwhile, still has her head turned to Ham but the body is withdrawn and the look has become both challenging and provocative. Phiz brings together in a single image a whole bunch of unwritten information, which Dickens approved and probably even suggested.[56]

A third perspective is the point of view of the discerning reader who, although generally carried away by sympathy for the narrator's self-interested pleading, does not remain blissfully ignorant and ends up recognizing the faults of the man and of the writer, just as the reader also learns to identify and gauge the covert interventions of the author.

The discerning reader listens to the adult Copperfield and hears what this adult wants or does not want them to hear. ""Even though this manuscript is intended for no eyes but mine"", (chapter 42)[57]the book exists, and the reader becomesipso factoa ""father-confessor"",[52]knowing how to judge and even, at times, to doubt the sincerity of the emotion expressed. So, when Dora dies, the reader sees that the topic of grief is dropped in a hurry, as if Copperfield had more important things to do than to indulge in sorrow: ""this is not the time at which I am to enter a state of mind beneath its load of sorrow"",[58]which creates a question and an embarrassment: is Copperfield protecting himself from his confusion, or does he shed some crocodile tears for form?

Copperfield also examines some of his most culpable weaknesses, such as unconscious connivance (his ""own unconscious part"") in the defilement of the Peggotty home by Steerforth, which he remains forever incapable of opposing: ""I believe that if I had been brought face to face with him, I could not have uttered one reproach.""(chapter 32)[59]The same treatment is given to his childhood love, his so much idealised Emily, who, once ""fallen"", is expelled from his consciousness to the point where his last comment, when he stealthily sees her aboard the ship leaving for Australia, is ""a masterpiece of narrative duplicity"": far from seeing in her what she has become, a real woman, he takes refuge behind the image of a pathetic religious icon elegantly allowing him to remove his own guilt for betraying her.[60]

These underground currents are thus revealed in David's psychological struggle, Gareth Cordery concludes, currents that his narrative unconsciously attempts to disguise.[61]

The story is a road from which different paths leave. The road is that of David's life, the main plot; the branches are born of meetings with him and lead to several secondary intrigues taken more or less far along. Each is represented by an important figure: Mr Micawber, Steerforth, little Emily, Uriah Heep; there are side stories, that of Martha Endell, Rosa Dartle, and, along the main road, stretch some parallel paths on which the reader is from time to time invited: the Traddles, Betsey Trotwood, the Peggotty family, Dan and Ham in particular, Peggotty herself remaining from start to finish intimately related to David. The different tracks do not move away from the main avenue, and when they do, a narrative ""forceps"" brings them together again. Hence the retrospective chapters and the ultimate recapitulation were written.[62]

The narrative is linear in appearance, as is usual in traditional first-person form. It covers the narrator's life until the day he decides to put an end to his literary endeavor. However, whole sections of his life are summarised in a few paragraphs, or sometimes just a sentence or two, indicating that three or ten years have passed, or that Dora is dead, necessary to keep the story moving along. Thus, the long stay of reflection in Switzerland which leads to the recognition of love for Agnes, or the lapse of time before the final chapter, are allblanks in the story. Besides the hero, this story concerns important secondary characters such as Mr Micawber or Uriah Heep, or Betsey Trotwood and Traddles, the few facts necessary for abelievable storyare parsimoniously distilled in the final chapters: an impromptu visit to a prison, the unexpected return of Dan Peggotty from the Antipodes; so many false surprises for the narrator who needs them to complete each person's personal story. As such, theepiloguethat represents the last chapter (Ch 64) is a model of the genre, a systematic review, presumably inspired by his memory, without true connection. There is the desire to finish with each one, with forced exclamations and ecstatic observations, scrolling through the lives of those who are frozen in time: Dick with his ""Memorial"" and his kite, Dr Strong and his dictionary, and as a bonus, the news of David's ""least child"", which implies that there have been other children between him and eldest child Agnes of whom the reader has never heard by name. So also goes the story of Dan Peggotty relating the sad tale of his niece. The four chapters called ""Retrospect"" (Chapter 18: ""A Retrospect"", Chapter 43: ""Another Retrospect"", Chapter 53: ""Another Retrospect"" and Chapter 64: ""A Last Retrospect"") are placed at strategic moments of the general discourse, which play a catch-up role more than one of meditation by the narrator, without venturing into event details. Here, the narration has disappeared, it has given way to a list, an enumeration of events.[63]

Dickens's approach, as shown inDavid Copperfield, does not escape whatGeorges Gusdorf[fr]calls ""the original sin of autobiography"", that is to say a restructuringa posterioriand in this, paradoxically, it demonstrates its authenticity.[64]It consists of splitting one's life into parts, choosing decisive phases, identifying an evolution and endowing them with a direction and then a meaning, whereas, from day to day, existence has been lived as a cluster of shapeless perceptions requiring an immediate adaptation, that captures at best in the novel the use of thehistorical presentgenerally adopted by Dickens. It is a succession of autonomous moments which do not end up amalgamating in a coherent whole and that connect the tenuous thread of the ""I"" recognizing each other. In this reconstruction, one part of truth and the other of poetry, the famousDichtung und Wahrheit(From my Life: Poetry and Truth; 1811–1833), autobiography ofGoethe, there is the obligatory absence of objectivity, the promotion of oblivion as an integral part of memory, the ruling power of the subjectivity of time found.[65]

Thus, to use George Gusdorf's words again,David Copperfieldappears as a ""second reading of a man's experience"", in this case, Charles Dickens, when he reached the fullness of his career, tried to give ""a meaning to his legend"".[66]

This novel's main theme arises from the fact that it is abildungsroman, a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of theprotagonistfrom youth to adulthood, which is common in Dickens's novels,[67]and in which character change is extremely important.[68][69]The changes involve David leaving past selves behind on the way to maturity. Other important themes relate especially to Dickens's social concerns, and his desire for reform. This includes the plight of so-called ""fallen women"", and prostitutes, as well as the attitude of middle-class society to these women; the status of women in marriage; the rigid class structure; the prison system; educational standards, and emigration to the colonies of what was becoming theBritish Empire. The latter was a way for individuals to escape some of the rigidity of British society and start anew. Some of these subjects are directly satirized, while others are worked into the novel in more complex ways by Dickens.

Copperfield's path to maturity is marked by the different names assigned to him: his mother calls him ""Davy""; Murdstone calls him as ""Brooks of Sheffield""; for Peggotty's family, he is ""Mas'r Davy""; en route to boarding school from Yarmouth, he appears as ""Master Murdstone""; at Murdstone and Grinby, he is known as ""Master Copperfield""; Mr Micawber is content with ""Copperfield""; for Steerforth he is ""Daisy""; he becomes ""Mister Copperfield"" with Uriah Heep; and ""Trotwood"", soon shortened to ""Trot"" for Aunt Betsey; Mrs Crupp deforms his name into ""Mr Copperfull""; and for Dora he is ""Doady"".[70]While striving to earn his real name once and for all, this plethora of names reflects the fluidity of Copperfield's personal and social relationships, and obscure his real identity. It is by writing his own story, and giving him his name in the title, that Copperfield can finally assert who he is.[70]

David's life can be seen as a series of lives, each one in radical disjunction from what follows, writes Paul Davis.[71]The young boy in the warehouse differs from Blunderstone Rookery's child, or Salem House student, and overall David strives to keep these parts of himself disconnected from each other. For example, in Chapter 17, while attending Canterbury School, he met Mr Micawber at Uriah Heep's, and a sudden terror gripped him that Heep could connect him, such as he is today, and the abandoned child who lodged with the Micawber family in London.[71]

So many mutations indicate the name changes, which are sometimes received with relief: ""Trotwood Copperfield"", when he finds refuge inDoverat his Aunt Betsey's house, so the narrator writes, ""Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me."" Then, he realised ""that a remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life"" and ""that a curtain had for ever fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby's"".[72]

There is a process of forgetfulness, a survival strategy developed by memory, which poses a major challenge to the narrator; his art, in fact, depends on the ultimate reconciliation of differences in order to free and preserve the unified identity of his being a man.

David opens his story with a question: Will I be the hero of my own life? This means that he does not know where his approach will lead him, that writing itself will be the test. As Paul Davis puts it, ""In this Victorian quest narrative, the pen might be lighter than the sword, and the reader will be left to judge those qualities of the man and the writer that constitute heroism.[17]

However, question implies an affirmation: it is Copperfield, and no one else, who will determine his life, the future is delusory, since the games are already played, the life has been lived, with the novel being only the story. Copperfield is not always the hero of his life, and not always the hero of his story, as some characters have a stronger role than him,[73]Besides Steerforth, Heep, Micawber, for example, he often appears passive and lightweight. Hence, concludes Paul Davis, the need to read his life differently; it is more by refraction through other characters that the reader has a true idea of the ""hero"" of the story. What do these three men reveal to him, and also to Dora, whom he marries?[71]Another possible yardstick is a comparison with the other two ""writers"" of the novel, Dr Strong and Mr Dick. The dictionary of Strong will never be completed and, as a story of a life, will end with the death of its author. As for Mr Dick, his autobiographical project constantly raises the question of whether he can transcend the incoherence and indecision of his subject-narrator. Will he be able to take the reins, provide a beginning, a middle, an end? Will he succeed in unifying the whole, in overcoming the trauma of the past, his obsession with the decapitated royal head, so as to make sense of the present and find a direction for the future? According to Paul Davis, only Copperfield succeeds in constructing a whole of his life, including suffering and failure, as well as successes, and that is ""one measure of his heroism as a writer"".[71]

The past ""speaks"" especially to David, ""a child of close observation"" (chapter 2); the title of this chapter is: ""I observe"",[74]and as an adult he is endowed with a remarkable memory.[75]So much so that the story of his childhood is realised so concretely that the narrator, like the reader, sometimes forgets that it is a lived past and not a present that is given to see. Thepast tense verbis often thepreteritefor thenarrative, and the sentences are often short independent propositions, each one stating a fact. Admittedly, the adult narrator intervenes to qualify or provide an explanation, without, however, taking precedence over the child's vision. And sometimes, the story is prolonged by a reflection on the functioning of the memory. So, again in chapter 2, the second and third paragraphs comment on the first memory of the two beings surrounding David, his mother, and Peggotty:

David thus succeeds, asGeorge Orwellputs it, in standing ""both inside and outside a child's mind"",[17]a particularly important double vision effect in the first chapters. The perspective of the child is combined with that of the adult narrator who knows that innocence will be violated and the feeling of security broken. Thus, even before the intrusion of Mr Murdstone as step-father or Clara's death, the boy feels ""intimations of mortality"".[17]In the second chapter for example, when David spends a day with Mr Murdstone, during the first episode of ""Brooks of Sheffield""[N 7][76][77]in which, first blow to his confidence, he realises little by little that Mr Murdstone and his comrade Quinion are mocking him badly:

The final blow, brutal and irremediable this time, is the vision, in chapter 9, of his own reflection in his little dead brother lying on the breast of his mother: ""The mother who lay in the grave was the mother of my infancy; the little creature in her arms was myself, as I had once been, hushed forever on her bosom"".[79]

David Copperfield is aposthumous child, that is, he was born after his father died.[80]From birth, his aunt is the authority who stands in for the deceased father, and she decides Copperfield's identity by abandoning him because he is not female. His first years are spent with women, two Claras,[N 8]his mother and Peggotty, which, according to Paul Davis, ""undermines his sense of masculinity"".[17]Hence a sensitivity that the same critic calls ""feminine"", made-up of a lack of confidence, naive innocence and anxiety, like that of his mother, who was herself an orphan. Steerforth is not mistaken, when from the outset he calls Copperfield ""Daisy""–a flower of spring, symbol of innocent youth. To forge an identity as a man and learn how to survive in a world governed by masculine values, instinctively, he looks for a father figure who can replace that of the father he did not have.

Several male models will successively offer themselves to him: the adults Mr Murdstone, Mr Micawber and Uriah Heep, his comrades Steerforth and Traddles.

Mr Murdstone darkens Copperfield's life instead of enlightening him, because the principle of firmness which he champions, absolute novelty for the initial family unit, if he instills order and discipline, kills spontaneity and love. The resistance that Copperfield offers him is symbolic: opposing a usurper without effective legitimacy, he fails to protect his mother but escapes the straitjacket and achieves his independence. Mr Murdstone thus represents the anti-father, double negative of the one of which David was deprived, modela contrarioof what it is not necessary to be.

The second surrogate father is just as ineffective, although of a diametrically opposed personality: it is Mr Micawber who, for his part, lacks firmness to the point of sinking into irresponsibility. Overflowing with imagination and love, in every way faithful and devoted, inveterate optimist, he eventually becomes, in a way, the child of David who helps him to alleviate his financial difficulties. The roles are reversed and, by the absurdity, David is forced to act as a man and to exercise adult responsibilities towards him. However, the Micawbers are not lacking in charm, the round Wilkins, of course, but also his dry wife, whose music helps her to live. Mrs Micawber has, since childhood, two songs in her repertoire, the Scottish ""The dashing white sergeant""[81]and the American lament ""The little Tafflin with the Silken Sash"",[82]whose attraction has decided her husband to ""win that woman or perish in the attempt""[83]In addition to the melodies that soothe and embellish, the words of the second, with her dream ""Should e'er the fortune be my lot to be made a wealthy bride!"" and heraphorism""Like attracts like"" have become emblematic of the couple, one is the opposite of reality and the other the very definition of its harmony.[84]

New avatar of this quest, Uriah Heep is ""a kind of negative mirror to David"".[71]Heep is clever at enlarging the pathos of his humble origins, for example, which ability he exploits shamelessly to attract sympathy and mask an unscrupulous ambition; while David, on the other hand, tends to suppress his modest past and camouflage his social ambitions under a veneer of worldly mistrust, prompting Paul Davis to conclude that, just as Mr Murdstone is adept at firmness, Heep, in addition to being a rascal, lacks the so-called feminine qualities of sensitivity which David does not lose.[71]

For David, Steerforth represents all that Heep is not: born a gentleman, with no stated ambition or defined life plan, he has a natural presence and charisma that immediately give him scope and power.  However, his failure as a model is announced well before the episode at Yarmouth where he seizes, like a thief, Little Emily before causing her loss in Italy. He already shows himself as he is, brutal, condescending, selfish and sufficient, towards Rosa Dartle, bruised by him for life, and Mr Mell who undergoes the assaults of his cruelty. The paradox is that even as he gauges his infamy, David remains from start to finish dazzled by Steerforth's aristocratic ascendancy, even as he contemplates him drowning on Yarmouth Beach, ""lying with his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him at school"".[85]

Now consider Traddles, the anti-Steerforth, the same age as the hero, not very brilliant at school, but wise enough to avoid the manipulations to which David succumbs. His attraction for moderation and reserve assures him the strength of character that David struggles to forge. Neither rich nor poor, he must also make a place for himself in the world, at which he succeeds by putting love and patience at the center of his priorities, the love that tempers the ambition and the patience that moderates the passion. His ideal is to achieve justice in his actions, which he ends up implementing in his profession practically. In the end, Traddles, in his supreme modesty, represents the best male model available to David.[17]

There are others, Daniel Peggotty for example, all love and dedication, who goes in search of his lost niece and persists in mountains and valleys, beyond the seas and continents, to find her trace. Mr Peggotty is the anti-Murdstone par excellence, but his influence is rather marginal on David, as his absolute excellence, like the maternal perfection embodied by his sister Peggotty, makes him a character type more than an individual to refer to. There is also the carter Barkis, original, laconic and not without defects, but a man of heart. He too plays a role in the personal history of the hero, but in a fashion too episodic to be significant, especially since he dies well before the end of the story.

It is true that David's personal story makes it more difficult for him to access the kind of equilibrium that Traddles presents, because it seems destined, according to Paul Davis, to reproduce the errors committed by his parents.[71]So, without knowing it, he looks a lot like his late father, also named David, who, according to Aunt Betsey, had eyes only for the flower-women, and, as such, he finds himself as irresistibly attracted to Dora whose delicate and charming femininity, the sweet frivolity too, recall those of his diaphanous mother. The chapters describing their loves are among the best in the novel[71]because Dickens manages to capture the painful ambivalence of David, both passionately infatuated with the irresistible young woman, to whom we can only pass and forgive everything, and frustrated by his weak character and his absolute ignorance of any discipline. For love, the supreme illusion of youth, he tries to change it, to ""form her mind"", which leads him to recognize that ""firmness"" can to be a virtue which, ultimately, he needs. However, finding himself in a community of thought, even distantly, with his hateful and cruel stepfather whom he holds responsible for the death of his mother and a good deal of his own misfortunes, it was a troubling discovery.[17]

It is his aunt Betsey who, by her character, represents the struggle to find the right balance between firmness and gentleness, rationality and empathy. Life forced Betsey Trotwood to assume the role she did not want, that of a father, and as such she became, but in her own way, adept at steadfastness and discipline. From an initially culpable intransigence, which led her to abandon the newborn by denouncing the incompetence of the parents not even capable of producing a girl, she finds herself gradually tempered by circumstances and powerfully helped by the ""madness"" of her protege, Mr Dick. He, between two flights of kites that carry away the fragments of his personal history, and without his knowing it, plays a moderating role, inflecting the rationality of his protector by his own irrationality, and his cookie-cutter judgments by considerations of seeming absurdity, but which, taken literally, prove to be innate wisdom. In truth, Aunt Betsey, despite her stiffness and bravado, does not dominate her destiny; she may say she can do it, yet she cannot get David to be a girl, or escape the machinations of Uriah Heep any more than the money demands of her mysterious husband. She also fails, in spite of her lucidity, her clear understanding, of the love blindness of her nephew, to prevent him from marrying Dora and in a parallel way, to reconcile the Strongs. In fact, in supreme irony, it is once again Mr Dick who compensates for his inadequacies, succeeding with intuition and instinctive understanding of things, to direct Mr Micawber to save Betsey from the clutches of Heep and also to dispel the misunderstandings of Dr Strong and his wife Annie.[71]

As often in Dickens where a satellite of the main character reproduces the course in parallel, the story of the Strong couple develops in counterpoint that of David and Dora. While Dora is in agony, David, himself obsessed with his role as a husband, observes the Strongs who are busy unraveling their marital distress. Two statements made by Annie Strong impressed him: in the first, she told him why she rejected Jack Maldon and thanked her husband for saving her ""from the first impulse of an undisciplined heart"".[86]The second was like a flash of revelation: ""There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose"".[86]At the end of chapter 45, almost entirely devoted to the epilogue of this affair, David meditates on these words which he repeats several times and whose relevance, applied to his own case, is imposed on him. He concludes that in all things, discipline tempered by kindness and kindness is necessary for the equilibrium of a successful life. Mr Murdstone preached firmness; in that, he was not wrong. Where he cruelly failed was that he matched it with selfish brutality instead of making it effective by the love of others.[7]

It is because David has taken stock of his values and accepted the painful memories of Dora's death, that he is finally ready to go beyond his emotional blindness and recognize his love for Agnes Wickfield, the one he already has called the ""true heroine"" of the novel to which he gives his name. Paul Davis writes that Agnes is surrounded by an aura of sanctity worthy of a stained glass window, that she is more a consciousness or an ideal than a person, that, certainly, she brings the loving discipline and responsibility of which the hero needs, but lacks the charm and human qualities that made Dora so attractive.[7]Adrienne E Gavin, nuancing the point, writes that she is neither more nor lesscaricaturethan other young women in the hero's life: if Emily is astereotypeof the ""lost woman"" and Dora of ""woman-child"", Agnes is that of ""ideal Victorian woman"", which necessarily limits, for her as for the others, the possibilities of evolution, the only change available from a loving and devoted daughter to a loving and devoted wife.[87]

That said, the writer David, now David Copperfield, realised the vow expressed to Agnes (when he was newly in love with Dora, in Chapter 35. Depression): ""If I had a conjurer's cap, there is no one I should have wished but for you"".[88]At the end of his story, he realises that the conjurer's cap is on his head, that he can draw his attention to the people he loves and trusts. Thus,David Copperfieldis the story of a journey through life and through oneself, but also, by the grace of the writer, the recreation of the tenuous thread uniting the child and the adult, the past and the present, in what Georges Gusdorf calls ""fidelity to the person"".[89]or, as Robert Ferrieux said,[90]

Admittedly, it is not the primary interest ofDavid Copperfieldthat remains above all the story of a life told by the very one who lived it, but the novel is imbued with a dominant ideology, that of themiddle class, advocating moral constancy, hard work,separate spheresfor men and women, and, in general, the art of knowing one's place, indeed staying in that place. Further, some social problems and repeated abuses being topical, Dickens took the opportunity to expose them in his own way in his fiction, and Trevor Blount, in his introduction to the 1966 edition Penguin Classics, reissued in 1985, devotes several pages to this topic.[91]

However, Gareth Cordery shows that behind the display ofVictorianvalues, often hides a watermarked discourse that tends to question, test, and even subvert them.[61]There are therefore two possible readings, the one that remains on the surface and another that questions below this surface, the implicit questions.

Among the social issues thatDavid Copperfieldis concerned with, are prostitution, the prison system, education, as well as society's treatment of the insane.

Dickens's views on education are reflected in the contrast he makes between the harsh treatment that David receives at the hands of Creakle at Salem House and Dr Strong's school where the methods used inculcate honour and self–reliance in its pupils.

Through the character of ""the amiable, innocent, and wise fool"" Mr Dick, Dickens's ""advocacy in the humane treatment of the insane"" can be seen.[92]Mr Dick's brother

So Betsy Trotwood, continuing Mr Dick's story in Chapter 14, stepped in to suggest that Mr Dick should be given ""his little income, and come and live with"" her: ""I am ready to take care of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the asylum-folks) have done.""

The employment of young children in factories and mines under harsh conditions in the early Victorian era disturbed many. There was a series of Parliamentary enquiries into the working conditions of children, and these ""reports shocked writersElizabeth Barrett Browningand Charles Dickens.""[11]Dickens describes children working in factories or other workplaces in several novels, notably inOliver Twist, and inDavid Copperfield. Young David works in a factory for a while after his mother dies and his stepfather showed no interest in him. Such depictions contributed to the call for legislative reform.[11]

Dickens satirises contemporary ideas about how prisoners should be treated in Chapter 61, 'I am Shown Two Interesting Penitents'. In this chapter, published in November 1850, David along with Traddles is shown around a large well-built new prison, modelled onPentonville prison(built in 1842), where a new, supposedly more humane, system of incarceration is in operation, under the management of David's former headmaster Creakle.[93]A believer in firmness, Dickens denounced comically the system of isolating prisoners in separate cells, the ""separate system"", and giving them healthy and pleasant food.[N 9]Hissatireappeals directly to the public, already warned by the long controversy over the prison discipline in the press.[94]Mr Creakle is very proud of this new system, but his enthusiasm is immediately undermined by the reminder of his former ferocity as a school principal. In the prison David and Traddles encounter 'model prisoners' 27 and 28, who they discover are Uriah Heep and Mr Littimer. Heep is seen reading a hymn book and Littimer also ""walked forth, reading a good book"": both have managed to convince the naïve Creakle, and his fellow magistrates, that they have seen the error of their ways. Both are questioned about the quality of the food and Creakle promises improvements.[95]

Dickens's ideas in this chapter were in line withCarlyle, whose pamphlet, ""Model Prisons"", also denounced Pentonville Prison, was published in the spring of 1850.[93]Indeed, Dickens had published anonymously, a month after Carlyle's pamphlet on the same subject, ""Pet Prisonners"".[96]

Dickens's exploration of the subject of emigration in the novel has been criticised, initially byJohn Forsterand later byG. K. Chesterton. Chesterton accused Dickens of presenting emigration in an excessively optimistic light, arguing that Dickens believed that by sending a boatload of people overseas their 'souls' can be changed, while ignoring the fact that poor people like Peggotty have seen their home stained or, like Emily, their honour tarnished. Micawber has been broken by the English social system, his journey to the antipodes is paid for by a paragon of the Victorian bourgeoisie, Betsey Trotwood[97]and he is supposed to regain control of his destiny once he has arrived in Australia.[98]Trevor Blount points out that the word 'soul' has a different meaning for Dickens than Chesterton. Dickens cares about material and psychological happiness, and is convinced that physical well-being is a comfort for life's wounds.

Dickens sent his characters to America inNicholas NicklebyandMartin Chuzzlewit, but he has the Peggotty and Micawber families emigrate to Australia. This approach was part of the official policy of the 1840s, focusing onAustraliaas a land of welcome. It was at this time necessary to stimulate interest in the new colony and propagandists arrived in England in particularJohn Dunmore LangandCaroline Chisholmfrom Australia. Dickens was only following this movement and, in any case, had faith in family colonisation. Moreover, the idea that redemption could be achieved by such a new start in a person's life was a preoccupation of the author, and he saw here subject matter to charm his readers.[99]

From the point of view of the novel's inner logic, in order for Copperfield to complete his psychological maturation and exist independently, Dickens must expel his surrogate fathers, including Peggotty and Micawber, and emigration is an easy way to remove them.[7]

The episode in the prison, according to novelistAngus Wilson, is more than a piece of journalism;[100]it represents Dickens's vision of the society in which he lives. The same can be said of the episodes concerning prostitution and emigration, which illuminate the limits of Copperfield's moral universe and Dickens's own uncertainties.[101]That everything is put in order in Australia, that Martha marries a man from the bush, that Emily, in the strong arms of Dan Peggotty, becomes a lady of good works, that Micawber, who had been congenitally insolvent, suddenly acquires the management skills and becomes prosperous in dispensing justice. All these conversions are somewhat 'ironic',[102]and tend to undermine the hypothesis of 'a Dickens believing in the miracle of the antipodes', which Jane Rogers considers in her analysis of the 'fallen woman' as a plot device to gain the sympathy of Dickens's readers for Emily.[103]

John Forster, Dickens's early biographer, praises the bourgeois or middle-class values and ideology found inDavid Copperfield.[104]Like him the Victorian reading public shared Copperfield's complacent views, expressed with the assurance of success that is his, at the end, as a recognized writer who is happy in marriage and safe from need.

Gateth Cordery takes a close look at class consciousness. According to him, Copperfield's relationship with aristocrat Steerforth and the humble Uriah Heep is ""crucial"".[61]From the beginning, Copperfield ranks as and is considered by his friends among the good people. The Peggotty family, in Chapter 3, treat him with respect, ""as a visitor of distinction""; even at Murdstone and Grinby, his behaviour and clothes earned him the title of ""the little gentleman"". When he reached adulthood, he naturally enjoyed Steerforth's disdain for Ham as a simple ""joke about the poor"". So he is predisposed to succumb, by what he calls in chapter 7 an ""inborn power of attraction"", to the charm instinctively lent to beautiful people, about which David said ""a kind of enchantment ... to which it was a natural weakness to yield."" From start to finish, David remains fascinated by Steerforth, so he aspires inwardly to his social status.[105]

In parallel there is a contempt of the upstart, Heep, hatred of the same nature as Copperfield's senseless adoration for Steerforth, but inverted. That ""'umble"" Heep goes from a lowly clerk to an associate at Wickfield's, to claiming to win the hand of Agnes, daughter of his boss, is intolerable to David, though it is very similar to his own efforts to go from shorthand clerk to literary fame, with Dora Spenlow, the daughter of his employer.[106]Heep's innuendo that Copperfield is no better than him feeds on the disdain in which he holds Heep as of right: ""Copperfield, you've always been an upstart"",[107]an honesty of speech, comments Cordery, of which Copperfield himself is incapable.[106]

Another concern of Dickens is the institution of marriage and in particular, the unenviable place occupied by women. Whether at the home of Wickfield, Strong, or under the Peggotty boat, women are vulnerable to predators or intruders like Uriah Heep, Jack Maldon, James Steerforth; Murdstone's firmness prevails up to the death of two wives; with David and Dora complete incompetence reigns; and at the Micawber household, love and chaos go hand in hand; while Aunt Betsey is subjected to blackmail by her mysterious husband. Dickens, according to Gareth Cordery, clearly attacks the official status of marriage, which perpetuated an inequality between the sexes, an injustice that does not end with the separation of couples.[101]

The mid-Victorian era saw a change in gender roles for men and women, in part forced by the factories and separation of work and home, which made stereotypes of the woman at home and the man working away from home.[108]Values, like the imperative need for women to marry and to be that ideal described asThe Angel in the House(manages the home without aid and is always calm) are ""interrogated, tested and even subverted"",[109]for example by having one mother-figure be the character Betsey Trotwood, who is not a mother.[110]When seeming to describe a stereotypical image in particularly the female characters, the story ""does so in a way that reflects the fault-lines of the image.""[111]

Anne BrontëinThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall(1848) explores this iniquity in the status of the character Helen Graham, separated from her alcoholic husband. Dickens's understanding of the burden on women in marriage in this novel contrasts with his treatment of his own wifeCatherine, whom he expected to be an Angel in the House.[111]

Martha Endell and Emily Peggotty, the two friends in Yarmouth who work at the undertaker's house, reflect Dickens's commitment to ""save"" so-calledfallen women. Dickens was co-founder withAngela Burdett-CouttsofUrania Cottage, a home for young women who had ""turned to a life of immorality"", including theft and prostitution.[112]On the eve of her wedding to her cousin and fiancé, Ham, Emily abandons him for Steerforth. After Steerforth deserts her, she doesn't go back home, because she has disgraced herself and her family. Her uncle, Mr Peggotty, finds her in London on the brink of being forced into prostitution. So that she may have a fresh start away from her now degraded reputation, she and her uncle emigrate to Australia. Martha has been a prostitute and contemplated suicide but towards the end of the novel, she redeems herself by helping Daniel Peggotty find his niece after she returns to London. She goes with Emily to start a new life in Australia. There, she marries and lives happily.

Their emigration to Australia, in the wake of that of Micawber, Daniel Peggotty, and Mr Mell, emphasizes Dickens's belief that social and moral redemption can be achieved in a distant place, where someone may create a new and healthy life.[113]However, despite their families' forgiveness, they remain ""tainted"" and their expulsion from England is symbolic of their status: it is only at the other end of the world that these ""social outcasts"" can be reinstated. Morally, Dickens here conforms to the dominant middle-class opinion.

John O. Jordan devotes two pages to this woman, also ""lost"", though never having sinned.[114]The sanctification of the Victorian home, he says, depends on the opposition between twostereotypes, the ""angel"" and the ""whore"". Dickens denounced this restrictive dichotomy by portraying women ""in between"". Such is Rosa Dartle, passionate being, with the inextinguishable resentment of having been betrayed by Steerforth, a wound that is symbolised by the vibrant scar on her lip. Never does she allow herself to be assimilated by the dominant morality, refusing tooth and nail to put on the habit of the ideal woman. Avenger to the end, she wants the death of Little Emily, both the new conquest and victim of the same predator, and has only contempt for the efforts of David to minimize the scope of his words. As virtuous as anyone else, she claims, especially that Emily, she does not recognize any ideal family, each being moulded in the manner of its social class, nor any affiliation as a woman: she is Rosa Dartle, in herself.[115]

David's vision, on the other hand, is marked by class consciousness: for him, Rosa, emaciated and ardent at the same time, as if there were incompatibility (chapter 20), is a being apart, half human, half animal, like the lynx, with its inquisitive forehead, always on the look out (chapter 29), which consumes an inner fire reflected in the gaunt eyes of the dead of which only this flame remains (chapter 20). In reality, says Jordan, it is impossible for David to understand or even imagine any sexual tension, especially that which governs the relationship between Rosa and Steerforth, which, in a way, reassures his own innocence and protects what he calls his ""candour"" – frankness orangelism? – his story. Also, Rosa Dartle's irreducible and angry marginality represents a mysterious threat to his comfortable and reassuring domestic ideology.[116]

Dickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various literary genres, including thepicaresque noveltradition,[117]melodrama,[118]and thenovel of sensibility.[119]Satireandironyare central to the picaresque novel.[120]Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition ofLaurence Sterne,Henry Fielding, andTobias Smollett. Fielding'sTom Jones[121][122]was a major influence on the nineteenth century novel including Dickens, who read it in his youth,[123]and named a sonHenry Fielding Dickensin his honour.[124][125]Melodrama is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions.

Trevor Blount comments on the fascination that Dickens has always exercised on the public. He mentions the lavishness, energy, vividness, brilliance, and tenderness of Dickens's writing, along with the range of his imagination. Blount also refers to Dickens's humour, and his use of the macabre and of pathos. Finally, Blount celebrates the artistic mastery of an overflowing spontaneity, which is conveyed with both delicacy and subtlety.[126]What Blount admires, in the first place, is the vigour with which the characters ""rise"" from the page and create a ""phantasmagorical"" universe, which is seen by the reader with the intensity of an hallucination. This is best illustrated in many of Dickens's works, by the powerful figure of a weak individual. InDavid CopperfieldMr Wilkins Micawber is such a figure, someone who is formidably incompetent, grandiose in his irreducible optimism, sumptuous in his verbal virtuosity, and whose grandiloquent tenderness is irresistibly comical.[127]Micawber has been described as ""With the one exception ofFalstaff, ... the greatest comic figure in English literature"".[128]

In this novel, one characteristic noted by Edgar Johnson is that Dickens, in the first part, ""makes the reader see with the eyes of a child"",[129]an innovative technique for the time, first tried inDombey and Sonwith an omniscientnarrator, and carried here to perfection through the use of the 'I'.

ModernistnovelistVirginia Woolfwrites, that when we read Dickens ""we remodel our psychological geography ... [as he produces] characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks"".[130]

The very principle of satire is to question, and to tear off the masks, so as to reveal the raw reality under the varnish.[131]Dickens uses the whole arsenal of literary tools that are available to the satirist, or rather supplied by his narrator, David, who even directs satire upon himself. These tools includeirony,humour, andcaricature. How it is employed relates to the characters' differing personalities. Satire is thus gentler towards some characters than others; toward David the hero-narrator, it is at once indulgent and transparent.

There are several different types of character: On the one hand, there are the good ones, Peggotty, Dr Strong, Traddles, Agnes etc., on the other hand, there are the bad ones, Murdstone, Steerforth, Uriah Heep, etc. A third category are characters who change over time, including Betsey Trotwood, who at first is more obstinate than nasty, it is true, and Martha Endell, and Creakle, etc. There is also a contrast drawn between ever-frozen personalities such as Micawber, Dora, Rosa Dartle, and those who evolve. The latter includes David, Mr Mell, Miss Mowcher. There is also a contrast drawn between the idiosyncrasies of Mr Dick, Barkis, Mrs Gummidge, and the subtle metamorphosis from innocence to maturity of characters like David, Traddles, Agnes.

Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an ""allegorical impetus"" to a novel's meanings.[132]The name Mr Murdstone inDavid Copperfieldconjures up twin allusions to ""murder"" and stony coldness;[133]Strong is definitely not ""strong""; Creakle ""squeaks and grinds"". There can also be a visual dimension to Dickens's humour. This includes Micawber's rotundity, his wife's dried-up body, which forever offers a sterile breast, Betsey's steadfast stiffness, Mr Sharp's bowed head, Daniel Peggotty's stubborn rudeness, Clara Copperfield's delicate silhouette, and Dora's mischievous air. Then there are exaggerated attitudes that are constantly repeated. Dickens creates humour out of character traits, such as Mr Dick's kite flying, James Steerforth's insistent charm, Uriah Heep's obsequiousness, Betsey pounding David's room. There are in addition the employment of repetitive verbal phrases: ""umble"" of the same Heep, the ""willin"" of Barkis, the ""lone lorn creetur"" of Mrs Gummidge. Dickens also uses objects for a humorous purpose, like Traddles's skeletons, the secret box of Barkis, the image of Heep as a snake, and the metallic rigidity of Murdstone.

InDavid Copperfieldidealised characters and highly sentimental scenes are contrasted with caricatures and ugly social truths. While good characters are also satirised, a considered sentimentality replaces satirical ferocity. This is a characteristic of all of Dickens's writing, but it is reinforced inDavid Copperfieldby the fact that these people are the narrator's close family members and friends, who are devoted to David and sacrificing themselves for his happiness. Hence the indulgence applied from the outset, with humour prevailing along with loving complicity. David is the first to receive such treatment, especially in the section devoted to his early childhood, when he is lost in the depths of loneliness in London, following his punishment by Mr Murdstone. Michael Hollington analyses a scene in chapter 11 that seems emblematic of the situation and how humour and sentimentality are employed by Dickens.[134]This is the episode where the very young David orders a pitcher of the best beer in apublic house, ""To moisten what I had for dinner"".[135]David's memory has retained the image of the scene, which is so vivid that he sees himself as from the outside. He has forgotten the exact date (his birthday). This episode release David's emotional pain, writes Michael Hollington, obliterating the infected part of the wound. Beyond the admiration aroused for the amazing self-confidence of the little child, in resolving this issue and taking control of his life with the assurance of someone much older, the passage ""testifies to the work of memory, transfiguring the moment into a true myth"".[134]The tone is nostalgic because, ultimately, the epilogue is a true moment of grace. The wife of the keeper, returning David's money, deposits on his forehead a gift that has become extremely rare,[136]a kiss, ""Half admired and half compassionate"", but above all full of kindness and femininity; at least, adds David, as a tender and precious reminder, ""I am sure"".

Dickens went to the theatre regularly from an early age and even considered becoming an actor in 1832.[137]""Many of the plays that he saw on the London stage in the 1820s and 1830s weremelodramas"".[138]There is a visual, theatrical—even cinematic—element in some scenes inDavid Copperfield. The cry of Martha at the edge of the river belongs to the purest Victorian melodrama, as does the confrontation between Mr Peggotty and Mrs Steerforth, in chapter 32:

Such language, according to Trevor Blount, is meant to be said aloud. Many other scenes employ the same method: Micawber crossing the threshold, Heep harassing David in Chapter 17, the chilling apparition of Littimer in the middle of David's party in Chapter 27. The climax of this splendid series of scenes is the storm off Yarmouth, which is an epilogue to the menacing references to the sea previously, which shows Dicken's most intense virtuosity (chapter 55).

Dickens made the following comment in 1858: ""Every good actor plays direct to every good author, and every writer of fiction, though he may not adopt the dramatic form, writes in effect for the stage"".[140]

Setting is a major aspect of Dickens's ""narrative artistry and of his methods of characterization"", so that ""the most memorable quality of his novels may well be their atmospheric density [... of the] descriptive writing"".[141]

InDavid Copperfieldsetting is less urban, more rustic than in other novels, and especially maritime. Besides Peggotty, who is a seaman whose home is an overturned hull, Mr Micawber goes to the naval port ofPlymouthon the south coast after prison and appears finally on board a steamer. David himself is connected toYarmouth, and Aunt Betsey settled in theChannelport ofDover. Young David notices the sea on his first day at her home; ""the air from the sea came blowing in again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers"".[142]The city,London, is especially the place of misfortune, where the dark warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby are found. The philosopherAlain(pseudonym of Émile-Auguste Chartier) comments as follows about Dickens's portrayal of London (but it might also be applied to other locations), as cited by Lançon:

Important symbols include, imprisonment, the sea, flowers, animals, dreams, and Mr Dick's kite.[144]According to Henri Suhamy, ""Dickens's symbolism consists in giving significance to physical details ... The constant repetition of these details ... contributes to deepen their emblematic significance"".[145]This may include the characters, aspects of the story, and, more prominently amongst the motifs, places or objects.

Separating realism and symbolism can be tricky, especially, for example, when it relates, to the subject of imprisonment, which is both a very real place of confinement for the Micawber family, and, more generally throughoutDavid Copperfield, symbolic of the damage inflicted on a sick society, trapped in its inability to adapt or compromise, with many individuals walled within in themselves.[146]

The imponderable power of the sea is almost always associated with death: it took Emily's father; will take Ham and Steerforth, and in general is tied to David's ""unrest"" associated with his Yarmouth experiences.[147]In the end nothing remains but Steerforth's body cast-up as ""flotsam and jetsam"", that symbolises the moral emptiness of David's adoration. The violent storm in Yarmouth coincides with the moment when the conflicts reached a critical threshold, when it is as if angry Nature called for a final resolution; as Kearney noted, ""The rest of the novel is something of an anti-climax after the storm chapter.""[147][148]Referring to the climactic storm scene inDavid Copperfield, the last in any Dickens novel, Kearney remarked that ""The symbolism of sea, sky and storm is successfully integrated to achieve what amounts to a mystical dimension in the novel, and this mystical dimension is, on the whole, more acceptable than the ones found elsewhere in Dickens"".[149]

According to Daniel L Plung, four types of animal are a particularly important aspect of the way symbolism is used: song birds symbolise innocence; ""lions and raptors [are] associated with the fallen but not evil""; dogs, other than Jip, are associated ""with the malicious and self-interested""; while snakes and eel represent evil.[150]A typical example of the way that animal symbolism is used is found in the following sentence: "" 'the influence of the Murdstones upon me [David] was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird"" '.[151]When David describes Steerforth as ""brave as a lion"" this is a clue to Steerforth's moral weakness and foreshadows subsequent events.[152]

Flowers symbolise innocence, for example, David is called ""Daisy"" by Steerforth, because he is naive and pure, while Dora constantly paints bouquets, and when Heep was removed from Wickfield House, flowers return to the living room. Mr Dick's kite, represents how much he is both outside and above society, immune to its hierarchical social system. Furthermore, it flies among the innocent birds,[153]and just as this toy soothes and gives joy to him, Mr Dick heals the wounds and restore peace where the others without exception have failed.

Dreams are also an important part of the novel's underlying symbolic structure, and are ""used as a transitional device to bind [its] parts together"" with twelve chapters ending ""with a dream or reverie"".[154]In the early dark period of David's life his dreams ""are invariably ugly"", but in later chapters they are more mixed, with some reflecting ""fanciful hopes"" that are never realised, while others are nightmares which foreshadow ""actual problems"".[154]

In addition physical beauty, in the form of Clara, is emblematic of moral good, while the ugliness of Uriah Heep, Mr Creakle and Mr Murdstone underlines their villainy. While David, the story's hero, has benefited from her love and suffered from the violence of the others.

Dickens, in preparation for this novel, went toNorwich,Lowestoft, andYarmouthwhere the Peggotty family resides, but he stayed there for only five hours, on 9 January 1849. He assured his friends, that his descriptions were based on his own memories, brief as were his local experiences. However, looking to the work of K. J. Fielding[155]reveals that the dialect of this town was taken from a book written by a local author, Major Edward Moor published in 1823.[156]There, Dickens founda beein(a house),fisherate(officiate),dodman(snail),clickesen(gossip), andwinnicking(tears) fromwinnick(to cry) and so on.[157]

Many view this novel as Dickens'smasterpiece, beginning with his friend and first biographer John Forster, who writes: ""Dickens never stood so high in reputation as at the completion of Copperfield"",[158]and the author himself calls it ""his favourite child"".[159][N 10]It is true, he says, that ""underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life"",[160]that is, an experience of self-writing. It is therefore not surprising that the book is often placed in the category of autobiographical works. From a strictly literary point of view, however, it goes beyond this framework in the richness of its themes and the originality of its writing.

Situated in the middle of Dickens's career, it represents, according to Paul Davis, a turning point in his work, the point of separation between the novels of youth and those of maturity.[161]In 1850, Dickens was 38 years old and had twenty more to live, which he filled with other masterpieces, often denser, sometimes darker, that addressed most of the political, social and personal issues he faced.

Dickens welcomed the publication of his work with intense emotion, and he continued to experience this until the end of his life. When he went through a period of personal difficulty and frustration in the 1850s, he returned toDavid Copperfieldas to a dear friend who resembled him: ""Why,"" he wrote to Forster, ""Why is it, as with poor David, a sense comes always crashing on me now, when I fall into low spirits, as of one happiness I have missed in life, and one friend and companion I have never made?""[162][N 11]When Dickens begins writingGreat Expectations, which was also written in the first person, he rereadDavid Copperfieldand confided his feelings to Forster: ""was affected by it to a degree you would hardly believe"".[163]Criticism has not always been even-handed, though over time the high importance of this novel has been recognised.

Although Dickens became a Victorian celebrity his readership was mainly the middle classes, including the so-called skilled workers, according to the French critic Fabrice Bensimon, because ordinary people could not afford it.[164]Issues I to V of the serial version reached 25,000 copies in two years, modest sales compared to 32,000Dombey and Sonand 35,000Bleak House, but Dickens was nevertheless happy: ""Everyone is cheering David on"", he writes to Mrs Watson,[165]and, according to Forster, his reputation was at the top.[158]

The first reviews were mixed,[166]but the great contemporaries of Dickens showed their approval:Thackerayfound the novel ""freshly and simply simple"";[167]John Ruskin, in hisModern Painters, was of the opinion that the scene of the storm surpasses Turner's evocations of the sea; more soberly,Matthew Arnolddeclared it ""rich in merits"";[28]and, in his autobiographical bookA Small Boy and Others,Henry Jamesevokes the memory of ""treasure so hoarded in the dusty chamber of youth"".[168]

After Dickens's death,David Copperfieldrose to the forefront of the writer's works, both through sales, for example, inHousehold Wordsin 1872 where sales reached 83,000,[169]and the praise of critics. In 1871, Scottish novelist and poetMargaret Oliphantdescribed it as ""the culmination of Dickens's early comic fiction"";[170]However, in the late nineteenth-century Dickens's critical reputation suffered a decline, though he continued to have many readers. This began whenHenry Jamesin 1865 ""relegated Dickens to the second division of literature on the grounds that he could not 'see beneath the surface of things'"". Then in 1872, two years after Dickens's death,George Henry Leweswondered how to ""reconcile [Dickens's] immense popularity with the 'critical contempt' which he attracted"".[171]However, Dickens was defended by the novelistGeorge Gissingin 1898 inCharles Dickens: A Critical Study.[171]G. K. Chesterton published an important defence of Dickens in his bookCharles Dickensin 1906, where he describes him as this ""most English of our great writers"".[172]Dickens's literary reputation grew in the 1940s and 1950s because of essays byGeorge OrwellandEdmund Wilson(both published in 1940), and Humphrey House'sThe Dickens World(1941).[173]However, in 1948,F. R. LeavisinThe Great Tradition, contentiously, excluded Dickens from his canon, characterising him as a ""popular entertainer""[174]without ""mature standards and interests"".[175]

Dickens's reputation, however, continued to grow and K. J. Fielding (1965) and Geoffrey Thurley (1976) identify what they callDavid Copperfield's ""centrality"", andQ. D. Leavisin 1970, looked at the images he draws of marriage, of women, and of moral simplicity.[176]In their 1970 publicationDickens the Novelist, F. R. and Q. D. Leavis called Dickens ""one of the greatest of creative writers"", and F. R. Leavis had changed his mind about Dickens since his 1948 work, no longer finding the popularity of the novels with readers as a barrier to their seriousness or profundity.[177]In 1968 Sylvère Monod, after having finely analyzed the structure and style of the novel, describe it as ""the triumph of the art of Dickens"",[6]which analysis was shared by Paul B. Davis.[7]The central themes are explored by Richard Dunne in 1981, including the autobiographical dimension, the narrator-hero characterization process, memory and forgetting, and finally the privileged status of the novel in theinterconnection between similar works of Dickens.[176]Q. D. Leavis comparesCopperfieldtoTolstoy'sWar and Peaceand looks at adult-child relationships in both novels. According to writer Paul B. Davis, Q. D. Leavis excels at dissecting David's relationship with Dora.[7]Gwendolyn Needham in an essay, published in 1954, analyzes the novel as abildungsroman, as did Jerome H. Buckley twenty years later.[7]In 1987Alexander Welshdevoted several chapters to show thatCopperfieldis the culmination of Dickens's autobiographical attempts to explore himself as a novelist in the middle of his career. Finally,J. B. Priestleywas particularly interested in Mr Micawber and concludes that ""With the one exception ofFalstaff, he is the greatest comic figure in English literature"".[128]

In 2015, theBBCCulture section polled book critics outside the UK about novels by British authors; they rankedDavid Copperfieldeighth on the list of the 100 Greatest British Novels.[178]The characters and their varied places in society in the novel evoked reviewer comments, for example, the novel is ""populated by some of the most vivid characters ever created,""  ""David himself, Steerforth, Peggotty, Mr Dick – and it climbs up and down and off the class ladder."", remarked by criticMaureen Corriganand echoed byWendy Lesser.[179]

David Copperfieldhas pleased many writers.Charlotte Brontë, for example, commented in 1849 in a letter to the reader of her publisher: ""I have readDavid Copperfield; it seems to me very good—admirable in some parts. You said it had affinity toJane Eyre: it has—now and then—only what an advantage has Dickens in his varied knowledge of men and things!""[180]Tolstoy, for his part, considered it ""the best work of the best English novelist"" and, according toF. R. Leavisand Q. D. Leavis, was inspired by David and Dora's love story to have Prince Andrew marry Princess Lise inWar and Peace.[181]Henry Jamesremembered being moved to tears, while listening to the novel, hidden under a table, read aloud in the family circle.[182]Dostoevskyenthusiastically cultivated the novel in a prison camp in Siberia.[183]Franz Kafkawrote in his diary in 1917, that the first chapter of his novelAmerikawas inspired byDavid Copperfield.[184][185][186][N 12]James Joyceparodied it inUlysses.[187]Virginia Woolf, who was not very fond of Dickens, states thatDavid Copperfield, along withRobinson Crusoe, Grimm's fairy tales,Scott'sWaverleyandPickwick's Posthumous Papers, ""are not books, but stories communicated by word of mouth in those tender years when fact and fiction merge, and thus belong to the memories and myths of life, and not to its aesthetic experience.""[188]Woolf also noted in a letter to Hugh Walpole in 1936, that she is re-reading it for the sixth time: ""I'd forgotten how magnificent it is.""[189]It also seems that the novel wasSigmund Freud's favourite;[190][191]andSomerset Maughamsees it as a ""great"" work, although his hero seems to him rather weak, unworthy even of its author, while Mr Micawber never disappoints: ""The most remarkable of them is, of course, Mr Micawber. He never fails you.""[192]

As is the custom for a regular serialised publication for a wide audience,David Copperfield, like Dickens's earlier novels, was from the beginning a ""story in pictures"" whose many engravings are part of the novel and how the story is related.

Phizdrew the original, the first two illustrations associated withDavid Copperfield: on the wrapper for the serial publication, for which he engraved the silhouette of a baby staring at a globe, probably referring to the working title (The Copperfield Survey of the World as it Rolled), and the frontispiece (later used in the published books), and the title page. The green wrapper is shown at the top of this article. Phiz drew the images around the central baby-over-the-globe with no information on the characters who would appear in the novel. He knew only that it would be a bildungsroman.[193]The images begin at the bottom, on the left side of the tree that has leaves on the left, and is dead on the right. A woman holds a baby on her lap. The images continue clockwise, marking events of a life, but with no reference to any specific event or specific character of the novel.[193][194]

When each issue was written, Phiz then worked with Dickens on the illustrations. ""In the monthly plates, Phiz would have to translate the memories of the protagonist-narrator into a third-person objective or dramatic point of view.""[193]Some of his illustrations contain details that are not in the text, but illuminate a character or situation, ""forming part of [...] of what the novel is"".[195]Dickens accepted and even encouraged these additional, sometimes subtle indications, which, commenting on the event, say more than the narrator says in print. The latter intends to stay behind, just like the author who, thus, hides behind the illustrator.

Dickens was particularly scrupulous about illustrations; he scrutinised the smallest details and sometimes demanded modifications, for example to replace for a very particular episode the coat that David wears by ""a little jacket"".[196]The illustration of the meeting between David and Aunt Betsey was particularly delicate, and Phiz had to do it several times, the ultimate choice being that of Dickens.[19]Once the desired result was obtained, Dickens does not hide his satisfaction: the illustrations are ""capital"", he writes to Phiz, and especially that which depicts Mr Micawber in chapter 16, ""uncommonly characteristic"".[197]

One puzzling mismatch between the text and accompanying illustrations is that of the Peggotty family's boat-house ""cottage"" on the Yarmouth sands (pictured). It is clear from the text that the author envisaged the house as an upright boat, whereas the illustrator depicted it as an upturned hull resting on the beach with holes cut for the doors and windows. Interior illustrations of the cottage also show it as a room with curved ceiling beams implying an upturned hull. Although Dickens seemed to have had the opportunity to correct this discrepancy he never did, suggesting that he was happy with the illustrator's depiction.[198]

David Copperfieldwas later illustrated by many artists later, after the serialization, including:

Some of these works are fullsize paintings rather than illustrations included in editions of the novels.[201]Kyd painted watercolours. Frank Reynolds provided the illustrations for a 1911 edition of David Copperfield.[202]

Although the reputation of Dickens with literary critics went through a decline and a much later rise after he died,[203]his popularity with readers followed a different pattern after his death. Around 1900, his novels, includingDavid Copperfield, began an increase in popularity, and the 40-year copyrights expired for all but his latest novels, opening the door to other publishers in the UK; by 1910 all of them had expired.[204]This created the opportunity for new illustrators in new editions of the novels, as both Fred Barnard (Household Edition) and Frank Reynolds (1911 edition ofDavid Copperfield) provided, for example; their styles were different from that ofPhizwho provided the illustrations for the first publications of the novel in 1850 and during the author's life. As the books were read by so many (one publisher, Chapman & Hall, sold 2 million copies of Dickens's works in the period 1900–1906),[204]the characters became more popular for use outside the novels, in jigsaw puzzles and postcards. Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber were popular figures for illustrations. AsWorld War Iapproached, the illustrations on postcards and the novels, abridged or full length, continued in popularity in the UK and among the soldiers and sailors abroad.[204]

LikeDombey and Son,David Copperfieldwas not the subject of a specific contract; it followed the agreement of 1 June 1844, which was still valid. In that contract, the publishing houseBradbury and Evansreceived a quarter of the receipts from what Dickens wrote for the next eight years. This did not prevent the novelist from criticizing his publisher, or providing an incomplete number, just ""to see exactly where I am"" and for his illustratorPhizto have ""some material to work on"".[205]

The 1850 book, published by Bradbury and Evans, was dedicated to the honourable Mr and Mrs Richard Watson, fromRockingham, Northamptonshire, aristocratic friends met on a trip to Switzerland five years ago.[206]A brief preface was written in 1850 by the author, already entrusted to Forster after he finished his manuscript, with the promise that a new work will follow. This text was also used for the 1859 edition, the Cheap Edition. The ultimate version of 1867, also called the Charles Dickens edition, included another preface by the author with the statement thatDavid Copperfieldis the favourite work of the author.

Three volumes were published byTauchnitzin 1849–50, in English, for distribution outside Great Britain in Europe. During Dickens's lifetime, many other editions were released, and many since he died. According to Paul Schlicke, the most reliable edition is the 1981 edition fromClarendon Presswith an introduction and notes by Nina Burgis; it serves as a reference for later editions, including those ofCollins,Penguin Booksand Wordsworth Classics.[10]

While it was being published,David Copperfieldwas the object, according to Philip Bolton's survey, of six initial dramatisations, followed by a further twenty when the public's interest was at its peak in the 1850s.[207]The first adaptation,Born with a CaulbyGeorge Almar, was staged while the serial issues were not yet completed, with some changes from Dickens's plot, having Steerforth live and marry Emily, and inventing a character to kill Mr Murdstone.[208]The most spectacular dramatisation, however, were those of Dickens himself. Although he waited more than ten years to prepare a version for his public readings, it soon became one of his favourite performances, especially the storm scene, which he kept for the finale, ""the most sublime moment in all the readings"".[209]

David Copperfieldhas been filmed on several occasions:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164,Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas,"In 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterioussea monster, which is speculated to be a giganticnarwhal. The U.S. government assembles an expedition inNew York Cityto find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a Frenchmarine biologistand the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition.Canadianwhalerand masterharpoonerNed Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.

The expedition leaves Brooklyn aboard theUnited States NavyfrigateAbraham Lincoln, then travels south aroundCape Horninto thePacific Ocean. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. Aronnax and Land are hurled into the sea, and Conseil jumps into the water after them. They survive by climbing onto the ""monster"", which, they are startled to find, is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they are captured and introduced to the submarine's mysterious constructor and commander,Captain Nemo.

The rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard theNautilus, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation — a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to escape terrestrialcivilization. Nemo explains that his submarine iselectrically poweredand can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he cannot let them leave — they must remain on board permanently.

They visit many oceanic regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers viewcoralformations, sunken vessels from theBattle of Vigo Bay, theAntarcticice barrier, thetransatlantic telegraph cable, and the legendary underwater realm ofAtlantis. They even travel to the South Pole and are trapped in an upheaval of an iceberg on the way back, caught in a narrow gallery of ice from which they are forced to dig themselves out. The passengers also put ondiving suits, huntsharksand other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by theNautilus. When the submarine returns to theAtlantic Ocean, a school ofgiant squid(""devilfish"") attacks the vessel and kills another crewman.

The novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, theNautilusis attacked by awarshipfrom the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo — whom Aronnax dubs an ""archangel of hatred"" — rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression.

Circumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, he announces that they are in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him, yet he is still drawn to the man. Fearing that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, he avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, ""O almighty God! Enough! Enough!"". Aronnax immediately joins his companions as they carry out their escape plans, but as they board the submarine's skiff they realize that theNautilushas seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, theMoskenstraumen(more commonly known as the ""Maelstrom""). They escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate remained unknown until the events ofThe Mysterious Island.

Captain Nemo's assumed name recallsHomer'sOdyssey, whenOdysseusencounters the monstrousCyclopsPolyphemusin the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it isOutis(Οὖτις) 'no one', translated intoLatinas ""Nemo"". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for ten years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.

The novel repeatedly mentions the U.S. Naval CommanderMatthew Fontaine Maury, an oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.

The novel alludes to other Frenchmen, includingLapérouse, the celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation;Dumont d'Urville, a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lapérouse's ships; andFerdinand de Lesseps, builder of theSuez Canaland nephew of the sole survivor of Lapérouse's ill-fated expedition. TheNautilusfollows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lapérouse's vessels disappeared; she entersTorres Straitand becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, theAstrolabe; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

In possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-described battle with a school ofgiant squid, one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: ""To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author ofThe Toilers of the Sea."" A bestselling novel in Verne's day,The Toilers of the Seaalso features a threateningcephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by critics to be symbolic of theIndustrial Revolution. Certainly, Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in theRevolutions of 1848.

Other symbols and themes pique modern critics.Margaret Drabble, for instance, argues that Verne's masterwork also anticipated theecology movementand influenced Frenchavant-gardeimagery.[8]As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during theCretan Revolt of 1866–1869, proving to Professor Aronnax that he had not severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues anIndianpearl diverfrom a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. When asked why he would help a ""representative of that race from which he'd fled under the seas"", Nemo responds that the diver, as an ""East Indian"", ""lives in the land of the oppressed"".[9]

Indeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the book's final form, Nemo says to professor Aronnax, ""That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!""[10]In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was aPolish nobleman, whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the PolishJanuary Uprisingof 1863. These specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisherPierre-Jules Hetzel, believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of theRussian Empire, hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy war, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins.

Even so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under a Polish hero,Tadeusz Kościuszko, leader of theuprising against Russian and Prussian control in 1794;[11]Kościuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation ""Finis Poloniae!"" (""Polandis no more!"").

Five years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel,The Mysterious Island. The novel changes the captain's nationality from Polish to Indian; in the book's final chapters, Nemo reveals that he is an Indian prince named Dakkar who was a descendant ofTipu Sultan, a prominent ruler of theKingdom of Mysore, and participated in theIndian Rebellion of 1857, an ultimately unsuccessful uprising againstCompany rule in India. After the rebellion, which led to the death of his family, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages.

Verne took the name ""Nautilus"" from one of theearliest successful submarines, built in 1800 byRobert Fulton, who also invented the first commercially successfulsteamboat. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chamberednautilus. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developedFrench NavysubmarinePlongeurat the 1867Exposition Universelle, which guided him in his development of the novel'sNautilus.[4]

The diving gear used by passengers on theNautilusis presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) thesurface-supplied[12]hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatusdesigned by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865. Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demandregulator.[12][13][14]The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called anaérophore(Greek for ""air-carrier""). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, but Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: ""TheNautilus's pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.""

The novel was first translated into English in 1872 by ReverendLewis Page Mercier. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the Frenchscaphandre— properly ""diving suit"" — as ""cork-jacket"", following a long-obsolete usage as ""a type oflifejacket""). Some of these distortions may have been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally includingDaniel O'Connell[15]among other international figures. Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later retranslations continued to recycle its mistakes, including mistranslating the title as ""...under the Sea"", rather than ""...under the Seas"".

In 1962, Anthony Bonner published a translation of the novel withBantam Classics. This edition included an introduction byRay Bradbury, comparing Captain Nemo toCaptain AhabofMoby-Dick.[16]

A significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.[17]Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text. In 1976, Miller published ""The Annotated Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea""[18]at the suggestion of theThomas Y. Crowel Companyeditorial staff.[19]The cover declared it ""The only completely restored and annotated edition"". In 1993, Miller collaborated with his fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter to produce ""The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition"", published in 1993 by theNaval Institute Press.[20]Its text took advantage of Walter's unpublished translation, whichProject Gutenberglater made available online.

In 1998, William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, published byOxford University Press(ISBN978-0-19-953927-7). Butcher includes detailed notes, a comprehensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by Hetzel, his publisher.

In 2010, Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation,20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations titledAmazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classicsand published byState University of New York Press(ISBN978-1-4384-3238-0).

In 2017, David Coward issued a new translation published byPenguin Classics(ISBN9780141394930) with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, including a new introduction, notes, and a note on the text, using the 1871 Christian Chelebourg edition of the text as the basis for his translation. Coward also included 42 illustrations, which were published for the first time in the 'Collection Hetzel' in 1901.

The science fiction writerTheodore L. Thomascriticized the novel in 1961, claiming that ""there is not a single bit of valid speculation"" in the book and that ""none of its predictions has come true"". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and theNautilusas ""pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time."" The notes to the 1993 translation point out that the errors Thomas notes were in Mercier's translation, not the original.

Despite his criticisms, Thomas conceded: ""Put them all together with the magic of Verne's story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it"".[13]

In 2023, Malaurie Guillaume presented Nemo as the firsteco-terroristor first figure of ecologic radicality.[21]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215,The call of the wild,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild,"The story opens in 1897 with Buck, a powerful 140-poundSt. Bernard–Scotch Shepherdmix,[1][2]happily living inCalifornia'sSanta Clara Valleyas the pampered pet of Judge Miller and his family. One night, assistant gardener Manuel, needing money to pay off gambling debts, steals Buck and sells him to a stranger. Buck is shipped toSeattle, where he is 
confined in a crate, starved, and ill-treated. When released, Buck attacks his handler, the ""man in the red sweater"" who teaches Buck the ""law of club and fang"", sufficiently cowing him. The man shows some kindness after Buck demonstrates obedience.

Shortly after, Buck is sold to twoFrench-Canadiandispatchers from the Canadian government, François and Perrault, who take him toAlaska. Buck is trained as asled dogfor theKlondike regionof Canada. In addition to Buck, François and Perrault have ten dogs on their team. Buck's teammates teach him how to survive cold winter nights and about pack society. Over the next several weeks on the trail, a bitter rivalry develops between Buck and the lead dog, Spitz, a vicious and quarrelsome whitehusky. Buck eventually kills Spitz in a fight and becomes the new lead dog.

When François and Perrault complete the round-trip of theYukon Trailin record time, returning toSkagwaywith their dispatches, they are given new orders from the Canadian government. They sell their sled team to a ""Scotch half-breed"" man, who works in the mail service. The dogs must make long, tiring trips, carrying heavy loads to the mining areas. While running the trail, Buck seems to have memories of a canine ancestor who has a short-legged hairy man as a companion. Meanwhile, the weary animals become weak from the hard labor, and the wheel dog, Dave, a morose husky, becomesterminally sickand is eventuallyshot.

With the dogs too exhausted and footsore to be of use, the mail carrier sells them to threestampedersfrom the American Southland (the present-daycontiguous United States)—a vain woman named Mercedes, her sheepish husband Charles, and her arrogant brother Hal. They lack survival skills for the Northern wilderness, struggle to control the sled, and ignore others' helpful advice—particularly warnings about the dangerous spring melt. When told her sled is too heavy, Mercedes dumps out crucial supplies in favor of fashion objects. She and Hal foolishly create a team of 14 dogs, believing they will travel faster. The dogs are overfed and overworked, then starved when food runs low. Most of the dogs die on the trail, leaving only Buck and four other dogs when they pull into theWhite River.

The group meets John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs' poor condition. The trio ignores Thornton's warnings about crossing the ice and press onward. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses to continue. After Hal whips Buck mercilessly, Thornton hits him and cuts Buck free. The group presses onward with the four remaining dogs, but their weight causes the ice to break and the dogs and humans (along with their sled) to fall into the river and drown.

As Thornton nurses Buck back to health, Buck grows to love him. Buck fends off a malicious man named Burton who hit Thornton while the latter was defending an innocent ""tenderfoot."" This gives Buck a reputation all over the North. Buck also saves Thornton when he falls into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips topan for gold, a man called Matthewson wagers Thornton on Buck's strength and devotion. Buck pulls a sled with a half-ton (1,000 lb; 450 kg) load of flour, breaking it free from the frozen ground, dragging it 100 yards (91 m), and winning Thornton US$1,600 (equivalent to $60,000 in 2024).

Using his winnings, Thornton pays his debts and continues searching for gold with partners Pete and Hans, sledding Buck and six other dogs to search for a fabled Lost Cabin. Once they locate a suitable gold find, the dogs find they have nothing to do. Buck has more ancestor memories of being with the primitive ""hairy man.""[3]While Thornton and his two friends pan gold, Buck hears the call of the wild, explores the wilderness, and socializes with a wolf from a local pack. However, Buck does not join the wolves and returns to Thornton. Buck repeatedly goes back and forth between Thornton and the wild, unsure of where he belongs. Returning to the campsite one day, he finds Hans, Pete, and Thornton along with their dogs have been murdered byNative AmericanYeehats. Enraged, Buck kills several Natives to avenge Thornton, then realizes he no longer has any human ties left. He goes looking for his wild brother and encounters a hostile wolf pack. He fights them and wins, then discovers that the lone wolf he had socialized with is a pack member. Buck follows the pack into the forest and answers the call of the wild.

The legend of Buck spreads among other Native Americans as the ""Ghost Dog"" of the Northland (Alaska and northwestern Canada). Each year, on the anniversary of his attack on the Yeehats, Buck returns to the former campsite where he was last with Thornton to mourn his death. Every winter, leading the wolf pack, Buck wreaks vengeance on the Yeehats ""as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.""

California nativeJack Londonhad traveled around the United States as ahobo, returned to California to finish high school (he dropped out at age 14), and spent a year in college atBerkeley, when in 1897 he went to the Klondike by way of Alaska during the height of theKlondike Gold Rush. Later, he said of the experience: ""It was in the Klondike I found myself.""[4]

He left California in July and traveled by boat toDyea, Alaska, where he landed and went inland. To reach the goldfields, he and his party transported their gear over theChilkoot Pass, often carrying loads as heavy as 100 pounds (45 kg) on their backs. They were successful in staking claims to eight gold mines along theStewart River.[5]

London stayed in the Klondike for almost a year, living temporarily in the frontier town ofDawson City, before moving to a nearby winter camp, where he spent the winter in a temporary shelter reading books he had brought:Charles Darwin'sOn the Origin of SpeciesandJohn Milton'sParadise Lost.[6]In the winter of 1898, Dawson City was a city comprising about 30,000 miners, a saloon, an opera house, and a street of brothels.[7]

In the spring, as the annual gold stampeders began to stream in, London left. He had contractedscurvy, common in the Arctic winters where fresh produce was unavailable. When his gums began to swell he decided to return to California. With his companions, he rafted 2,000 miles (3,200 km) down theYukon River, through portions of the wildest territory in the region, until they reachedSt. Michael. There, he hired himself out on a boat to earn return passage toSan Francisco.[8]

In Alaska, London found the material that inspired him to writeThe Call of the Wild.[4]Dyea Beach was the primary point of arrival for miners when London traveled through there, but because its access was treacherousSkagwaysoon became the new arrival point for prospectors.[9]To reach the Klondike, miners had to navigateWhite Pass, known as ""Dead Horse Pass"", where horse carcasses littered the route because they could not survive the harsh and steep ascent. Horses were replaced with dogs as pack animals to transport material over the pass;[10]particularly strong dogs with thick fur were ""much desired, scarce and high in price"".[11]

London would have seen many dogs, especially prizedhuskysled dogs, in Dawson City and the winter camps situated close to the main sled route. He was friends withMarshall Latham Bondand his brother Louis Whitford Bond, the owners of a mixedSt. Bernard-Scotch Colliedog about which London later wrote: ""Yes, Buck is based on your dog at Dawson.""[12]Beinecke LibraryatYale Universityholds a photograph of Bond's dog, taken during London's stay in the Klondike in 1897.[13]The depiction of the Californiaranchat the beginning of the story was based on the Bond family ranch.[14]

On his return to California, London was unable to find work and relied on odd jobs such as cutting grass. He submitted a query letter to the San FranciscoBulletinproposing a story about his Alaskan adventure, but the idea was rejected because, as the editor told him, ""Interest in Alaska has subsided to an amazing degree.""[8]A few years later, London wrote a short story about a dog named Bâtard who, at the end of the story, kills his master. London sold the piece toCosmopolitan Magazine, which published it in the June 1902 issue under the title ""Diablo – A Dog"".[15]London's biographer,Earle Labor, says that London then began work onThe Call of the Wildto ""redeem the species"" from his dark characterization of dogs in ""Bâtard"". Expecting to write a short story, London explains: ""I meant it to be a companion to my other dog story 'Bâtard' ... but it got away from me, and instead of 4,000 words it ran 32,000 before I could call a halt.""[16]

Written as a frontier story about the gold rush,The Call of the Wildwas meant for thepulpmarket. It was first published in five installments inThe Saturday Evening Post, which bought it for $750 in 1903 (~$26,247 in 2024).[17][18]In the same year, London sold all rights to the story toMacmillan, which published it in book format.[18]The book has never been out of print since that time.[18]

The Call of the Wildfalls into the categories ofadventure fictionand what is sometimes referred to as the animal story genre, in which an author attempts to write an animal protagonist without resorting toanthropomorphism. At the time, London was criticized for attributing ""unnatural"" human thoughts and insights to a dog, so much so that he was accused of being anature faker.[22]London himself dismissed these criticisms as ""homocentric"" and ""amateur"".[23]London further responded that he had set out to portray nature more accurately than his predecessors.

Along with his contemporariesFrank NorrisandTheodore Dreiser, London was influenced by thenaturalismof European writers such asÉmile Zola, in which themes such as heredity versus environment were explored. London's use of the genre gave it a new vibrancy, according to scholar Richard Lehan.[25]

The story is also an example of Americanpastoralism—a prevailing theme in American literature—in which the mythic hero returns to nature. As with other characters of American literature, such asRip van WinkleandHuckleberry Finn, Buck symbolizes a reaction against industrialization and social convention with a return to nature. London presents themotifsimply, clearly, and powerfully in the story, a motif later echoed by 20th-century American writersWilliam FaulknerandErnest Hemingway(most notably in ""Big Two-Hearted River"").[26]E.L. Doctorowsays of the story that it is ""fervently American"".[27]

The enduring appeal of the story, according to American literature scholarDonald Pizer, is that it is a combination ofallegory,parable, andfable. The story incorporates elements of age-old animal fables, such asAesop's Fables,in which animals speak the truth, and traditional beast fables, in which the beast ""substitutes wit for insight"".[28]London was influenced byRudyard Kipling'sThe Jungle Book, written a few years earlier, with its combination of parable and animal fable,[29]and by other animal stories popular in the early 20th century. InThe Call of the Wild, London intensifies and adds layers of meaning that are lacking in these stories.[16]

As a writer, London tended to skimp on form, according to biographer Labor, and neitherThe Call of the WildnorWhite Fang""is a conventional novel"".[30]The story follows the archetypal ""myth of the hero""; Buck, who is the hero, takes a journey, is transformed, and achieves anapotheosis. The format of the story is divided into four distinct parts, according to Labor. In the first part, Buck experiences violence and struggles for survival; in the second part, he proves himself a leader of the pack; the third part brings him to his death (symbolically and almost literally); and in the fourth and final part, he undergoes rebirth.[31]

London's story is a tale of survival and a return toprimitivism. Pizer writes that: ""the strong, the shrewd, and the cunning shall prevail when ...life is bestial"".[32]

Pizer also finds evidence in the story of a Christian theme of love and redemption, as shown by Buck's refusal to revert to violence until after the death of Thornton, who had won Buck's love and loyalty.[33]London, who went so far as to fight for custody of one of his own dogs, understood that loyalty between dogs (particularly working dogs) and their masters is built on trust and love.[34]

Writing in the ""Introduction"" to theModern Libraryedition ofThe Call of the Wild,E. L. Doctorowsays the theme is based onDarwin's concept of the survival of the fittest. London places Buck in conflict with humans, in conflict with the other dogs, and in conflict with his environment—all of which he must challenge, survive, and conquer.[27]Buck, a domesticated dog, must call on hisatavistichereditary traits to survive; he must learn to be wild to become wild, according to Tina Gianquitto. He learns that in a world where ""the club and the fang"" are law, where the law of the pack rules and a good-natured dog such as Curly can be torn to pieces by pack members, survival by whatever means is paramount.[35]

London also explores the idea of ""nature vs. nurture"". Buck, raised as a pet, is by heredity a wolf. The change of environment brings up his innate characteristics and strengths to the point where he fights for survival and becomes the leader of the pack. Pizer describes how the story reflects human nature in its prevailing theme of strength, particularly in the face of harsh circumstances.[33]

The veneer of civilization is thin and fragile, writes Doctorow, and London exposes the brutality at the core of humanity and the ease with which humans revert to a state of primitivism.[27]His interest inMarxismis evident in the sub-theme that humanity is motivated by materialism, and his interest inNietzscheanphilosophy is shown by Buck's characterization.[27]Gianquitto writes that in Buck's characterization, London created a type of NietzscheanÜbermensch– in this case a dog that reaches mythic proportions.[36]

Doctorow sees the story as a caricature of abildungsroman– in which a character learns and grows – in that Buck becomes progressively less civilized.[27]Gianquitto explains that Buck has evolved to the point that he is ready to join a wolf pack, which has a social structure uniquely adapted to and successful in the harsh Arctic environment, unlike humans, who are weak in the harsh environment.[37]

The first chapter opens with the first quatrain ofJohn Myers O'Hara's poem,Atavism,[38]published in 1902 inThe Bookman. Thestanzaoutlines one of the main motifs ofThe Call of the Wild: that Buck when removed from the ""sun-kissed""Santa Clara Valleywhere he was raised, will revert to his wolf heritage with its innate instincts and characteristics.[39]

The themes are conveyed through London's use of symbolism and imagery which, according to Labor, vary in the different phases of the story. The imagery and symbolism in the first phase, to do with the journey and self-discovery, depict physical violence, with strong images of pain and blood. In the second phase, fatigue becomes a dominant image and death is a dominant symbol, as Buck comes close to being killed. The third phase is a period of renewal and rebirth and takes place in the spring, before ending with the fourth phase, when Buck fully reverts to nature and is placed in a vast and ""weird atmosphere"", a place of pure emptiness.[40]

The setting is allegorical. The southern lands represent the soft, materialistic world; the northern lands symbolize a world beyond civilization and are inherently competitive.[33]The harshness, brutality, and emptiness in Alaska reduce life to its essence, as London learned, and it shows in Buck's story. Buck must defeat Spitz, the dog who symbolically tries to get ahead and take control. When Buck is sold to Charles, Hal, and Mercedes, he finds himself in a dirty camp. They treat their dogs badly; they are artificial interlopers in the pristine landscape. Conversely, Buck's next masters, John Thornton and his two companions are described as ""living close to the earth"". They keep a clean camp, treat their animals well, and represent man's nobility in nature.[26]Unlike Buck, Thornton loses his fight with his fellow species, and not until Thornton's death does Buck revert fully to the wild and his primordial state.[41]

The characters too are symbolic of types. Charles, Hal, and Mercedes symbolize vanity and ignorance, while Thornton and his companions represent loyalty, purity, and love.[33]Much of the imagery is stark and simple, with an emphasis on images of cold, snow, ice, darkness, meat, and blood.[41]

London varied his prose style to reflect the action. He wrote in an over-affected style in his descriptions of Charles, Hal, and Mercedes' camp as a reflection of their intrusion into the wilderness. Conversely, when describing Buck and his actions, London wrote in a style that was pared down and simple—a style that would influence and be the forebear of Hemingway's style.[26]

The story was written as a frontier adventure and in such a way that it worked well as a serial. As Doctorow points out, it is good episodic writing that embodies the style of magazine adventure writing popular in that period. ""It leaves us with satisfaction at its outcome, a story well and truly told,"" he said.[27]

The Call of the Wildwas enormously popular from the moment it was published.H. L. Menckenwrote of London's story: ""No other popular writer of his time did any better writing than you will find inThe Call of the Wild.""[4]A reviewer forThe New York Timeswrote of it in 1903: ""If nothing else makes Mr. London's book popular, it ought to be rendered so by the complete way in which it will satisfy the love of dog fights apparently inherent in every man.""[42]The reviewer forThe Atlantic Monthlywrote that it was a book: ""untouched by bookishness...The making and the achievement of such a hero [Buck] constitute, not a pretty story at all, but a very powerful one.""[43]

The book secured London a place in thecanon of American literature.[36]The first printing of 10,000 copies sold out immediately; it is still one of the best-known stories written by an American author and continues to be read and taught in schools.[27][44]It has been published in 47 languages.[45]London's first success, the book secured his prospects as a writer and gained him a readership that stayed with him throughout his career.[27][36]

After the success ofThe Call of the Wild, London wrote to Macmillan in 1904 proposing a second book (White Fang) in which he wanted to describe the opposite of Buck: a dog that transforms from wild to tame: ""I'm going to reverse the process...Instead of devolution of decivilization ... I'm going to give the evolution, the civilization of a dog.""[46]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1514,A Midsummer Night's Dream,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream,"The play consists of several interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of DukeTheseusofAthensand theAmazonqueenHippolyta.
Most of the action occurs in the woodland realm ofFairyland, under the light of the moon.

The play opens withTheseusandHippolytawho are 4 days away from their wedding. Theseus is unhappy about how long he has to wait while Hippolyta thinks it will pass by like a dream. Theseus is confronted byEgeusand his daughterHermia, who is in love withLysander, and resistant to her father's demand that she marry Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenianlawbefore Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelongchastityas anunworshipping the goddessDiana, but the two lovers both deny his choice and make a secret plan to escape into the forest for Lysander's aunt's house, to run away from Theseus. Hermia tells their plans toHelena, her best friend, who pinesunrequitedlyfor Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, Helena tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia.

Themechanicals,Peter Quinceand fellow playersNick Bottom,Francis Flute,Robin Starveling,Tom SnoutandSnugplan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, ""the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death ofPyramus and Thisbe"". Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather play a tyrant and recites some lines ofErcles. Bottom is told by Quince that he would play the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and other ladies so much that the Duke and Lords would have the playershanged. Snug remarks that he needs Lion's part because he is ""slow of study"". Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is ""nothing but roaring."" Quince then ends the meeting by telling his actors ""At the Duke's oak we meet"".

In a parallel plot line,Oberon, king of the fairies, andTitania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indianchangelingto Oberon for use as his ""knight"" or ""henchman"" since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania. He calls upon Robin ""Puck"" Goodfellow, his ""shrewd and knavish sprite"", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called ""love-in-idleness"", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, ""And ere I take this charm from off her sight, / As I can take it with another herb, / I'll make her render up her page to me."" Helena and Demetrius enter, with her continuously making advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.

As Titania is lulled to sleep by her fairies, Oberon sneaks up and places the flower juice on her eyes, exiting the stage afterwards. Lysander and Hermia enter, lost and exhausted from the journey. Hermia rejects Lysander's advances to sleep together, and the two lie down on different corners. Puck enters and mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, thinking Lysander is mocking her, runs away. Lysander follows her. When Hermia wakes up after dreaming a snake ate her heart, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him.

Meanwhile, Quince and his band of five labourers (""rudemechanicals"", as Puck describes them) have arranged to perform their play aboutPyramus and Thisbefor Theseus's wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania'sbower, for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for ajackass) transforms his head into that of adonkey. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him. (In the words of the play, ""Titania waked, and straightway loved an ass."") She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes thechangelingboy.

Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon condemns Puck's mistake and sends him to get Helena while he charms Demetrius's eyes. Upon waking, he sees Helena arguing with Lysander, and instantly falls in love with her. Now under the spell, the two men are both in love with her. However, Helena is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, instead loving Helena. This soon turns into a quarrel between the two ladies, with Helena chiding Hermia for joining in the mockery session, followed by the latter furiously charging at her for stealing her true love's heart and blaming her for the supposed 'mockery'. Oberon and Puck decide that they must resolve this conflict, and by the morning, none of them will have any memory of what happened, as if it were a dream. Oberon arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius, and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the antidote to Lysander, returning his love to Hermia again, and cast another spell over the four Athenian lovers, claiming all will be well in the morning. Once they awaken, the lovers assume that whatever happened was a dream and not reality.

Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania and orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom. The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and cannot recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream, as they walk back to Athens.

After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream ""past the wit of man"". At Quince's house, Quince and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns and the actors get ready to put on ""Pyramus and Thisbe"".

In the final scene of the play, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen performPyramus and Thisbein Athens. The mechanicals are so terrible at playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck ""restores amends"" and suggests that what theaudienceexperienced might just be a dream.

It is unknown exactly whenA Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion toEdmund Spenser'sEpithalamion, it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that ofThomas BerkeleyandElizabeth Carey), while others suggest that it was written forthe Queento celebrate thefeast dayofSt. John, but no evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed atThe Theatreand, later,The Globe. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such asOvid'sMetamorphosesandChaucer's ""The Knight's Tale"" served as inspiration.[2]Aristophanes' classical Greek comedyThe Birds(also set in the countryside near Athens) has been proposed as a source due to the fact that both Procne and Titania are awakened by male characters (Hoopoe and Bottom the Weaver) who have animal heads and who sing two-stanza songs about birds.[3]According to John Twyning, the play's plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a ""riff"" onDer Busant, aMiddle High Germanpoem.[4]

According to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completedRomeo and Julietand was still in contemplation ofThe Merchant of Venice. The play belongs to the author's early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to thelyricismof his works.[5]

The play was entered into theRegisterof theStationers' Companyon 8 October 1600 by the bookseller Thomas Fisher, who published thefirst quartoedition later that year.[6]Asecond quartowas printed in 1619 byWilliam Jaggard, as part of his so-calledFalse Folio.[6]The play next appeared in print in theFirst Folioof 1623. The title page ofQ1states that the play was ""sundry times publickely acted"" prior to 1600.[7]According to Sukanta Chaudhuri, editor of the 2017 Arden edition of A Midsummer Night's Dream, ""The only firm evidence for the date of Dream is its mention in Francis Meres's Palladis Tamia, which appeared in 1598"" (p. 283). Chaudhuri's exhaustive investigation of its original date of performance points to 1595 or 1596 (likely for the wedding of either William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby to Elizabeth de Vere, or Thomas Berkeley, son of Henry Lord Berkeley, to Elizabeth Carey) (p. 284-5). Further consolidations of this late Elizabethan date are provided by ""Oberon's unmissable compliment to Queen Elizabeth (2.1.155-164)"" (Chaudhuri), and Titania's description of flooded fields and failed crops which occurred through England in the years 1594-1597/8 (2.1.84-121). The first court performance known with certainty occurred atHampton Courton 1 January 1604, as a prelude toThe Masque of Indian and China Knights.[8]

InAncient Greece, long before the creation of the Christian celebrations ofSt. John's Day, the summer solstice was marked byAdonia, a festival to mourn the death ofAdonis, the devoted mortal lover of the goddessAphrodite. According toOvid'sMetamorphoses, Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to theunderworldto be raised byPersephone. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover's arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the colour of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.

The story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare's own hugely popular narrative poem,Venus and Adonis, written while London's theatres were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.[9]

The wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.

Both David Wiles of theUniversity of LondonandHarold BloomofYale Universityhave strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes ofCarnivalesque,Bacchanalia, andSaturnalia.[10]Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: ""The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounterA Midsummer Night's Dreamas a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.""[11]Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.[12]

David Bevingtonargues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Queen Titania's eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass.[13]In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it.[14]Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.

There is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that ""four happy days bring in another moon"".[15]The wood episode then takes place at a night of no Moon, but Lysander asserts that ""there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.""[16]Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight,[17]which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean ""four days until the next month"". Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the Moon is not seen due to its closeness to the Sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal ""dark of the moon"" period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming ""And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.""; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title withMay Day, furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they ""observe The rite of May"".[18]

Maurice Hunt, former Chair of the English Department atBaylor University, writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible ""that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play"".[19]By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader's mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story.[19]It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute.[19]Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.[19]

Victor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: ""It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.""[20]He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: ""It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.""[21]

The aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes ""Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.""[22]In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that ""To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.""[22]He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events ofA Midsummer Night's Dream. As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.[22]

In his essay ""Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories andA Midsummer Night's Dream"",Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay ""does not (seek to) rewriteA Midsummer Night's Dreamas a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations' ... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.""[23]

Green does not consider Shakespeare to have been a ""sexual radical"", but that the play represented a ""topsy-turvy world"" or ""temporary holiday"" that mediates or negotiates the ""discontents of civilisation"", which while resolved neatly in the story's conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life.[24]Green writes that the ""sodomitical elements"", ""homoeroticism"", ""lesbianism"", and even ""compulsory heterosexuality""—the first hint of which may be Oberon's obsession with Titania's changeling ward—in the story must be considered in the context of the ""culture of early modern England"" as a commentary on the ""aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order"".[24]

Male dominance is one thematic element found in the play. InA Midsummer Night's Dream, Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition.[25]InThe Imperial Votaress, Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, ""The festive conclusion inA Midsummer Night's Dreamdepends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.""[26]He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the ""sexual blood shed by 'virgins'"". While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.[27]

There are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his bookPower on Display, Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem inA Midsummer Night's Dreamis the problem of ""authority gone archaic"".[28]The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father's will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom's dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus' political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This can be compared to the time ofElizabeth I, in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth's succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father's will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.[29]

Dorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary ofSamuel Pepys. He found the play to be ""the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life"".[30]He did, however, admit that it had ""some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure"".[30]

The next critic known to comment on the play wasJohn Dryden, writingThe Authors Apology for Heroique Poetry; and Poetique Licencein 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whetherfairiesshould be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive frompopular belief. And fairies are of this sort, as arepygmiesand the extraordinary effects ofmagic. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays:A Midsummer Night's Dream,The Tempest, andBen Jonson'sThe Masque of Queens.[30]

Charles Gildonin the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works ofOvidandVirgil, and that he could read them in the originalLatinand not in later translations.[30]

William Duff, writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare's strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved.[30]His contemporaryFrancis Gentleman, an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a ""puerile"" plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.[31]

Edmond Malone, a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a properdecorum. He found that the ""more exalted characters"" (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone's main argument seems to derive from theclassismof his era. He assumes that thearistocratshad to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.[32]

According to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 withAugust Wilhelm Schlegel. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey's head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom's true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as aburlesqueof the Athenian lovers.[32]In 1817,William Hazlittfound the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be ""a delightful fiction""[32]but when staged, it is reduced to a dullpantomime. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together.[32]Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play's supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.[32]

In 1811–1812,Samuel Taylor Coleridgemade two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as adream. Second, that Helena is guilty of ""ungrateful treachery"" to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack ofprinciplesin women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moralevil, though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introducegenderissues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge's ownmisogyny, rather than genuine reflections of Helena's morality.[33]

In 1837,William Maginnproduced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about ""the lunatic, the lover, and the poet""[a]and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whomFortuneshowered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of thefairy queen: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that ""Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.""[34]Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the ""caprices""[34]of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.[34]

In 1839, the philosopherHermann Ulriciwrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views ofPlatonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence fromPlatoand his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication ofparodyabout class differences.[34]

James Halliwell-Phillipps, writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.[30]

In 1849,Charles Knightalso wrote about the play and its apparent lack of propersocial stratification. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its ""Thesean harmony""[36]reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be ""subtle and ethereal"", and standing aboveliterary criticismand its reductive reasoning.[37]

Also in 1849,Georg Gottfried Gervinuswrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and anallegory. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks infilial obedienceand acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they ""woo by moonlight""[36]behind their parents' backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as ""personified dream gods"".[36]They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.[36]

Gervinus also wrote on where thefairylandof the play is located. Not inAttica, but in theIndies. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced byOrientalism. He speaks of the Indies as scented with thearomaof flowers, and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely ""delight[s] in her beauty, her 'swimming gait,' and her powers of imitation"".[36]Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, for which Gervinus blames her.[36]

Gervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with ""hard hands and thick heads"".[36]They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.[36]

In 1863,Charles Cowden Clarkealso wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholarMary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.[38]

In 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view.[39]In 1881,Edward Dowdenargued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the ""heroic men of action""[39]so central to Shakespeare's theatrical works.[39]

BothHorace Howard Furnessand Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views.[39]Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play.[30]Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play's quality.[30]

In 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as adialectic, either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a ""horrid brute"".[39]

Towards the end of the 19th century,Georg Brandes(1895–6) andFrederick S. Boas(1896) were the last major additions toA Midsummer Night's Dreamcriticism.[39]Brandes' approach anticipates laterpsychological readings, seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and ""typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination"".[40]Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the ""domain of the unconscious"".[40]Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, ""essentially English and Elizabethan"".[40]He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to ""concentrate the four lovers on a single spot"";[40]and thePyramus and Thisbeplay-within-the-play a parody of a prominenttoposof contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: ""This is recognizably modern criticism.""[40]

The 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and theartisans. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play.[41]Also in 1961,Frank Kermodewrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works ofMacrobius,Apuleius, andGiordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from theFirst Epistle to the CorinthiansbyPaul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.[41][b]

In 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of ""dotage"".[41]Genuine love is contrasted with theunrequited love(and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.[42]

Dent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character ofTheseusfromGreek mythology, a creation himself of ""antique fable"".[41]Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He cannot tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.[42]

Also in 1964,Jan Kottoffered his own views on the play. He saw the main themes of the play as being violence and ""unrepressed animalistic sexuality"".[43]Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, whose love interests are exchangeable andobjectified. Thechangelingthat Oberon desires is his new ""sexual toy"".[43]The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, arepromiscuous. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves.[43]Kott's views were controversial, and contemporary critics wrote either in favour of or against his ideas, but few ignored them.[43]

In 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe.[43]In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the ""terrifying power""[43]of the fairies and argued that they control the play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethicallyambivalentcharacters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.[44]

In 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.[45]

In 1970, R. A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle ofdiscordia concorsin several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.[45]

In 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts ofillusion. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.[46]

Also in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the ""eternal truths""[47]ofPlatonismand Christianity.[47]

Also writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually aself-destructiveexpression ofpassion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by asadomasochistictype of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His ownegotismprotects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale ofPyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare'sRomeo and Juliet.[47]

In 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.[30]

In 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned withepistemologyin this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination.[47]Also in 1972,Thomas McFarlandargued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.[48]

In 1974,Marjorie Garberargued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform.[49]Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.[49]

In 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity.[49]Also in 1975,David Bevingtonoffered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may bebisexualand his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is ""unknowable and incomprehensible"".[49]According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.[49]

In 1977,Anne Paolucciargued that the play lasts five days.[30]

In 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into theLabyrinthof theMinotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and forElizabethansthe woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomesAriadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth,Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.[50]

Also in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality.[51]In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories ofcultural anthropology. She argued that the play is about traditionalrites of passage, which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to thecommunitasof the woods. The woods serve here as thecommunitas, a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified thiscommunitaswith the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is ""societas"", the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism ofcommunitasand structure.[51]

Also in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them ""a new humility, a healthy sense of folly"".[51]They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.[51]

Some of the interpretations of the play have been based onpsychologyand its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents theconscious mindand Puck represents theunconscious mind. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as atrickster, while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept offertility. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters.[52]In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their ""authentic sexual selves"".[52]In 1979,Norman N. Hollandappliedpsychoanalytic literary criticismto the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is herdefence mechanism. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.[52]

In 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning ofEros(Love) andThanatos(Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release ofsexual tension. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.[53]

In 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony.Patriarchyitself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity.[54]In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.[54]

In 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation ofabsolute monarchy, and makes visible for examination the maintenance process ofhegemonicorder.[54]

During the years of thePuritanInterregnumwhen the theatres were closed (1642–1660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as adroll. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660,A Midsummer Night's Dreamwas acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays.Samuel Pepyssaw it on 29 September 1662 and thought it ""the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw ...""[55]

After the Jacobean / Caroline era,A Midsummer Night's Dreamwas never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms likeHenry Purcell's musical masque/playThe Fairy Queen(1692), which had a successful run at theDorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived.Richard Leveridgeturned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted atLincoln's Inn Fieldsin 1716.John Frederick Lampeelaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale ofLove in a Forest, his 1723 adaptation ofAs You Like It. In 1755,David Garrickdid the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation calledThe Fairies.Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.[56]

In 1840,Madame VestrisatCovent Gardenreturned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon andPuckwould always be played by women.[57]

After the success of Madame Vestris' production,19th-century theatrecontinued to stage theDreamas a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies were portrayed as gossamer-winged ballerinas. TheoverturebyFelix Mendelssohnwas always used throughout this period.Augustin Daly's production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances.[58]

In 1905Oscar Aschestaged a production at theAdelphi Theatrein London with himself as Bottom andBeatrice Ferraras Puck.[59]Herbert Beerbohm Treestaged a 1911 production which featured ""mechanical birds twittering in beech trees, a simulated stream, fairies wearing battery-operated lighting, and live rabbits following trails of food across the stage.""[60]

Max ReinhardtstagedA Midsummer Night's Dreamthirteen times between 1905 and 1934,[61]introducing a revolving set.[62]After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at theHollywood Bowlin September 1934.[61]The shell was removed and replaced by a forest planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage.[63]The wedding procession inserted between Acts IV and V crossed the trestle with torches down the hillside.[64]The cast includedJames Cagney,[65]Olivia de Havilland,[66]Mickey Rooney,[67]Victor Jory, and a corps of dancers that includedButterfly McQueen.[68]The play was accompanied by Mendelssohn's music.[69]

On the strength of this production,Warner Brotherssigned Reinhardt to directa filmed version, Hollywood's first Shakespeare movie sinceDouglas Fairbanks Sr.andMary Pickford'sTaming of the Shrewin 1929.[70]Jory (Oberon), Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) reprised their roles from the Hollywood Bowl cast.[71]James Cagneystarred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom.[72]Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles just this once includedJoe E. BrownandDick Powell.[73]Erich Wolfgang Korngoldwas brought from Austria to arrange Mendelssohn's music for the film.[74]He used not only theMidsummer Night's Dreammusic but also several other pieces by Mendelssohn. Korngold went on to make a legendary career in Hollywood, remaining in the United States afterNazi Germanyannexed Austria.[69]

DirectorHarley Granville-Barkerintroduced in 1914 a less spectacular way of staging theDream: he reduced the size of the cast and used Elizabethan folk music instead of Mendelssohn. He replaced large, complex sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He portrayed the fairies as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on Cambodian idols. His simpler, sparer staging significantly influenced subsequent productions.[citation needed]

In 1970,Peter Brookstaged the playfor theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged incircustricks such astrapezeartistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently common notion of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals. British actors who played roles in Brook's production includedPatrick Stewart,Ben Kingsley, John Kane (Puck) andFrances de la Tour(Helena). Recordings documenting this production survive.[75]

A Midsummer Night's Dreamhas been produced many times in New York, including a production by theTheatre for a New Audience, produced byJoseph Pappat thePublic Theater, and also several stagings by theNew York Shakespeare Festivalat theDelacorte Theatrein Central Park. In 1978, theRiverside Shakespeare Companystaged an outdoor production starring Eric Hoffmann as Puck, with Karen Hurley as Titania and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by company founder Gloria Skurski. There have been several variations since then, including some set in the 1980s.[citation needed]

The Maryland Shakespeare Players atUniversity of Marylandstaged a queer production in 2015 in which the lovers were same-sex couples and the mechanicals were drag queens.[76]

TheUniversity of Michigan'sNichols Arboretum's programmeShakespeare in the Arbhas presented a play every summer since 2001. Shakespeare in the Arb has producedA Midsummer Night's Dreamthree times. These performances take place in a 123-acre (50 ha) natural setting, with lush woods, a flowing river, and steep hills. The performance takes place in several places, with actors and audience moving together to each setting. ""As one critic commented, 'The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.'""[77]

Artistic directorEmma Rice's first production atShakespeare's Globein 2016 was a version of the play. While not ""a production to please the purists"", it received praise. A contemporary reworking, it included gender-switched characters andBollywoodinfluences.[78]

Absurda Comica, oder Herr Peter SquentzbyAndreas Gryphius, which was probably written between 1648 and 1650 and was published in 1657, is evidently based on the comic episode ofPyramusandThisbeinA Midsummer Night's Dream.

Ken Ludwig's 2003 comic play,Shakespeare in Hollywood, is set during the production of the1935 film. Oberon and Puck appear on the scene, and find themselves cast as themselves.[79][80]

The play was translated intoEsperanto(constructedinternational auxiliary language) byLouise Briggsin 1920.[81]

W. Stanley Mossused the quotation ""Ill met by moonlight"" as the title of hisIll Met by Moonlight(1950), a non-fiction book about thekidnap of General Kreipeduring WWII.[82]The book was adapted into afilm with the same namein 1957.[83]

Botho Strauß's playThe Park(1983) is based on characters andmotifsfromA Midsummer Night's Dream.[84]

Neil Gaiman's comic seriesThe Sandmanuses the play in the 1990 issue ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". In this story, Shakespeare and his company perform the play for the real Oberon and Titania and an audience of fairies. The play is heavily quoted in the comic, and Shakespeare's sonHamnetappears in the play as the Indian boy. This issue was the first and only comic to win theWorld Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction, in 1991.[85]

Terry Pratchett's bookLords and Ladies(1992) is aparodyof the play.[86]

Bernard Cornwell's novelFools and Mortals(2017) is about the creation and first performance of the play, as seen by the young actor, Richard Shakespeare, brother of the playwright.[87]

The Fairy-Queenis an opera from 1692 byHenry Purcell, based on the play.[88][89]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69087,The murder of Roger Ackroyd,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd,"Dr James Sheppard, the story'snarrator, lives with his unmarried sister, Caroline, in the English country village of King’s Abbot. Telling the story in his own words, Dr Sheppard recounts being called to certify the death of a wealthy widow, Mrs Ferrars, who has committed suicide a year after her abusive husband's demise. Caroline speculates that Mrs Ferrars had poisoned her husband and has committed suicide out of remorse.

Roger Ackroyd, wealthy widower and owner of Fernly Park, tells Dr Sheppard that he needs to talk to him urgently and invites him to dinner that evening. In addition to Dr Sheppard, the dinner guests include Major Blunt, Ackroyd's sister-in-law Mrs Cecil Ackroyd, her daughter Flora, and Ackroyd'spersonal secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. Flora tells the doctor that she is engaged to Ralph Paton, Ackroyd's stepson, though the engagement is being kept confidential.

In his study after dinner, Ackroyd tells Dr Sheppard that he had been engaged to Mrs Ferrars for several months, and that she had admitted the day before that she had indeed poisoned her husband. She was beingblackmailed, and promised to reveal the blackmailer's name within 24 hours. At this point Ackroyd's butler, Parker, enters with a letter that Mrs Ferrars had posted just before she killed herself. Ackroyd apologetically asks Dr Sheppard to leave so that he can read it alone.

Shortly after arriving back home, the doctor receives a phone call. Dr Sheppard tells Caroline that Ackroyd has been found dead and then returns to Fernly Park. Parker professes to know nothing about the phone call. Unable to get a response at the study door, Sheppard and Parker break it down and find Ackroyd dead in his chair, killed with his own dagger. The letter is missing and footprints are found leading in and out of the study through an open window.

Ralph disappears and becomes the primary suspect when the footprints are found to match shoes that he owns. Flora, convinced that Ralph is innocent, asks the recently retired detectiveHercule Poirotto investigate. He agrees and visits the scene of the crime, asking Dr Sheppard to accompany him.

Parker notes to Poirot that a chair in Ackroyd's study has been moved. Poirot questions the guests and staff, including Ursula Bourne, theparlourmaid, who has no alibi. Thewindow of opportunityfor the murderer after Dr Sheppard's departure appears to have been quite short since Raymond and Blunt later heard Ackroyd talking in his study, and Flora says she saw him just before going up to bed.

Poirot unravels a complex web of intrigue, and presents the missing Ralph Paton – who was, it transpires, already secretly married to Ursula when Ackroyd had decided that he should marry Flora. The pair had arranged a clandestine meeting in the garden. Flora is forced to admit she never in fact saw her uncle after dinner, leaving Raymond and Blunt as the last people to hear Ackroyd alive. Blunt confesses his love for Flora.

Alone with Dr Sheppard, Poirot reveals he knows that Dr Sheppard himself is both Ferrars' blackmailer and Ackroyd's killer. Realising that Mrs Ferrars's letter would implicate him, Sheppard had stabbed Ackroyd before leaving the study. He left publicly through the front door, then put Ralph's shoes on, ran round to the study window and climbed back in. Locking the door from the inside, he set adesk dictaphonegoing, playing a recording of Ackroyd's voice, and pulled out a chair to hide it from the sightline of anyone standing in the doorway. To provide the excuse for returning to Fernly Park, he had asked a patient to call him at home. While Sheppard had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered, he slipped the dictaphone into hismedical bag, and put the chair back in place. These details were concealed from his narrative, which has also now been given to Poirot.

Poirot tells Dr Sheppard the matter will be reported to the police in the morning and suggests he spare his sister Caroline by taking his own life. Sheppard completes his account of Poirot's investigation – the novel itself – with the final chapter,Apologia, serving as his suicide note.

The novel is narrated by Dr James Sheppard, who becomes Poirot's assistant, in place ofCaptain Hastingswho has married and settled inthe Argentine. It includes an unexpectedplot twisttowards the end, when Dr Sheppard reveals he has throughout been anunreliable narrator, using literary techniques to conceal his guilt without writing anything untrue (e.g., ""I did what little had to be done"" at the point where he slipped the dictaphone into his bag and moved the chair).

The review inThe Times Literary Supplementbegan, ""This is a well-written detective story of which the only criticism might perhaps be that there are too many curious incidents not really connected with the crime which have to be elucidated before the true criminal can be discovered"". The review concluded, ""It is all very puzzling, but the great Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian detective, solves the mystery. It may safely be asserted that very few readers will do so.""[10]

A long review inThe New York Times Book Reviewread in part:

The Observerhad high praise for the novel, especially the character Caroline:

The Scotsmanfound the plot to be clever and original:

Howard Haycraft,[14]in his 1941 work,Murder for Pleasure, included the novel in his ""cornerstones"" list of the most influential crime novels ever written.[13]

The English crime writer and criticRobert Barnard, inA Talent to Deceive: An appreciation of Agatha Christie, wrote that this novel is ""Apart—and it is an enormous 'apart'—from the sensational solution, this is a fairly conventional Christie."" He concluded that this is ""A classic, but there are some better [novels by] Christie.""[6]

John Goddard wrote an  analysis of whether Christie 'cheats' with her sensational solution and concluded that the charge of cheating fails.[12]

In a biography of Christie, Laura Thompson argued thatThe Murder of Roger Ackroydwas the ultimate detective novel:

In 1944–1946, the American literary criticEdmund Wilsonattacked the entire mystery genre in a set of three columns inThe New Yorker. The second, in the 20 January 1945 issue, was titled ""Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?"", though he does no analysis of the novel. He dislikes mystery stories altogether, and chose the famous novel as the title of his piece.[16][17]

In 1990,The Murder of Roger Ackroydcame in at fifth place inThe Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a ranking by the members (all crime writers) of theCrime Writers' Associationin Britain.[8]A similar ranking was made in 1995 by theMystery Writers of America, putting this novel in twelfth place.[9]

Literature professor and authorPierre Bayard, in the 1998 workQui a tué Roger Ackroyd?(Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?), re-investigates Agatha Christie'sAckroyd, proposing an alternative solution in another crime novel. He argues in favour of a different murderer – Sheppard's sister, Caroline – and says Christie subconsciously knew who the real culprit is.[18][19]

In 1999, the novel was included in French newspaperLe Monde's list of the100 Books of the Century, chosen by readers from a list of 200.[20]

In 2013, theCrime Writers' Associationvoted the novel as CWA Best Ever Novel.[7]The 600 members of CWA said it was ""the finest example of the genre ever penned."" It is a cornerstone of crime fiction, which ""contains one of the most celebrated plot twists in crime writing history.""[7][21]The poll taken on the 60th anniversary of CWA also honoured Agatha Christie as the best crime novel author ever.[7][21]

In the ""Binge!"" article ofEntertainment WeeklyIssue #1343–44 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers pickedThe Murder of Roger Ackroydas an ""EW and Christie favorite"" on the list of the ""Nine Great Christie Novels"".[22]

The character of Caroline Sheppard was later acknowledged by Christie as a possible precursor to her famous detectiveMiss Marple.[23]: 433

Christie revealed in her 1977 autobiography that the basic idea of the novel was given to her by her brother-in-law, James Watts ofAbney Hall, who suggested a novel in which the criminal would be aDr Watsoncharacter, which Christie considered to be a ""remarkably original thought"".[23]: 342

In March 1924 Christie also received an unsolicited letter fromLord Louis Mountbatten. He had been impressed with her previous works and wrote, courtesy ofThe Sketchmagazine (publishers of many of her short stories at that time) with an idea and notes for a story whose basic premise mirrored the Watts suggestion.[15]: 500Christie acknowledged the letter and after some thought, began to write the book but to a plot line of her invention. She also acknowledged taking inspiration from the infamous case of the unsolved death ofCharles Bravo, who she thought had been murdered by DrJames Manby Gully.[24]

In December 1969 Mountbatten wrote to Christie again after having seen a performance ofThe Mousetrap. He mentioned his letter of the 1920s, and Christie replied, acknowledging the part he played in the conception of the book.[25]: 120–121

The story first appeared as a fifty-four part serialisation in theLondon Evening Newsfrom Thursday, 16 July, to Wednesday, 16 September 1925 under the titleWho Killed Ackroyd?In the United States, the story was serialised in four parts inFlynn's Detective Weeklyfrom 19 June (Volume 16, Number 2) to 10 July 1926 (Volume 16, Number 5). The text was heavily abridged and each instalment carried an uncredited illustration.

The Collins first edition of June 1926 (retailing for seven shillings and sixpence)[2]was Christie's first work placed with that publisher. ""The first book that Agatha wrote for Collins was the one that changed her reputation forever; no doubt she knew, as through 1925 she turned the idea over in her mind, that here she had a winner.""[15]: 155The first United States publisher was The Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 19 June 1926 (retailing at $2.00).[3]

By 1928,The Murder of Roger Ackroydwas available inbraillethrough the UK'sRoyal National Institute for the Blind[26]and was among the first works to be chosen for transfer toGramophone recordfor theirBooks for the Blindlibrary in the autumn of 1935.[27][28]By 1936 it was listed as one of only eight books available in this form.[29]

Christie's dedication in the book reads ""To Punkie, who likes an orthodox detective story, murder, inquest, and suspicion falling on every one in turn!""

""Punkie"" was the family nickname of Christie's sister and eldest sibling, Margaret (""Madge"") Frary Watts (1879–1950). Despite their eleven-year age gap, the sisters remained close throughout their lives. Christie's mother first suggested to her that she should alleviate the boredom of an illness by writing a story. But soon after, when the sisters had been discussing the recently published classic detective story byGaston Leroux,The Mystery of the Yellow Room(1908), Christie said she would like to try writing such a story. Margaret challenged her, saying that she would not be able to do it.[15]: 102In 1916, eight years later, Christie remembered this conversation and was inspired to write her first novel,The Mysterious Affair at Styles.[25]: 77

Margaret Watts wrote a play,The Claimant, based on theTichborne Case, which enjoyed a short run in the West End at theQueen's Theatrefrom 11 September to 18 October 1924, two years before the book publication ofThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd.[25]: 113–115

The dustjacketblurbread as follows:

The book formed the basis of the earliest adaptation of any work of Christie's when the play,Alibi, adapted byMichael Morton, opened at thePrince of Wales Theatrein London on 15 May 1928. It ran for 250 performances withCharles Laughtonas Poirot. Laughton also starred in the Broadway run of the play, retitledThe Fatal Alibi,which opened at theBooth Theatreon 8 February 1932. The American production was not as successful and closed after just 24 performances.Alibiinspired Christie to write her first stage play,Black Coffee. Christie, with her dog Peter, attended the rehearsals ofAlibiand found its ""novelty"" enjoyable.[15]: 277However, ""she was sufficiently irritated by the changes to the original to want to write a play of her own.""[15]: 277

In 2023, the novel was adapted for the stage by Edgar award nominated playwrightMark Shanahan[32]in partnership with Agatha Christie, Ltd.[33]The play received its first public reading at theWestport Country Playhousein June 2023 with Santino Fontana as Dr. Sheppard and Arnie Burton as Poirot.[34]Shortly thereafter, the world premiere production directed by Mark Shanahan opened at theAlley Theatrein Houston, Texas[35]and featured the Alley's resident company of actors with David Sinaiko as Poirot. The Houston Chronicle reviewed the play, calling it ""a whodunnit done right. This world premiere adaptation elegantly transfers Christie’s rich mystery from the page to the stage...""[36]The play opened on 21 July and ran through 27 August in a limited run as part of the Alley Theatre's Summer Chills series[37]and was subsequently published by Concord Theatricals[38]before receiving numerous productions. The adaptation remains mostly faithful to the book, with Shanahan stating that crafting the adaptation was a ""labour of love.""[39]

The play was turned into the first sound film based on a Christie work. Running 75 minutes, it was released on 28 April 1931, by Twickenham Film Studios and produced by Julius S. Hagan.Austin Trevorplayed Poirot, a role he reprised later that year in the film adaptation of Christie's 1930 play,Black Coffee.Alibiis considered to be alost film.

Orson Wellesadapted the novel as a one-hourradio playfor the 12 November 1939 episode ofThe Campbell Playhouse. Welles played both Dr Sheppard and Hercule Poirot. The play was adapted byHerman J. Mankiewicz,[40]: 355[41]produced by Welles and John Houseman, and directed by Welles.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042,The Tempest,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest,"Twelve years before the action of the play,Prospero, formerly Duke ofMilanand a gifted sorcerer, had been usurped by his treacherous brother Antonio with the aid of Alonso, King ofNaples. Escaping by boat with his infant daughterMiranda, Prospero flees to a remote island where he has been living ever since.  There he used his magic to force the island's only inhabitant,Caliban, to protect him and Miranda. He also frees the spiritArieland binds them into servitude.

When a ship carrying his brother Antonio passes nearby, Prospero conjures up a storm with help from Ariel and the ship is destroyed. Antonio is shipwrecked, along with Alonso, Ferdinand (Alonso's son and heir to the throne), Sebastian (Alonso's brother), Gonzalo (Prospero's trustworthy minister), Adrian, and other court members.

Prospero enacts a sophisticated plan to take revenge on his usurpers and regain his dukedom. Using magic, he separates the shipwreck survivors into groups on the island:

Prospero intends that Miranda, now aged 15, will marry Ferdinand, and he instructs Ariel to bring some other spirits and produce a masque.

The masque will feature classical goddesses,Juno,Ceres, andIris, and will bless and celebrate the betrothal. The masque will also instruct the young couple on marriage, and on the value of chastity until then.

The masque is suddenly interrupted when Prospero realises he had forgotten the plot against his life. Once Ferdinand and Miranda are gone, Prospero orders Ariel to deal with the nobles' plot. Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano are then chased off into the swamps by goblins in the shape of hounds.

Prospero vows that once he achieves his goals, he will set Ariel free, and abandon his magic, saying:

Ariel brings on Alonso, Antonio, and Sebastian. Prospero forgives all three. Prospero's former title, Duke of Milan, is restored. Ariel fetches the sailors from the ship, and then Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano. Caliban, seemingly filled with regret, promises to be good. Stephano and Trinculo are ridiculed and sent away in shame by Prospero. Before the reunited group (all the noble characters with the addition of Miranda and Prospero) leave the island, Ariel is instructed to provide good weather to guide the king's ship back to the royal fleet and then to Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda will be married. After this, Ariel is set free.

In an epilogue, Prospero requests that the audience set him free — with their applause.

It is not known for certain exactly whenThe Tempestwas written, but evidence supports the idea that it was probably composed sometime between late 1610 to mid-1611.[2][3]Evidence supports composition perhaps occurring before, after, or at the same time asThe Winter's Tale.[2]It is considered one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone. But it was not, as is sometimes claimed, Shakespeare's last play, since it is post-dated by his collaborations withJohn Fletcher:Henry VIII,CardenioandThe Two Noble Kinsmen.[4]Edward BlountenteredThe Tempestinto theStationers' Registeron 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespeare plays that Blount registered on that date.[5]

There is no obvious singlesource textfor the plot ofThe Tempest: it appears to have been created by Shakespeare with several sources contributing.[6]

The Sea Venture:William Strachey'sA True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, an eyewitness report of the real-life shipwreck of theSea Venturein 1609 on the island ofBermudawhile sailing towardVirginia, may be considered a primary source for the opening scene, as well as a few other references in the play to conspiracies and retributions.[7]Although not published until 1625, Strachey's report was first recounted in his ""Letter to an Excellent Lady"", a private letter describing the incident and the earliest account of all. It was dated 15 July 1610, and it is thought that Shakespeare - who had personal connections with a number of members of the Virginia Company - may have seen the original sometime during that year.[8][9]At around the time Shakespeare could have read Strachey's letter, anotherSea Venturesurvivor,Silvester Jourdain, published his account,A Discovery of The Barmudas, otherwise Called the Ile of Divels.[10]Also there is the Council of Virginia's 1610 pamphletTrue Declaration of the state of the Colonie in Virginia, with a confutation of such scandalous reports as have tended to the disgrace of so worthy an enterprise.[11]Regarding the influence of Strachey on the play,Kenneth Muirsays that although ""there is little doubt that Shakespeare had read ... William Strachey'sTrue Reportory"" and other accounts, ""the extent of the verbal echoes of [the Bermuda] pamphlets has, I think, been exaggerated. There is hardly a shipwreck in history or fiction which does not mention splitting, in which the ship is not lightened of its cargo, in which the passengers do not give themselves up for lost, in which north winds are not sharp, and in which no one gets to shore by clinging to wreckage.""[12]

Montagne'sOf The Canibales:Gonzalo's description of his ideal society[13]thematically and verbally echoesMontaigne'sessayOf the Canibales, translated into English in a version published byJohn Florioin 1603. Montaigne praises the society of theCaribbeannatives: ""It is a nation ... that hath no kinde of traffike, no knowledge of Letters, no intelligence of numbers, no name of magistrate, nor of politike superioritie; no use of service, of riches, or of poverty; no contracts, no successions, no dividences, no occupation but idle; no respect of kinred, but common, no apparrell but natural, no manuring of lands, no use of wine, corne, or mettle. The very words that import lying, falsehood, treason, dissimulation, covetousnes, envie, detraction, and pardon, were never heard of amongst them.""[14]

Ovid'sMetamorphoses:A source for Prospero's speech in act five, in which he bids farewell to magic[15]is an invocation by the sorceressMedeafound in Ovid's poemMetamorphoses. Medea calls out:

Shakespeare's Prospero begins his invocation:

Other Sources: Other shipwreck narratives probably drawn on by Shakespeare include those ofAntonio Pigafettacontained in Richard Eden's travel anthologies of 1555 and 1557.[19]And some of the characters' names may derive from a 1594History of Italy.[20]

The Tempestmay take its overall structure from traditional Italiancommedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured amagusand his daughter, their supernatural attendants, and a number of rustics. Thecommediaoften featured aclownknown asArlecchino(or his predecessor,Zanni) and his partnerBrighella, who bear a striking resemblance to Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father,Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.[21]Other dramatic influences on Prospero's character includeGreene'sFriar Bacon,Marlowe'sDr. Faustusand Shakespeare's ownOwen Glendower.[22]Bremo inMucedorusmay have influenced Caliban.[23]

Scholars have debated the influence ofVirgil'sAeneid, which Robert Wiltenburg described as ""the main source of the play ... not the source of the plot ... but the work to which Shakespeare is responding"".[24]

Recently, scholars have also identified the influence on the Tempest ofMarston'sThe Malcontent,[25]Beaumont and Fletcher'sPhilaster[25]and the anonymous romancePrimaleon, Prince of Greece.[26]

The Tempestfirst appeared in print in 1623 in the collection of 36 of Shakespeare's plays entitled,Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies; Published according to the True and Original Copies, which is known as theFirst Folio. The plays, includingThe Tempest, were gathered and edited byJohn HemingesandHenry Condell.[27]

The Folio text was based on a handwritten manuscript ofThe Tempestprepared byRalph Crane, ascriveneremployed by the King's Men. Crane probably copied from Shakespeare's rough draft, and based his style on Ben Jonson's Folio of 1616. Crane is thought to have neatened texts, edited the divisions of acts and scenes, and sometimes added his own improvements. He was fond of joining words with hyphens, and using elisions with apostrophes, for example by changing ""with the king"" to read: ""wi'th' King"".[28]The elaborate stage directions inThe Tempestmay have been due to Crane; they provide evidence regarding how the play was staged by the King's Men.[29]

The entire First Folio project was delivered to the blind printer,William Jaggard, and printing began in 1622.The Tempestis the first play in the publication. It was proofread and printed with special care; it is the most well-printed and the cleanest text of the thirty-six plays. To do the work of setting the type in the printing press, three compositors were used forThe Tempest. In the 1960s, a landmark bibliographic study of the First Folio was accomplished byCharlton Hinman. Based on distinctive quirks in the printed words on the page, the study was able to individuate the compositors, and reveal that three compositors worked onThe Tempest, who are known as Compositor B, C, and F. Compositor B worked onThe Tempest's first page as well as six other pages. He was an experienced journeyman in Jaggard's printshop, who occasionally could be careless. In his role, he may have had a responsibility for the entire First Folio. The other two, Compositors C and F, worked full-time and were experienced printers.[27]

At the time, spelling and punctuation was not standardized and will vary from page to page, because each compositor had their individual preferences and styles. There is evidence that the press run was stopped at least four times, which allowed proofreading and corrections. However, a page with an error would not be discarded, so pages late in any given press run would be the most accurate, and each of the final printed folios may vary in this regard. This is the common practice at the time. There is also an instance of a letter (a metalsortor a type) being damaged (possibly) during the course of a run and changing the meaning of a word: After the masque Ferdinand says,

The word ""wise"" at the end of line 123 was printed with the traditional long ""s"" that resembles an ""f"". But in 1978 it was suggested that during the press run, a small piece of the crossbar on the type had broken off, and the word should be ""wife"". Modern editors have not come to an agreement—Oxford says ""wife"", Arden says ""wise"".[30][31][32]

The Tempestis explicitly concerned with its own nature as a play, frequently drawing links between Prospero's art and theatrical illusion. The shipwreck was a spectacle that Ariel performed.[34]Prospero may even refer to theGlobe Theatrewhen he describes the whole world as an illusion: ""the great globe ... shall dissolve ... like this insubstantial pageant"".[35]Ariel frequently disguises himself as figures fromClassical mythology, for example anymph, aharpy, andCeres, acting as the latter in amasquethat Prospero creates.[36]

The masque inThe Tempestis not itself amasque; rather, it is a dramatisation of a masque, while serving the narrative of the drama that contains it.[37]It is an example of Propsero's magic art: a performance in which Ariel and his fellows play the roles.[38][39]In it, the goddessesIris,CeresandJunocelebrate the betrothal of Miranda and Ferdinand.[40][41]

The language of the masque is stylized and artificial - to the point that some twentieth century critics dispraised it or considered it the work of another writer.[42]

The Tempestas a whole contains elements which are derived from the masque as its leading practitioner,Ben Jonson, was developing it: specifically a masque is a movement from conflict to harmony, asThe Tempestis, and masques centre onantitheses, as seen - for example - in the depiction of Ariel and Caliban as exquisite -v- monstrous, grateful -v- ungrateful orair -v- earth.[43]

The tone of Prospero's speech towards his three enemies Antonio, Alonso and Sebastian throughout the play is of rage and vengeance. However in the final act, Prospero tells Ariel ""They being penitent, the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further.""[44]But as Stephen Orgel notes in his introduction to the Oxford edition of the play, there is a condition in this speech which is not fulfilled: that Antonio is given no speech of remorse or contrition at the end of the play.[45]

Prospero freely forgives Alonso. But in his final speeches towards Antonio, Prospero's attitude vascillates: ""You, brother mine, that entertained ambition ... I do forgive thee""[46]but then immediately reverses himself: ""Unnatural though thou art!""[47]and reconsiders upon remembering the conspiracy to kill Alonso: ""At this time I will tell no tales""[48]then almost reverses himself with: ""Most wicked sir, whom to call brother would even infect my mouth""[49]and only then confirms his forgiveness, while giving Antonio no opportunity to repent: ""I do forgive thy rankest fault - all of them; and require my dukedom of thee, which perforce I know thou must restore.""[50][51]

The spareness of Shakespeare's writing in the last act give scope to the actor playing Prospero to decide whether it was always the intention to forgive his enemies or whether he is influenced by Ariel's advice to be ""tender"",[52]and similarly whether the change is gradual, is sudden, or is forced upon him by shame or expediency.[53]

An important aspect of Prospero's project is to secure his dynasty by marrying his daughter, Miranda, to the heir of Naples, Ferdinand, for whom she is only a suitable bride if she is a virgin.[54][55]Chastity had also become embodied as a royal virtue through the reign ofElizabeth, the ""Virgin Queen"".[54]

Miranda is seen as a sexual object by three characters:

The latter leads to chastity becoming the primary theme of the masque in Act IV, prefixed by Prospero's warning to Ferdinand: ""But if thou dost break her virgin-knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered, no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow.""[58]Venus and Cupid (who, in the mythology, initiated the abduction ofProserpina) are banished from the masque, and the songs of Ceres and Juno[59]celebrate chaste love.[60]

Prospero has been described as practicing ""theurgy"", white magic, known in Shakespeare's time fromneo-Platonicwriters, and contrasted with ""goety"", black magic.[61]ContemporaryDr John Deeregarded himself as practicing this white magic, but all magic was condemned by the church and the state:King Jamesin his bookDaemonologiehaving declared it punishable by death.[62]Early modern plays about magic had portrayed it negatively: most famously inMarlowe'sDoctor Faustus, but also, quite recently at the timeThe Tempestwas written, inJonson's satireThe Alchemist, played by Shakespeare's own company,The King's Men, in which the central magician character, Subtle, is merely a con man.[63]

In another more positive interpretation, Prospero's magic is an extension of science.Francis Bacon(who was at the time King James's Attorney-General) had written in hisMagnalia Naturaeof the possibility of the new philosophy giving humans powers over storms, seasons, germination and harvests.[64]

Prospero often invokes the language ofalchemybut his project is to transform not metals, but people: especially Caliban and Prospero's former enemies Antonio, Sebastian and Alsonso.[65]And he has the signifiers that Elizabethan audiences would have associated with magical power: his books, his staff and his robe.[66]

In the end Prospero must abandon his magic. He must free himself from the temptation to use magic for revenge, and from the distraction from his ducal duties which had caused his fall from power twelve years earlier.[67][68]

Related to Prospero's magic is the contrast between himself and the unseen characterSycorax, Caliban's mother, an Algerian witch who inhabited the island and died prior to Prospero and Miranda's arrival. Prospero himself makes much of the distinction between his own magical skill and that of Sycorax - both in moral terms (his white magic against her black magic) and in terms of his greater powers - exemplified by the fact that Sycorax ""could not again undo""[69]Ariel's imprisonment in a cloven pine and ""It was mine [Prospero's] art ... that made gape the pine and let thee out.""[70][67]

Scholar Stephen Orgel concludes that ""attitudes towards magic in the play ... range from the most positive to the most negative""[68]but that twentieth century criticism emphasised the virtuous aspects of Propspero's magic: citingFrances YatesandFrank Kermodeamong those who praise Propsero's theurgy over the goety of Sycorax.[68]But Orgel goes on to reject this view as an oversimplification: pointing out that there is no evidence that the spirits controlled by Sycorax are any lower than (or, indeed, any other than) those controlled by Prospero, and also that Ariel is the unwilling servant of both.[71]

The moral superiority of Prospero over Sycorax is also undermined in Prospero's speech renouncing his magic[72]which many in Shakespeare's audiences would have known (see ""Sources"" above) was a quotation from the witch Medea in Ovid'sMetamorphoses.[67][73]

Thomas Campbellin 1838 was the first to consider that Prospero was meant to partially represent Shakespeare, but then abandoned that idea when he came to believe thatThe Tempestwas an early play.[74]Even so, the idea has persisted in the critical canon that Prospero may be partly autobiographical.[74][75]

As it was probably Shakespeare's last solo play,The Tempesthas often been seen as a valedictory for his career, especially in the passages beginning ""Our revels now are ended...""[76]and ""Ye elves of hills..."".[77][78]Of the latter, Shakespeare's biographerSamuel Schoenbaumhas suggested that it is more pertinent to Shakespeare than to Prospero, since there is nothing to suggested that at Prospero's command ""Graves ... have wak'd their sleepers, ope'd, and let 'em forth""[79]- something Shakespeare has done, metaphorically, for many an historical character through his works.[80]

And in the epilogue of the play, Prospero enters into a parabasis (a direct address to the audience) in which he tells the audience ""Let your indulgence set me free"".[81]Because Prospero is often identified with Shakespeare himself in this final speech, both appear (in the words of Germaine Greer) to be ""[not] so much bidding farewell to the stage as begging to be released from it"".[82][83][84]

Comedy: The Tempest is listed first among the ""Comedies"" in the 1623First Folioof Shakespeare's works.[85]The plot contains elements deriving from the Italian tradition ofcommedia dell'arte.[86]In Shakespeare's time, whether a work was classified as comedy was chiefly defined by the resolution of its plot: typically one ending in marriage.[87]

Tragicomedy: Although the plot contains similarities to Shakespeare's early comedies, its darker tone has led some twentieth-century critics including Joan Hartwig to label it atragicomedyin the same tradition as contemporary mixed-mode plays such as the collaborations betweenBeaumont and Fletcher.[88]E. M. W. Tillyardargued that the classic principles of tragedy were divided between two of Shakespeare's late plays: destruction being explored more fully inThe Winter's Tale, and regeneration more fully inThe Tempest.[89]

Romance: Four of Shakespeare's late plays -Pericles,Cymbeline,The Winter's TaleandThe Tempest- have become grouped together as hisromances.[90][91]This places them in a tradition derived from third-century Greek narratives, and practiced by Elizabethan writers includingLyly,Lodge,GreeneandSidney.[90]These plays (in the words of Reginald Foakes) ""create a world dominated by chance ... in which we are attuned to delight in and wonder at the unexpected.""[92]

LikeThe Comedy of Errors,The Tempestroughly adheres to theunitiesof time, place, and action.[93]Shakespeare's other plays rarely respected the three unities, taking place in separate locations miles apart and over several days or even years.[94]Of Shakespeare's other late romances, for example,The Winter's Talecontains a gap of sixteen years, andCymbeline'saction veers between Britain and Italy.[95]In contrast,The Tempest'sevents unfold in real time before the audience, taking around three hours.[96][97][95]All action is unified into one basic plot: Prospero's struggle to regain his dukedom; it is also confined to one place, a fictional island.

The action takes place on an enchanted island ruled by Prospero, which must be located in the Mediterranean Sea, since it is encountered by travelers attempting to sail fromTunistoNaples.[98][99]However it is often thought of in subsequent criticism as being in the North Atlantic: partly because of the play's association with the wreck of the Sea Venture (see ""Sources"" above) and Ariel's suggestion of its proximity to the ""still-vexed Bermoothes""[100]both of which relate it toBermuda, but also because of the colonial context of the play - and the way in which it subsequently came to be viewed by postcolonial critics - which suggest a setting in theNew World.[101][102]Also indicative of a New World setting are the name of Sycorax's god,Setebos, which derives from South America, and the source of Gonzalo's Utopia inMontaigne'sessayOf The Cannibals(see also ""Sources"" above).[103]

Throughout the critical history of the play until the mid-twentieth century, Prospero was generally regarded as an admirable figure: ""prickly but essentially lovable"" (in the words of Martin Butler).[104]But in more recent criticism and performance he has come to be seen as self-doubting and controlling and his attitude one of (in Martin Butler's words again) ""suspicion, strain and paranoia"".[105]

This shift in the attitude of critics is partly due to the absence of soliloquies in which Prospero can make his feelings known to the audience. Did he always intend to forgive his enemies, for example, or is his statement that ""the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance""[106]a conclusion he reaches during the currency of the play?[107]But it also reflects changing moral and political assumptions about the nature of rule, and of family.[107]

The Tempestis one of the plays (alongsideThe Merchant of VeniceandOthello) most analysed in aPostcolonialcontext,[108]and indeed is considered to be the work upon which postcolonial studies first took root.[109]The play has become, in the words of Peter Hulme, ""emblematic of the founding years of England's colonialism"".[110]From a postcolonial perspective, Prospero is seen as having imported to the island the social and moral structures of Milan (meaning, for early audiences, of London) by seizing rule, and making slaves of its inhabitants Caliban and Ariel.[111]

Traditionally, it was common to viewThe Tempestas an allegory of artistic creativity, with Prospero as all-knowing and benevolent.[112]Beginning in about 1950, with the publication ofPsychology of ColonizationbyOctave Mannoni, postcolonial theorists have increasingly appropriatedThe Tempestand reinterpreted it in light of postcolonial theory. This new way of looking at the text explored the effect of the ""coloniser"" (Prospero) on the ""colonised"" (Ariel and Caliban). Although Ariel is often overlooked in these debates in favour of the more intriguing Caliban, he is nonetheless an essential component of them.[113]So, in the 1960s and 1970s, Caliban's ""This island's mine... which thou tak'st from me""[114]became a rallying-cry for African and Caribbean intellectuals.[112]

But critics such as Meredith Anne Skura have pointed out the limits of the postcolonial approach, referencing its projection backwards onto a play from the 1610s of historical events which happened later, and stressing the point that, in the story, Prospero does not choose to colonise the island, but runs aground there after being set adrift.[115]

Feminist interpretations ofThe Tempestconsider the play in terms of gender roles and relationships among the characters on stage, and consider how concepts of gender are constructed and presented by the text, and explore the supporting consciousnesses and ideologies, all with an awareness of imbalances and injustices.[116]Two early feminist interpretations ofThe Tempestare included in Anna Jameson'sShakespeare's Heroines(1832) and Mary Clarke'sThe Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines(1851).[117][118]

The Tempestis a play created in a male dominated culture and society, a gender imbalance the play explores metaphorically by having only one major female role, Miranda. Miranda is fifteen, intelligent, naive, and beautiful. The only humans she has ever encountered in her life are male. Prospero sees himself as her primary teacher, and asks if she can remember a time before they arrived to the island—he assumes that she cannot. When Miranda has a memory of ""four or five women"" tending to her younger self (1.2.44–47), it disturbs Prospero, who prefers to portray himself as her only teacher, and the absolute source of her own history—anything before his teachings in Miranda's mind should be a dark ""abysm"", according to him. (1.2.48–50) The ""four or five women"" Miranda remembers may symbolize the young girl's desire for something other than only men.[119][120]

Other women, such as Caliban's motherSycorax, Miranda's mother and Alonso's daughter Claribel, are only mentioned. Because of the small role women play in the story in comparison to other Shakespeare plays,The Tempesthas attracted much feminist criticism. Miranda is typically viewed as being completely deprived of freedom by her father. Her only duty in his eyes is to remain chaste. Ann Thompson argues that Miranda, in a manner typical of women in a colonial atmosphere, has completely internalised the patriarchal order of things, thinking of herself as subordinate to her father.[121]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein,"Victor Frankenstein, son of an upper-classGenevesefamily, spends his youth obsessed withalchemy. As he grows older, he develops an interest in modern sciences such aschemistryandelectricity. After his mother Caroline dies ofscarlet fever, Victor leaves home to attend theUniversity of Ingolstadt. Through his studies, Victor discovers a new way to create life, which he uses to create alarge and grotesque humanoid creature. Whenthe creatureawakens, Victor flees in terror. He returns to find the creature gone.

The newly conscious creature runs away, discovers fire, and learns to avoid humans, who find him frightening. He finds ahovelattached to a small house, which lets him observe a family while remaining unseen. As the family teaches their language to a foreigner, the creature also learns to speak and write. He also finds a collection of books, includingParadise Lost, and learns to read. When he finally reveals himself to the family, they are horrified by his appearance and chase him away. The creature then saves a young girl from drowning, only to be shot by her father, who perceives his rescue as an attack.

Angry at humanity, the creature returns to Geneva to find Victor, and instead meets Victor's brother William. Realizing that William belongs to the same family, the creature kills him, then frames the Frankensteins' servant Justine for his death. Victor suspects his creature was responsible, but does not intervene while Justine is tried and executed. Later, while hiking onMer de Glace, Victor encounters the creature again. The creature relays his story and asks Victor to create a female companion, which he believes will be his only chance at happiness. Victor agrees.

Victor and his friend Henry Clerval leave the European mainland forBritain, where Victor establishes a laboratory inOrkney. While working on the female creature, Victor worries about his creations giving birth, and decides to destroy the incomplete female instead. In retaliation, the original creature murders Henry. Victor suffers a mental breakdown, then returns home. Back in Geneva, Victor marries his childhood friendElizabeth Lavenza, only for the creature to murder her on the wedding night. Days later, Victor's father Alphonse dies of grief. With no remaining family, Victor vows revenge and pursues the creature, eventually following him to theArctic.

Chasing the creature across Arctic ice, Victor nearly dies from exhaustion andhypothermia. He is rescued by Captain Robert Walton, who is leading an expedition to the North Pole. Victor recounts his story to Walton and encourages the crew to continue their expedition; instead, they decide to abandon their journey and turn back. Victor vows to continue chasing the creature, but in his weakened state, he dies aboard the ship. As the ship leaves the Arctic, the creature comes onboard. He mourns Victor's death, tells Walton he plans to burn himself on a pyre, and then departs to build a pyre.

Mary Shelley's mother,Mary Wollstonecraft, died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her. Shelley grew close to her father,William Godwin, having never known her mother. Godwin hired a nurse, who briefly cared for her and her half sister, before marrying his second wifeMary Jane Clairmont, who did not like the close bond between Shelley and her father. The resulting friction caused Godwin to favour his other children.

Shelley's father was a famous author of the time, and her education was of great importance to him, although it was not formal. Shelley grew up surrounded by her father's friends, writers, and persons of political importance, who often gathered at the family home. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Mary, at the age of sixteen, met Percy Bysshe Shelley (who later became her husband) while he was visiting her father. Godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older, married man, so they fled to France along with her stepsister,Claire Clairmont. On 22 February 1815, Shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child, Clara, who died two weeks later.[10]

In thesummer of 1816, Mary, Percy, and Claire took a trip to visit Claire's lover, Lord Byron, inGeneva. Poor weather conditions, more akin to winter, forced Byron and the visitors to stay indoors. To help pass time, Byron suggested that he, Mary, Percy, and Byron's physician,John Polidori, have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors.[11]Mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation ofFrankenstein.[12][13]

Shelley's work was heavily influenced by that of her parents. Her father was famous forEnquiry Concerning Political Justiceand her mother famous forA Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Her father's novels also influenced her writing ofFrankenstein. These novels includedThings as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams,St. Leon, andFleetwood. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting inFrankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear inFrankensteinarePygmalionet Galatéeby Mme de Genlis, andOvid, with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society.[14]Ovid also inspires the use ofPrometheusin Shelley's title.[15]

The influence ofJohn Milton'sParadise LostandSamuel Taylor Coleridge'sThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerare evident in the novel. InThe Frankenstein of the French Revolution, author Julia Douthwaite posits that Shelley probably acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character fromHumphry Davy's bookElements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that,

References to theFrench Revolutionrun through the novel; a likely source isFrançois-Félix Nogaret[fr]'sLe Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant(1790), a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn, who creates a life-sized automaton.[16]

Both Frankenstein and the monster quote passages from Percy Shelley's 1816 poem, ""Mutability"", and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. Percy Shelley's name never appeared as the author of the poem, although the novel credits other quoted poets by name.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" (1798) is associated with the theme of guilt andWilliam Wordsworth's ""Tintern Abbey"" (1798) with that of innocence.

Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then-popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work because of several notable similarities. Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries wereGiovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London,[17]andJohann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

Ideas about life and death discussed by Percy and Byron were of great interest to scientists of that time. They discussed ideas fromErasmus Darwinand the experiments ofLuigi Galvanias well asJames Lind.[18]Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin, Galvani and perhaps Lind were present in her novel.

Shelley's personal experiences also influenced the themes withinFrankenstein. The themes of loss, guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance. In a 1965 issue ofThe Journal of Religion and Healtha psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.[13]

During the rainy summer of 1816, the ""Year Without a Summer"", the world was locked in a long, coldvolcanic wintercaused by the eruption ofMount Tamborain 1815.[19][20]Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and future husband),Percy Bysshe Shelley, visitedLord Byronat theVilla DiodatibyLake Geneva, in Switzerland'sAlps. The weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the bookFantasmagoriana.[21]Byron proposed that they ""each write a ghost story.""[22]Unable to think of a story, Mary Shelley became anxious. She recalled being asked ""Have you thought of a story?"" each morning, and every time being ""forced to reply with a mortifying negative.""[23]During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. ""Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated,"" Mary noted, ""galvanismhad given token of such things"".[24]It was after midnight before they retired and, unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the ""grim terrors"" of her ""waking dream"".[6]

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa in the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her ""waking dream"" took place between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.[26]

Mary Shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a fully-fledged novel.[27]She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment ""when I first stepped out from childhood into life.""[28]Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[29]This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composingFrankensteinin 1816, she was probably nursing her second child, who was also dead by the time ofFrankenstein's publication.[30]Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre ofBathin 1816.[31]

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on thevampirelegends he heard while travelling theBalkans, and from thisJohn PolidoricreatedThe Vampyre(1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.[32][33][34]

The group talked aboutEnlightenmentandCounter-Enlightenmentideas as well. Mary Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society.[35]

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as thefair copyfor her publisher, are now housed in theBodleian LibraryinOxford.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/121,Northanger Abbey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northanger_Abbey,"Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. Although atomboyin her childhood, she is ""in training for a heroine""[9]and is fond of readingGothic novels""provided they [are] all story and no reflection.""[10]

The Allens (her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton) invite Catherine to accompany them in their visit to the city ofBathand partake in the winterseasonof balls, theatre and other social activities. Shortly after their arrival, she is introduced to a young gentleman,Henry Tilney, with whom she dances. Mrs. Allen meets an old school friend, Mrs. Thorpe, whose daughter, Isabella, quickly becomes friends with Catherine. Isabella introduces Catherine toAnn Radcliffe's 1794 Gothic novelMysteries of Udolpho. Mrs. Thorpe's son, John, is a friend of Catherine's older brother, James, at Oxford University where they are both students. The two young men come to Bath, where John is then introduced to Catherine.

The Thorpes are not happy about Catherine's friendship with the Tilneys. They correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine's affections even though Catherine is not at all interested in John Thorpe. Despite Thorpe continually attempting to sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys, Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys. This leads to several misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the Tilneys.

Isabella and James become engaged. James' father approves of the match andoffers his son a country parson's livingof a modest sum, £400 annually, but they must wait until he can obtain thebeneficein two and a half years. Isabella is dissatisfied, but to Catherine, she misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay, and not by the value of the sum. Isabella immediately begins to flirt with Captain Frederick Tilney, Henry's older brother. Innocent Catherine cannot understand her friend's behaviour, but Henry understands all too well as he knows his brother's character and habits.

The Tilneys invite Catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their home, Northanger Abbey. Once at Northanger Abbey, Catherine and Eleanor Tilney, Henry's and Frederick's younger sister, get to know each other better on a personal level.[11]Catherine, in accordance with her novel reading, expects the house to be exotic and frightening. Henry teases her about this as it turns out that Northanger Abbey is pleasant and decidedly not Gothic. However, the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters; Catherine learns that they were the apartments of Mrs. Tilney, who died nine years earlier due to a serious illness,[11]leaving Mr. Tilney with three children to raise by himself.[12]As General Tilney no longer appears to be affected by her death, Catherine decides that he may have imprisoned her in her chamber, or even murdered her.

Catherine discovers that her over-active imagination has led her astray as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments. Henry finds and questions her; he surmises and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death.[13]She leaves the apartments, crying, fearing that she has lost Henry's regard entirely. Realising how foolish she has been, Catherine comes to believe that, though novels may be delightful, their content does not relate to everyday life. Henry does not mention this incident to her again.

James writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to Isabella and implies that she has become engaged instead to Captain Tilney. Henry and Eleanor Tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually become engaged to Isabella Thorpe. Catherine is terribly disappointed, realising what a dishonest person Isabella is. A subsequent letter from Isabella herself confirms the Tilney siblings' doubts and shows that Frederick Tilney was merely flirting with Isabella. The General goes off to London, and the atmosphere at Northanger Abbey immediately becomes lighter and more pleasant from his absence. Catherine passes several enjoyable days with Henry and Eleanor until the General returns abruptly in a temper in Henry's absence. He forces Catherine to go home early the next morning in a shocking and unsafe mode that forces Catherine to undertake the 70 miles (110 km) journey alone.

At home, Catherine is listless and unhappy. Henry pays a sudden unexpected visit and explains what happened. General Tilney (on the misinformation of John Thorpe) had believed her to be exceedingly rich as the Allens' prospective heiress, and therefore a proper match for Henry. In London, General Tilney ran into Thorpe again, who, angry at Catherine's refusal of his earlier half-made proposal of marriage, said instead that she was nearly destitute. Enraged, General Tilney, (again on the misinformation of John Thorpe), returned home to evict Catherine. When Henry returned to Northanger, his father informed him of what had occurred and forbade him to think of Catherine again. When Henry learns how she had been treated, he breaks with his father and tells Catherine he still wants to marry her despite his father's disapproval. Catherine is delighted, though when Henry seeks her parents' approval, they tell the young couple that final approval will only happen when General Tilney consents.

Eventually, General Tilney acquiesces because Eleanor has become engaged to a wealthy and titled man; he discovers that the Morlands, while not extremely rich, are far from destitute.

According to notes written by Austen's sister Cassandra after Jane's death in 1817, the novel was finished by 1798 or 1799.[14]The close resemblance in style to Austen's ""juvenilia"" of the early 1790s together with several in-jokes that only the Austen family could have appreciated strongly suggests that the book was begun during that period, probably about 1794.[14]However, the references to several Gothic novels published after 1794 would indicate Austen did not finish the book until about 1798 or 1799 as Cassandra Austen remembered.[15]The scholar Cecil Emden argued that differences between the Catherine portrayed in the Bath section of the novel vs. the Catherine at Northanger Abbey were due to Austen finishing the book at a different stage of her life than when she started.[16]

Austen initially sold the novel, then titledSusan, for £10 to a London bookseller, Crosby & Co. in 1803. This publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript.[2]Austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them, but Crosby & Co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text.[6]In the spring of 1816, the bookseller sold it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the same sum as they had paid for it. There is evidence that Austen further revised the novel in 1816–1817 with the intention of having it published. She rewrote sections, renaming the main character Catherine and using that as her working title.

After her death, Austen's brother Henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication ofNorthanger Abbeyin late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes of a four-volume set, with a preface for the first time publicly identifying Jane Austen as the author of all her novels. NeitherNorthanger AbbeynorPersuasionwas published under the working title Jane Austen used. Aside from first being published together, the two novels are not connected; later editions were published separately."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308,Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Men_in_a_Boat,"The story begins by introducing George, Harris, Jerome (always referred to as ""J.""), and Jerome's dog, Montmorency. The men are spending an evening in J.'s room, smoking and discussing illnesses from which they fancy they suffer. They conclude that they are all suffering from ""overwork"", and need a holiday. A stay in the country and a sea trip are both considered. The country stay is rejected because Harris claims that it would be dull, and the sea-trip after J. describes bad experiences his brother-in-law and a friend had on previous sea-trips. The three eventually decide on a boating holiday up theRiver Thames, from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford, during which they will camp, notwithstanding more of J.'s anecdotes about previous mishaps with tents and camping stoves.

They set off the following Saturday. George must go to work that morning, so J. and Harris make their way to Kingston by train. They cannot find the right train atWaterloo station(the station's confusing layout was a well-known theme of Victorian comedy) so they bribe a train driver to take his train to Kingston, where they collect the hired boat and start the journey. They meet George further up-river atWeybridge.

The remainder of the story describes their river journey and the incidents that occur. The book's original purpose as a guidebook is apparent as J., the narrator, describes passing landmarks and villages such asHampton Court Palace,Hampton Church,Magna Carta IslandandMonkey Island, and muses on historical associations of these places. However, he frequently digresses into humorous anecdotes that range from the unreliability ofbarometersfor weather forecasting to the difficulties encountered when learning to play theScottish bagpipes. The most frequent topics of J.'s anecdotes are river pastimes such as fishing and boating and the difficulties they present to the inexperienced and unwary and to the three men on previous boating trips.

The book includes classic comedy set pieces, such as thePlaster of Paristrout in chapter 17, and the ""Irish stew"" in chapter 14 – made by mixing most of the leftovers in the party's foodhamper:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7700,Lysistrata,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata,"The play begins with these lines spoken by theAthenianLysistrata and her friend Calonice.[3]Women, as represented by Calonice, are sly hedonists in need of firm guidance and direction. In contrast, Lysistrata is portrayed to be an extraordinary woman with a large sense of individual and social responsibility. She has convened a meeting of women from variousGreek city-statesthat are at war with each other. Soon after she confides in her friend her concerns for the female sex, the women begin arriving.

With support from theSpartanLampito, Lysistrata persuades the other women to withhold sexual privileges from their menfolk as a means of forcing them to conclude thePeloponnesian War. The women are reluctant, but the deal is sealed with a solemn oath around a wine bowl in which the women abjure all their sexual pleasures, including the ""lioness on the cheese-grater"".[6]

Soon after the oath is finished, a cry of triumph is heard from the nearbyAcropolis—the old women of Athens have seized control of it at Lysistrata's instigation, since it holds the state treasury, without which the men cannot long continue to fund their war. Lampito goes off to spread the word of revolt, and the other women retreat behind the barred gates of the Acropolis to await the men's response.

A Chorus of Old Men arrives, planning on burning down the gate of theAcropolisif the women do not open up. They are still making preparations to assault the gate when a Chorus of Old Women arrives, bearing pitchers of water. The Old Women complain about the difficulty they had getting the water, but they are ready for a fight in defence of their younger comrades. Threats are exchanged, and the Old Men are defeated with the water.

The magistrate then arrives with someScythian Archers(the Athenian version of police constables). He reflects on the nature of women, their devotion to wine,promiscuous sex, and exotic cults (such as toSabaziusandAdonis), but above all he blames men for poor supervision of their womenfolk. He has come for silver from the state treasury to buy oars for the fleet and he instructs his Scythians to begin levering open the gate. However, they are quickly overwhelmed by groups of women with long names.[7]

Lysistrata restores order and allows the magistrate to question her. She explains the frustrations that women feel at a time of war when the men make decisions that affect everyone, and further complains that their wives' opinions are not listened to. She drapes her headdress over him, gives him a basket of wool and tells him that war will be a woman's business from now on. She then explains the pity she feels for young, childless women, aging at home while the men are away on endless campaigns. When the magistrate points out that men also age, she reminds him that men can marry at any age whereas a woman has only a short time before she is considered too old. She then dresses the magistrate like a corpse for laying out, with a wreath and a fillet, and advises him that he's dead. The magistrate storms off to report the incident to his colleagues, while Lysistrata returns to the Acropolis.

The debate is continued between the Chorus of Old Men and the Chorus of Old Women until Lysistrata returns to the stage with the news that her comrades are desperate for sex and they are beginning to desert on the silliest pretexts (for example, one woman says she has to go home to air her fabrics by spreading them on the bed). After rallying her comrades and restoring their discipline, Lysistrata again returns to the Acropolis to continue waiting for the men's surrender.

A man suddenly appears, desperate for sex. It is Kinesias, the husband of Myrrhine. Lysistrata instructs her to torture him. Myrrhine informs Kinesias that she will have sex with him but only if he promises to end the war. He promptly agrees to these terms and the young couple prepares for sex on the spot. Myrrhine fetches a bed, a mattress, a pillow, a blanket, and a flask of oil, and after delaying the act for some time, locks herself in the Acropolis once more.

A Spartan herald then appears with a large burden (an erection) scarcely hidden inside his tunic and he requests to see the ruling council to arrange peace talks. The magistrate laughs at the herald's situation, but agrees that peace talks should begin.

They go off to fetch the delegates. While they are gone, the Old Women make overtures to the Old Men. The two Choruses merge, singing and dancing in unison. Peace talks commence and Lysistrata introduces the Spartan and Athenian delegates to a woman called Reconciliation. The delegates cannot take their eyes off the woman; meanwhile, Lysistrata scolds both sides for past errors of judgment. The delegates briefly squabble over the peace terms, but with Reconciliation before them, they overcome their differences and retire to the Acropolis for celebrations. The war is ended.

Some events that are significant for understanding the play:[citation needed]

Old Comedy was a topical genre and the playwright expected his audience to be familiar with local identities and issues. The following list of identities mentioned in the play gives some indication of the difficulty faced by any producer trying to stageLysistratafor modern audiences:[citation needed]

Pellene was also the name of a Peloponnesian town resisting Spartan pressure to contribute to naval operations against Athens at this time. It was mentioned earlier in theBirds.[44]

Lysistratabelongs to the middle period of Aristophanes's career when he was beginning to diverge significantly from theconventions of Old Comedy. Such variations from convention include:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/113,The Secret Garden,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden,"At the turn of the 20th century, Mary Lennox is a neglected and unloved 10-year-old girl, born inBritish Indiato wealthy British parents. She is cared for primarily by native servants, who spoil her and allow her to have free rein. After acholeraepidemic kills her parents, Mary is left alone when the few surviving servants flee.

Mary is discovered by British soldiers who place her in the care of an English clergyman, whose children taunt her by calling her ""Mistress Mary, quite contrary"". She is sent to England to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, husband of her father's sister Lilias. He lives on theYorkshire Moorsin a largecountry house, Misselthwaite Manor. On arrival, Mary discovers that Lilias  is dead and that Archibald is ahunchback.

At first, Mary remains angry and defiant. She dislikes her new home, the people living in it and, most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. Over time, she becomes less cantankerous. She befriends her maid, Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about Lilias, who would spend hours in a privatewalled gardengrowing roses. Lilias died after an accident in the garden ten years previously, and the devastated Archibald locked the garden and buried the key.

Mary becomes interested in finding the secret garden herself, and her manners begin to soften as a result. Soon, she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendlyrobin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve.

The robin draws Mary's attention to an area of disturbed soil. Here she finds the key to the locked garden. After her first day exploring, she asks Martha for garden tools, which Martha sends with Dickon, her 12-year-old brother, who spends most of his time out on the moors. Mary and Dickon take a liking to each other. Eager to absorb his gardening knowledge, Mary tells him about the secret garden.

One night, Mary follows mysterious cries that echo through the house. She is startled to find a boy of her own age, Colin, living in a hidden bedroom. She discovers that they are cousins, Colin being the son of Archibald Craven. Colin suffers from fevers and is confined to bed, believed unable to walk. Like Mary, he has grown very spoiled, with servants obeying his every whim in order to prevent his hysterical temper tantrums. Mary visits Colin every day that week, distracting him from his troubles and despondency with stories of the moor, Dickon, and the secret garden. She eventually confides to Colin that she has access to the secret garden, and he asks to see it. Colin is put into his wheelchair and brought outside, the first time he has been outdoors for several years.

In the garden, the children are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled to see the children, he admits that he believed Colin to be ""a cripple,"" with a crooked back and crooked legs. Furious at Ben's comments, Colin rises shakily from his chair and finds that he can stand, although his legs are weak from long disuse. Mary and Dickon spend almost every day in the garden with Colin, and encourage him to attempt walking. Gradually, Colin finds renewed hope for his future. Together, the children and Ben conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret from the other staff, hoping to surprise his father who is travelling abroad.

As his son's health has improved, Archibald has been experiencing an improvement in his own spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Dickon and Martha's mother, advising him to return to Misselthwaite, he takes the opportunity to come home. Walking around the garden wall, he is startled to hear voices inside. He finds the door unlocked, and is astonished to see the garden in full bloom and his son restored to health, having just won a race against Mary. The children tell their story, explaining the restoration of both the garden and Colin. Archibald and his son walk back to the manor together, to the amazement of the servants.

In his analysis of the narrative structures of ""the traditional novel for girls"", Perry Nodelman highlights Mary Lennox as a departure from the narrative pattern of the ""spontaneous and ebullient"" orphan girl who changes her new home and family for the better, since those qualities appear later on in the narrative. The revival of the family and the home in these novels, according to Nodelman, ""is carried to the extreme inThe Secret Garden,"" in which the garden's restoration and the arrival of spring parallel the emergence of human characters from the home, ""almost as if they had been hibernating"".[5]Joe Sutliff Sanders examines Mary andThe Secret Gardenwithin the context of the Victorian and Edwardian cultural debate over affective discipline, which was echoed in contemporary books about orphan girls. He suggests thatThe Secret Gardenwas interested in showing the benefits of affective discipline for men and boys, namely Colin who learns from Mary, understood as ""the novel's representative of girlhood"" and how to wield his ""masculine privilege"".[6]

The titular garden has been the subject of much scholarly discussion. Phyllis Bixler Koppes writes thatThe Secret Gardenmakes use of thefairy tale, theexemplum, and thepastoralliterary genres, which lends the novel a deeper ""thematic development and symbolic resonance"" than Burnett's earlier children's novels which only used elements from the first two traditions.[7]She describes the garden as ""the centralgeorgictrope, the unifying symbol of rebirth in Burnett's novel"".[8]Madelon S. Gohlke understands the titular garden as ""both the scene of a tragedy, resulting in the near destruction of a family"", as well as the site of its regeneration and restoration.[9]

Alexandra Valint suggests that most of the novel's depictions of disability coincide with the stereotypical view of people with disabilities as unhappy, helpless, and less independent than people without disabilities. Colin's use of a wheelchair would have been understood by Edwardian readers as a marker of both disability and social status.[10]

Elizabeth Lennox Keyser writes thatThe Secret Gardenis ambivalent about sex roles: while Mary restores the garden and saves the family, her role in the story is overshadowed at the conclusion of the novel by the return of Colin and his father, which may be seen as a defense of patriarchal authority.[11]Danielle E. Price notes that the novel deals with ""the thorny issues of sex, class, and imperialism"".[12]She writes how Mary's development in the novel parallels ""the steps of nineteenth-century garden theorists in their plans for the perfect garden"", with Mary ultimately turning into ""a girl who, like the ideal garden, can provide both beauty and comfort, and who can cultivate her male cousin, the young patriarch-in-training"".[12]

At the time Burnett began working onThe Secret Garden, she had already established a literary reputation as a writer of children's fiction andsocial realistadult fiction.[13]She had started writing children's fiction in the 1880s, with her most notable book at the time being hersentimentalnovelLittle Lord Fauntleroy(1886).[14]Little Lord Fauntleroywas a ""literary sensation"" in both the United States and Europe, and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.[13]Prior toThe Secret Garden, she had also written another notable work of children's fiction,A Little Princess(1905), which had begun as a story published in the American children's magazineSt. Nicholas Magazinein 1887 and was later adapted as a play in 1902.[15]

Little is known about the literary development and conception ofThe Secret Garden.[16]Biographers and other scholars have been able to glean the details of Burnett's process and thoughts on her other books through her letters to family members; during the time she was working onThe Secret Garden, however, she was living near to them and thus did not need to send them letters.[16]Burnett started the novel in spring 1909, as she was making plans for the garden at her home inPlandomeonLong Island.[17]In an October 1910 letter toWilliam Heinemann, her publisher in England, she described the story, whose working title wasMistress Mary, as ""an innocent thriller of a story"" that she considered ""one of [her] best finds"".[18]Biographer Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina offers several explanations as to why there is so little surviving information on the book's development. Firstly, Burnett's health faltered after moving to her home in Plandome, and her social excursions became limited as a result. Secondly, her existing notes aboutThe Secret Garden, along with a portrait of her and some photographs, were donated by her son Vivian after her death to a lower Manhattan public school serving the deaf in remembrance of her visit there years previously, but all the items soon vanished from the archive of the school. Lastly, a few weeks before the novel's publication, her brother-in-law died in a collision with a trolley, an event that likely darkened the novel's publication.[19]

Burnett's storyMy Robin, however, offers a glimpse of the creation ofThe Secret Garden.[20]In it, she addresses a reader's question on the literary origins of the robin that appears inThe Secret Garden, whom the reader felt ""could not have been a mere creature of fantasy"".[21]Burnett reminisces on her friendship with the real-life English robin, whom she described as ""aperson—not a mere bird"" and who often kept her company in the rose garden where she would often write, when she lived at Maytham Hall.[21]Recounting the first time she tried to communicate with the bird via ""low, soft, little sounds"", she writes that she ""knew—years later—that this is what Mistress Mary thought when she bent down in the Long Walk and 'tried to make robin sounds'"".[22]

Maytham Hallin Kent, England, where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.[23]Biographer Ann Thwaite writes that while the rose garden at Mayham Hall may have been ""crucial"" to the novel's development, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different.[23]Thwaite suggests that, for the setting ofThe Secret Garden, Burnett may have been inspired by the moors ofEmily Brontë's 1847 novelWuthering Heights, given that Burnett only went once toYorkshire, toFryston Hall.[24]She writes that Burnett may have also taken inspiration fromCharlotte Brontë's 1847 novelJane Eyre, noting parallels between the two narratives: both of them, for example, feature orphans sent to ""mysterious mansions"", whose master is largely absent.[25]Burnett herself was aware of the similarities, remarking in a letter thatElla Hepworth Dixonhad described it as a children's version ofJane Eyre.[18]

Scholar Gretchen V. Rector has examined the author's manuscript ofThe Secret Garden, which she describes as ""the only record of the novel's development"".[26]Eighty of the first hundred pages of the manuscript are written in black ink, while the rest and subsequent revisions were made in pencil; the spelling and punctuation tend to follow theAmerican standard. Chapter headings were included prior to the novel's serialization and are not present in the manuscript, with chapters in it delineated by numbers only.[27]The pagination of the manuscript was likely done by a second person: it goes from 1 to 234, only to restart at the nineteenth chapter.[27]From the title page, Rector surmises that the novel's first title wasMary, Mary quite Contrary, later changed to its working title ofMistress Mary.[26]Mary herself is originally nine in the manuscript, only to be aged up a year in a revision, perhaps to highlight the ""convergent paths"" of Mary, Colin, and the garden itself; however, this revision was not reflected in either the British or the American first editions of the novel, or in later editions.[28]Susan Sowerby is initially introduced to the readers as a deceased character, with her daughter Martha perhaps intended to fill her role in the story; Burnett, however, changed her mind about Susan Sowerby, writing her as a living character a few pages later and crossing out the announcement of her death.[29]Additionally, Dickon in the manuscript was physically disabled and used crutches to move around, perhaps drawing on Burnett's recollections of her first husband, Dr. Swan Burnett, and his physical disability. Burnett later removed references to Dickon's disability.[30]

The Secret Gardenmay be one of the first instances of a story for children first appearing in a magazine with an adult readership,[31]an occasion of which Burnett herself was aware at the time.[18]The Secret Gardenwas first published in ten issues (November 1910 – August 1911) ofThe American Magazine, with illustrations by J. Scott Williams.[32]It was first published in book form in August 1911 by theFrederick A. StokesCompany in New York;[33]it was also published that year byWilliam Heinemannin London, illustrated byCharles Robinson. Itscopyrightexpired in the US in 1986,[34]and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in thepublic domain. As a result, several abridged and unabridged editions were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as a full-colour illustrated edition fromDavid R. Godine, Publisherin 1989.

Inga Moore's abridged edition of 2008, illustrated by her, is arranged so that a line of the text also serves as a caption to a picture.

Upon its publication in novel format,The Secret Gardengarnered largely warm reviews from literary critics,[35][36]and sold well, with a second printing announced within a month after the novel's release.[37]In general, it was seen as an enjoyable novel, and was reviewed within the context of Burnett's previous works, includingLittle Lord Fauntleroy.[38]It sold well during the 1911 Christmas season, becoming a bestseller in the fiction category, and placing on critical ""best of"" lists, including that of theLiterary DigestandThe New York Times.[39]Its literary debut in a magazine for adults led the public to understand it as adult fiction; the book was marketed accordingly, ""with some overlap in the juvenile market"", which affected its reception by the public.[40]Of this time, scholar Anne Lundin writes that ""The Secret Gardenstruggled to assert its own identity as a different kind of story that spoke to both the romanticism and modernism of a new century"".[40]Burnett regardedThe Secret Gardenas her favorite novel, although she considered one of her novels for adults,In Connection with the DeWilloughby Claim, to be herGreat American Novel.[41]

Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Lundin notes that the author's obituary notices all remarked onLittle Lord Fauntleroyand passed overThe Secret Gardenin silence.[42]Burnett's literary reputation waned over the following decades, possibly as a result of biases towards books that garner a female audience.[43]Despite being largely overlooked by literary critics and librarians,[44]The Secret Gardenenjoyed a considerable following among its readers.[35]It continued to rank well on readers' polls for favorite stories. In 1927, it placed in the top fifteen favorite books of femaleYouth Companionreaders, and in the 1960s, the readers ofThe New York TimesrankedThe Secret Gardenas one of the best children's books. Surveys of adult readers in the 1970s and 1980s show that the novel was a frequent childhood favorite, especially for women.[45]

Burnett's literary reputation underwent a critical resurgence in the 1950s.Marghanita Laski'sMrs Ewing, Mrs Molesworth and Mrs Hodgson Burnett(1951) describedThe Secret Garden,A Little Princess, andLittle Lord Fauntleroyas the best of Burnett's children's books; Laski consideredThe Secret Gardento be the best of the three, with a capacity to reach thoughtful and self-reflective children.[43]Other British literary critics and historians began to take note of the novel, includingRoger Lancelyn GreenandJohn Rowe Townsend.[46]Thwaite's biography about Burnett,Waiting for the Party(1974), highlightedThe Secret Gardenfor its depiction of unpleasant children that she felt was much closer to contemporary ideas about how children behave.[47]At the time that Thwaite's biography was published, children's literature was becoming a field of greater scholarly interest, and as a result,The Secret Gardenbegan to garner more scholarly analysis.[48]The Secret Gardenbecame accepted as part of the scholarlycanonof children's literature in the 1980s.[48]

In the twentieth-first century,The Secret Gardencontinues to be well regarded among readers. In 2003 it ranked No. 51 inThe Big Read, a survey of the British public by theBBCto identify the ""Nation's Best-loved Novel"" (not just children's novel).[49]Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted it as one of ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[50][51]In 2012, it was ranked No. 15 among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal, a monthly with a primarily US audience.[52]A Little Princesswas ranked number 56 andLittle Lord Fauntleroydid not make the Top 100.[52]Jeffrey MassonconsidersThe Secret Garden""one of the greatest books ever written for children"".[53]In an oblique compliment,Barbara Sleighhas her title character readingThe Secret Gardenon the train at the beginning of her children's novelJessamyandRoald Dahl, in his children's bookMatilda, has his title character say that she likedThe Secret Gardenbest of all the children's books in the library.[54]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25305,Memoirs of Fanny Hill,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill,"The novel consists of two long letters (which appear as volumes I and II of the original edition) to an unnamed acquaintance identified only as 'Madam,' written by Frances 'Fanny' Hill,  a rich Englishwoman in her middle age, who leads a life of contentment with her loving husband Charles and their children. Fanny has been prevailed upon by 'Madam' to recount the 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with 'stark naked truth' as her governing principle.

The first letter begins with a short account of Fanny's impoverished childhood in aLancashirevillage. At age 14, she loses her parents tosmallpox, arrives inLondonto look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel. She sees a sexual encounter between an ugly older couple and another between a young attractive couple, and participates in a lesbian encounter of masturbation with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitute. A customer, Charles, meets Fanny and the two fall in love at first sight, leading to Charles persuading her to escape, while paying a sum of money to secure Fanny's escape. She loses her virginity to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by desperation and poverty to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H—. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she sees Mr H— have a sexual encounter with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H—) as an act of revenge. She is discovered by Mr H— as she is having a sexual encounter with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H—, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks the end of the first letter.

The second letter begins with a rumination on the tedium of writing about sex and the difficulty of driving a middle course between vulgar language and ""mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions"". Fanny then describes her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole, which include a group orgy, an elaborately orchestrated bogus sale of her ""virginity"" to a rich dupe called Mr Norbert, and a sado-masochistic session with a man involving mutual flagellation with birch-rods. These are interspersed with narratives which do not involve Fanny directly; for instance, the three other girls in Mrs Cole's house (Emily, Louisa and Harriett) describe their own losses of virginity, and the nymphomaniac Louisa seduces the immensely endowed but imbecilic ""good-natured Dick"". Fanny also describes anal intercourse between two older boys (removed from several later editions). Eventually Fanny retires from prostitution and becomes the lover of a rich and worldly-wise man of 60, after coming to his aid during a fit of coughing whilst out for a morning walk. (The elder man is described by Fanny as a ""rational pleasurist""). This phase of Fanny's life brings about her intellectual development, and leaves her wealthy when her lover dies of a sudden cold. Soon after, she has a chance encounter with Charles, who has returned as a poor man to England after being shipwrecked. Fanny offers her fortune to Charles unconditionally, but he insists on marrying her.

The novel's developed characters include Charles, Mrs Jones (Fanny's landlady), Mrs Cole, Will, Mr H— and Mr Norbert. The prose includes long sentences with many subordinate clauses. Its morality is conventional for the time, in that it denounces sodomy, frowns upon vice and approves of only heterosexual unions based upon mutual love.[21]

The plot was described as 'operatic' byJohn Hollander, who said that ""the book's language and its protagonist's character are its greatest virtues"".[22]

Literary criticFelicity A. Nussbaumdescribes the girls in Mrs Cole's brothel as""'a little troop of love' who provide compliments, caresses, and congratulation to their fellow whores' erotic achievements"".[23]

According to literary critic Thomas Holmes, Fanny and Mrs Cole see the homosexual act thus: ""the act subverts not only the hierarchy of the male over the female, but also what they consider nature's law regarding the role of intercourse and procreation"".[24]

There are numerous scholars who claim thatFannyin her name refers to a woman'svulva, or thatHillrefers to themons pubis, mound of Venus.[25]However, this interpretation lacks corroborating evidence: the term ""fanny"" is first known to have been used to mean female genitalia in the 1830s, and no 18th-century dictionary defines ""fanny"" in this way.[26]

Later in the text when Fanny is with Louisa, they come across a boy nicknamed ""Good-natured Dick"" who is described as having some mental disability/handicap. Louisa brings the boy in anyway, as Dick's functioning physical state supersedes his poor mental one. This scene also leads into an issue within the text of rape (for both Dick and Louisa) and how the possible label of rape is removed by resistance transitioning into pleasure.[27]

One scholar, David McCracken, writes aboutFanny Hillas abildungsroman. Her sexual development contains three life stages: innocence, experimentation, and experience.[28]McCracken specifically addresses how Fanny's word selections on describing the phallus change throughout the stages. Fanny sees the phallus as both an object of terror and of delight. McCracken relates her changing view of the phallus to Burke's theory of the sublime and beautiful.

Patricia Spacksdiscusses how Fanny has been previously deprived by her rural environment of what she can understand as real experience, and how she welcomes the whores' efforts to educate her.[29]Since Fanny is so quickly catapulted into her new life, she has had little time to reflect on the shame and regret that she feels for leading a life of adultery, and replaces this shame with the pleasure of sexual encounters with men and women. Even though these feelings may have been replaced or forgotten, she still reflects on her past: ""...and since I was now bent over the bar, I thought by plunging over head and ears into the stream I was hurried away by, to drown all sense of shame or reflection"".[30]Having little time to think about how she feels about her transition, she masks her thoughts with sexual pleasure, yet this is not a total fix to forget her emotions.

Andrea Haslanger argues in her dissertation how the use of first-person narrative in the 18th century ""undermines, rather than secures, the individual"" in classic epistolary novels likeRoxanabyDaniel Defoe,EvelinabyFanny Burney,FrankensteinbyMary Shelleyand specificallyFanny Hill. Haslanger claims that ""the paradox of pornographic narration is that it mobilizes certain aspects of the first person (the description of intimate details) while eradicating others (the expression of disagreement or resistance)"" (19).[31]With this in mind, she raises the question of ""whether 'I' denotes consciousness or body or both"" (34).

With sexual acts being viewed as taboo within 18th-century England,Fanny Hillstrayed far away from the norm in comparison to other works of its time. A large portion of books that focused on the idea of sex were written in the form of conduct novels: books that would focus on teaching women the proper ways to behave and live their lives in as virtuous a manner as possible.[32]These novels encouraged women to stay away from sexual deviance, for if they were to remain virtuous then they would ultimately be rewarded. One example of this isSamuel Richardson's conduct novelPamela; or, Virtue Rewarded, in which the character of Pamela is able to resist sexual temptation, thus maintaining her virtue and being rewarded in the end with a prosperous life.

However,Fanny Hillwas widely considered to be the first work of its time to focus on the idea of sexual deviance being an act of pleasure, rather than something that was simply shameful. This can be seen through Fanny's character partaking in acts that would normally be viewed as deplorable by society's standards, but then is never punished for them. In fact, Fanny is ultimately able to achieve her own happy ending when she is able to find Charles again, marrying him and living in a life of wealth. This can be viewed in sharp contrast to a work likePamela, where sexual acts are avoided for the sake of maintaining virtue. Meanwhile, withinFanny Hill, normally deplorable acts can be conducted with little to no consequence.[citation needed]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209,The Turn of the Screw,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw,"OnChristmas Eve, an unnamed narrator and some of his friends are gathered around a fire. One of them, Douglas, reads a manuscript written by his sister's late governess. The manuscript tells the story of her being hired by a man who has become responsible for his young niece and nephew following the deaths of their parents. He lives mainly in London and has a country house in Bly,Essex.

The boy, Miles, is attending a boarding school, while his younger sister, Flora, is living in Bly, where she is cared for by Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper. Flora's uncle, the governess's new employer, is uninterested in raising the children and gives her full charge, explicitly stating that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort.  The governess travels to Bly and begins her duties.

Miles returns from school for the summer just after a letter arrives from the headmaster, informing his caretakers that he has been expelled. Miles never speaks of the matter, and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue. She fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion, but is too charmed by the boy to want to press the issue.

Soon after, around the grounds of the estate, the governess begins to see the figures of a man and woman whom she does not recognize. The figures come and go at will without being seen or challenged by other members of the household, and they seem to the governess to be supernatural. She learns from Mrs. Grose that the governess's predecessor, Miss Jessel, and another employee, Peter Quint, had had a close relationship. Before their deaths, Jessel and Quint spent much of their time with Flora and Miles, and the governess becomes convinced that the two children are aware of the ghosts' presence and influenced by them.

Without permission, Flora leaves the house while Miles is playing music for the governess. The governess notices Flora's absence and goes with Mrs. Grose in search of her. They find her on the shore of a nearby lake, and the governess is convinced that Flora has been talking to the ghost of Miss Jessel. The governess sees Miss Jessel and believes Flora sees her as well, but Mrs. Grose does not. Flora denies seeing Miss Jessel and begins to insist that she will not see the new governess again.

The governess decides that Mrs. Grose should take Flora away to her uncle in attempt to escape Miss Jessel's influence. Left alone with the governess, Miles at last confesses he was expelled for something he said but cannot remember what he said or to whom he said it. The ghost of Quint appears to the governess at the window. The governess shields Miles, who attempts to see the ghost. The governess insists to Miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost, only to find that Miles has died in her arms.

As a piece of Gothic fiction, critics highlight the influence ofCharlotte Brontë'sJane Eyre(1847) on the novella.The Turn of the Screwborrows both fromJane Eyre's themes ofclassand gender,[1]and from its mid-nineteenth-century setting.[2]The novella alludes toJane Eyrein tandem with an explicit reference toAnn Radcliffe's Gothic novelThe Mysteries of Udolpho(1794), wherein the governess wonders if there might be a secret relative hidden in the attic at Bly.[3]One critic writes that the only ""definite event"" in the novel that does not ""belong"" in Gothic fantasy is Miles' expulsion from school.[4]

Although the influence of the Gothic on the novella is clear, it cannot only be characterised as one. James' ghosts differ from those of traditional Gothic tales – frightening, often bound in chains – by appearing like their living selves.[5]Similarly, the novella foregoes major devices associated with Gothic novels, such as digressions, as inFrankenstein(1818) andDracula(1897), instead relating one whole, continuous narrative.[6]

For the story's publication inCollier's Weekly, James was contracted to write a ghost story.[7]As a result, some critics have regarded it in that tradition. L. Andrew Cooper observed thatThe Turn of the Screwmight be the best-known example of a ghost story which exploits the ambiguity of afirst-person narrative.[8]Citing James' reference to the work as his ""designed horror"", Donald P. Costello suggested that the effect of a given scene varies depending on who represents the action. In scenes where the governess directly reports on what she sees, the effect is horror, but in those where she merely comments, the effect is ""mystification"".[9]In his 1983 nonfiction survey of the horror genre, authorStephen KingdescribedThe Turn of the ScrewandThe Haunting of Hill House(1959) as the only two great supernatural works of horror in a century. He argued that both contain ""secrets best left untold and things left best unsaid"", calling that the basis of the horror genre.[10]Gillian Flynncalled the novella one of the most chilling ghost stories ever written.[11]

Several biographers have indicated that James was familiar withspiritualism, and at the very least regarded it as entertainment. His brotherWilliamwas an active researcher of supernatural phenomena.[12]Scientific inquiry at the time was curious about the existence of ghosts, and James' description of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel—dressed in black with severe expressions—resemble the ghosts found in scientific literature rather than those of fictional narratives.[13]The character of Douglas describes himself as a student ofTrinity College, where James knew research into the supernatural occurred. It is unknown whether James believed in ghosts.[14][a]

By the 1890s, James' readership had dwindled since the success ofDaisy Miller(1878), and he had encountered financial troubles. His health had also worsened, with advancinggout,[15]and several of his close friends had died: his sister and diaristAlice James, and writersRobert Louis StevensonandConstance Fenimore Woolson.[16]In a letter from October 1895, James wrote: ""I see ghosts everywhere"".[17]In an entry in his journal from January 12, 1895, James recounts a ghost story told to him byEdward White Benson, the archbishop of Canterbury, while visiting him for tea at his home two days earlier. The story bears a striking resemblance to what would eventually becomeThe Turn of the Screw, with depraved servants corrupting young children before and after their deaths.[18]

Towards the end of 1897, James was contracted to write a twelve-part ghost story forCollier's Weekly, an illustrated magazine. Having just signed a twenty-one year lease on a house in Rye, East Sussex, James —thankful for the additional income—accepted the offer.[19][20]Collier's Weeklypaid James US$900 (equivalent to US$34,000 in 2024) for the serial rights.[21]A year earlier, in 1897,The Chap-Bookpaid him US$150 (equivalent to US$5,700 in 2024) for serial and book rights toWhat Maisie Knew.[22]

James found it difficult to write by hand,[23]reserving that for his journals.The Turn of the Screwwas dictated to his secretary, William MacAlpine, who took shorthand notes and returned with typed notes the following day. Finding such a delay frustrating, James purchased his ownRemingtontypewriter and dictated directly to MacAlpine.[24][25]In December 1897, James wrote to his sister-in-law: ""Ihave, at last, finished my little book.""[26]

The Turn of the Screwwas first published in the magazineCollier's Weekly, serialised in 12 installments (27 January – 16 April 1898). The title illustration byJohn La Fargedepicts the governess with her arm around Miles. Episode illustrations were byEric Pape.[27]

In October 1898, the novella appeared with the short story ""Covering End"" in a volume titledThe Two Magics, published byMacmillanin New York City and byHeinemannin London.[28]

Ten years after publication, James revisedThe Turn of the Screwfor theNew York Editionof the text.[29]James made many changes, but most were minor, such as changing ""utter"" to ""express""; the narrative was unchanged. TheNew York Edition's most important contribution was the retrospective account of the influences and writing of the novella James gave in his preface. James indicated, for example, that he was aware of research into the supernatural.[30]In his preface, James only briefly mentions the story's origin in a magazine. In 2016, Kirsten MacLeod, citing James' private correspondence, indicated that he had a strong dislike for the serial form.[31]

Early reviews emphasised the novella's power to frighten, and most saw the tale as a brilliant, if simple, ghost story.[33]According to scholar Terry Heller, most early reviewers saw the novel as a formidable piece of Gothic fiction.[34]

An early review ofThe Turn of the Screwwas inThe New York Times Saturday Review of Books and Art, stating it was worthy of being compared to Robert Louis Stevenson'sStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886). The reviewer noted it as a successful study of evil, referring to the ghosts' influence over the children and the governess.[35]Scholar Terry Heller notes that the children featured prominently in early criticism because the novella violated a Victorian presumption of childhood innocence.[36]

Conceptions of the text wherein the ghosts are real entities are often referred to as the ""apparitionist interpretation"";[37]consequently, a ""non-apparitionist"" holds the opposite perspective.[38]In a 1918 essay,Virginia Woolfwrote that Miss Jessel and Peter Quint possessed ""neither the substance nor independent existence of ghosts"".[39]Woolf did not suggest that the ghosts were hallucinations, but—in a similar fashion to other early critics—said they represented the governess' growing awareness of evil in the world. The power of the story, she argued, was in forcing readers to realise the dark places fiction could take their minds.[40]

In 1934, literary criticEdmund Wilsonposited that the ghosts were hallucinations of the governess, who he suggested was sexually repressed. As evidence, Wilson points to her background as the daughter of a country parson, and suggests that she is infatuated with her employer.[41]Before Wilson's article, another critic—Edna Kenton—had written to similar effect, but Wilson's fame as a literary critic shifted the discourse around the novella completely.[42][43][c]Wilson drew heavily from Kenton's writing, but applied explicitlyFreudianterminology.[44]For example, he pointed to Quint first being sighted by the governess on a phallic tower.[45]A book-lengthclose readingof the text was produced in 1965 using Wilson's Freudian analysis as a foundation; it characterised the governess as increasingly mad and hysterical.[46]Leon Edel, James' most influential biographer, wrote that it is not the ghosts who haunt the children, but the governess.[47]

While many supported Wilson's theory, it was by no means authoritative.[48]Robert B. Heilmanwas a prominent advocate for the apparitionist interpretation; he saw the story as aHawthornesqueallegory about good and evil, and the ghosts as active agents to that effect.[49]Scholars critical of Wilson's essay pointed to Douglas' positive account of the governess's character in the prologue, long after her death. Most crucially, they indicated that the governess's description of the ghost enabled Mrs Grose to identify him as Peter Quint before the governess knew he existed.[49]The second point led Wilson to ""retract his thesis (temporarily)"";[48]in a later revision of his essay, he argued the governess had been made aware of another male at Bly by Mrs Grose.[50][d]

In the 1970s, critics began to applystructuralistTzvetan Todorov's notion of thefantastictoThe Turn of the Screw.[51][52]Todorov emphasised the importance of ""hesitation"" in stories with supernatural elements, and critics found an abundance of them within James' novella. For example, the reader's sympathy may hesitate between the children or the governess,[53]and the text hesitates between supporting the ghosts' existence, and rejecting them.[54]Christine Brooke-Roseargued in a three-part essay that the ambiguity so frequently argued over was a foundational part of the text that had been ignored.[55]From the 1980s onwards, critics increasingly refused to ask questions aboutdiegeticelements of the text, instead acknowledging that many elements simply cannot be known definitively.[56]

Focus shifted away from whether the ghosts were real and onto how James generated and then sustained the text's ambiguity. A study into revisions James made to two paragraphs in the novella concluded that James was not striving for clarity, but to create a text which could not be interpreted definitively in either direction.[57]

This is still a position held by many critics, such asGiovanni Bottiroli[it], who argues that evidence for the intended ambiguity of the text can be found at the beginning of the novella, where Douglas tells his fictional audience that the governess had never told anyone but himself about the events that happened at Bly, and that they ""would easily judge"" why. Bottiroli believes that this address to Douglas' fictional audience is also meant as an address to the reader, telling them that they will ""easily judge"" whether or not the ghosts are real.[58]

After the debate over the reality of the ghosts quieted in literary criticism, critics began to apply other theoretical frameworks toThe Turn of the Screw.Marxistcritics argued that the emphasis placed by academics on James' language distracted fromclass-based explorations of the text.[59]The children's uncle, who featured largely only in the psychoanalytic interpretations as an obsession of the governess, was regarded by some as symbolising a selfishupper-class. Heath Moon notes how he abandoned his orphaned niece, nephew, and their ancestral home to instead live in London as a bachelor.[60]Mrs Grose's distaste for the relationship between Quint and Miss Jessel was noted to be part of aVictoriandislike for relationships that were between different social classes.[61]The death of Miles and Flora's parents in India became a fixture ofpostcolonialexplorations of the text, given the status of India as aBritish colonyduring James' lifetime.[62]

Explorations of the governess have become a mainstay offeministwriting on the text. Priscilla Walton noted that James' account of the story's origin disparaged the ability of women to tell stories, and framedThe Turn of the Screwas James thus telling it on their behalf.[63]Others see James in a more positive light. Paula Marantz Cohen positively compares James' treatment of the governess to Sigmund Freud's writing about a young woman namedDora. Cohen likens the way that Freud transforms Dora into merely a summary of her symptoms to how critics such as Edmund Wilson reduced the governess to a case of neurotic sexual repression.[64]

The Turn of the Screwhas been the subject of a range of adaptations and reworkings in a variety of media. Many of these have, themselves, been analysed in the academic literature on Henry James andneo-Victorianculture.[65]

The novella was adapted toan operabyBenjamin Britten, which premiered in 1954,[65]and the opera has been filmed on multiple occasions.[66]The novella was adapted as a ballet score (1980) byLuigi Zaninelli,[67]and separately as a ballet (1999) by Will Tucket for theRoyal Ballet.[68]Harold PinterdirectedThe Innocents(1950), a Broadway play which was an adaptation ofThe Turn of the Screw.[69]An adaptation byJeffrey Hatcher, using the titleThe Turn of the Screw, premiered in Portland, Maine, in 1996 and was producedoff-Broadwayin 1999.[70]Another adaptation of the same title byRebecca Lenkiewiczwas presented in a co-production withHammerat theAlmeida Theatre, London, in January 2013.[71]

There have been numerous film adaptations of the novel.[67]The critically acclaimedThe Innocents(1961), directed byJack Clayton, andMichael Winner's prequelThe Nightcomers(1972) are two notable examples.[65]Other feature film adaptations includeRusty Lemorande's 1992 eponymous adaptation (set in the 1960s);[72]Eloy de la Iglesia'sSpanishlanguageOtra vuelta de tuerca(The Turn of the Screw, 1985);[67]Presence of Mind(1999), directed by Atoni Aloy; andIn a Dark Place(2006), directed by Donato Rotunno.[66]The Others(2001) is not an adaptation but has some themes in common with James's novella.[66][73]In 2018, directorFloria Sigismondifilmed an adaptation of the novella, titledThe Turning, on theKilruddery Estatein Ireland.[74]

Television films have included a 1959 American adaptation as part ofFord Startimedirected byJohn Frankenheimerand starringIngrid Bergman;[66][75]the West GermanDie sündigen Engel(The Sinful Angel, 1962),[76]a1974 adaptationdirected byDan Curtis, adapted byWilliam F.

The Turn of the Screwhas also influenced television.[85]In December 1968, the ABC daytime dramaDark Shadowsfeatured a storyline based onThe Turn of the Screw. In the story, the ghosts ofQuentin Collinsand Beth Chavez haunted the west wing of Collinwood, possessing the two children living in the mansion. The story led to a year-long story in the year 1897, as Barnabas Collins travelled back in time to prevent Quentin's death and stop the possession.[85]In early episodes ofStar Trek: Voyager(""Cathexis"", ""Learning Curve"" and ""Persistence of Vision""),Captain Kathryn Janewayis seen on theholodeckacting out scenes from theholonovelJaneway Lambda one, which appears to be based onThe Turn of the Screw.[86]The novel was adapted as a Mexican miniseries entitledOtra vuelta de tuerca(The Turn of the Screw) in 1981,[76]and in 2020,Netflixadapted the novella asThe Haunting of Bly Manorfor the second season ofMike Flanagan'sThe Hauntinganthology series.[87][88]"

He accepts a wager for £20,000, half of his fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45 p.m.; to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later. They take Fogg's remaining £20,000 with them to cover expenses during the journey.

Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez on time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by aScotland Yardpoliceman, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of James Strand, a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of Strand, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (theMongolia) conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They arrive in Bombay on 20 October, two days ahead of schedule, and board a train heading towardsCalcuttathat evening.

The early arrival in Bombay proves beneficial for Fogg and Passepartout, as contrary to what the newspaper article had said, an 80 km (50 mi) stretch of track from Kholby toAllahabadhas not yet been built. Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide and starts toward Allahabad.

They come across a procession in which a young Indian woman,Aouda, is about to beburned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Since she is drugged withopiumandhashishand is not going voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of her deceased husband on the funeral pyre. He rises from the pyre during the ceremony, scaring off the priests and carries Aouda away. The two days gained earlier are lost but Fogg shows no regret.

Fogg and Passepartout re-board the train at Allahabad, taking Aouda with them. When the travelers arrive in Calcutta, Fix, who had arrived ahead of them, has Fogg and Passepartout arrested for a crime Passepartout had committed in Bombay. They jump bail and board a steamer (theRangoon) going toHong Kong, with a day's stopover inSingapore. Fix also boards theRangoon; he shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his friend from the earlier voyage.

In Hong Kong, the group learns Aouda's distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved toHolland, so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, theCarnatic, Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama but cannot inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.

Fogg discovers he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him toYokohama, finding a pilot boat, theTankadere, that takes him, Aouda, and Fix toShanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. There, they search for Passepartout, believing he arrived on theCarnaticas initially planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, theGeneral Grant, taking them across thePacifictoSan Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey but instead support him in getting back to Britain, where he can arrest him.

In San Francisco, they board atranscontinentaltrain toNew York City, encountering several obstacles along the way: a herd ofbisoncrossing the tracks, a failingsuspension bridgeand a band ofSiouxwarriors ambushing the train. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the warriors. Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by awind-poweredsledtoOmahaand then get a train to New York.

In New York, having missed the shipChina, Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat,Henrietta, destined forBordeaux, France. The captain of the boat refuses to take them to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 per passenger. He then bribes the crew tomutinyand makes course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. When the coal runs out, Fogg buys the boat from the captain, then has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.

The companions arrive atQueenstown (Cobh), Ireland, take the train toDublinand then a ferry toLiverpool, still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up – the actual robber had been caught three days earlier inEdinburgh. As a result of the delay, Fogg misses the scheduled train to London; he orders a special train and arrives in London apparently five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.

The following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, their days were shortened by four minutes for every degree of longitude they crossed; thus, although they had experienced the same amount of time abroad as people had experienced in London, they had seen 80 sunrises and sunsets while London had seen only 79. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake and Fogg hurries to the Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having spent almost £19,000 of his travel money during the journey, he divides the remainder between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.

Around the World in Eighty Dayswas written during difficult times, both for France and Verne. It was during theFranco-Prussian War(1870–1871) in which Verne wasconscriptedas a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paidroyalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed apublic execution, which disturbed him.[6]

The technological innovations of the 19th century had opened the possibility of rapid circumnavigation, and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–1870 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: the completion of thefirst transcontinental railroadin America (1869), the opening of theSuez Canal(1869), and thelinking of the Indian railwaysacross the sub-continent (1870). It was another notable mark at the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.[6]

The story began serialization inLe Tempson 6 November 1872.[7]The story was published in installments over the next 45 days, with its ending timed to synchronize Fogg's December 21 deadline with the real world. Chapter XXXV appeared on 20 December;[8]21 December, the date upon which Fogg was due to appear back in London, did not include an installment of the story;[9]on 22 December, the final two chapters announced Fogg's success.[10]As it was being published serially for the first time, some readers believed that the journey was actually taking place – bets were placed, and some railway companies and ship liner companies lobbied Verne to appear in the book. It is unknown if Verne submitted to their requests, but the descriptions of some rail and shipping lines leave some suspicion he was influenced.[6]

Concerning the finalcoup de théâtre, Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was because he had forgotten that during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rate of an hour per 15° oflongitudecrossed. At the time of publication and until 1884, ade jureInternational Date Linedid not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, Fogg's mistake would not have been likely to occur in the real world because ade factodate line did exist. The UK, India, and the US had the same calendar with different local times. When he arrived in San Francisco, he would have noticed that the local date was one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. Consequently, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the Chinasteamerin New York were one day earlier than his travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, inWho Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?,John Sutherlandpoints out that Fogg and company would have to be ""deaf, dumb and blind"" not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent ""Sunday"", with theSunday Observance Act 1780still in effect.[11]

Following publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg's fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints:

The idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the titleAround the World in Eighty Daysis not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.[6]

Another early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni FrancescoGemelli Careri. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World orVoyage du Tour du Monde(1719, Paris).[19]

Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway, was published in 1871 by theUnion Pacific Railroad Company, and anAround the World in A Hundred and Twenty Daysby Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of 38,204 km (23,739 mi) in 77 days and 21 hours.[20]

AmericanWilliam Perry Foggtraveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters toThe Cleveland Leadernewspaper, entitled,Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt(1872).[21][22]

In 1872,Thomas Cookorganised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters published in 1873 asLetter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World.Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne's account and Cook's letters. However, some argue that Cook's trip happened too late to influence Verne. According to a second-hand 1898 account, Verne refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book. In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was ""through reading one day in a Paris cafe"" and ""due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.""Around the Worlditself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook's advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.[6]

The periodicalLe Tour du monde(3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled ""Around the World in Eighty Days"", which refers to 230 km (140 mi) of the railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne's work. But even theLe Tour de mondearticle was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography theNouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Archéologie(August 1869), which also contains the titleAround the World in Eighty Daysin its contents page. TheNouvelles Annaleswere written byConrad Malte-Brun(1775–1826) and his sonVictor Adolphe Malte-Brun(1816–1889). Scholars[who?]believe that Verne was aware of theLe Tour de mondearticle, theNouvelles Annales,or both and that he consulted it or them, noting that theLe Tour du mondeeven included a trip schedule very similar to Verne's final version.[6]

A possible inspiration was the travellerGeorge Francis Train, who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, ""Verne stole my thunder. I'm Phileas Fogg.""[6]

Regarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: ""I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in theSièclethat a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was adénouementready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form."" In his April 1873 lecture, ""The Meridians and the Calendar"", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day occurred since theInternational Date Lineonly became current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article inNature,andEdgar Allan Poe's short story ""Three Sundays in a Week"" (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in hisEdgar Poe and His Works(1864).[6]

The book has been adapted or reimagined many times in different forms."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1531,"Othello, the Moor of Venice",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello,"Roderigo, a wealthy and dissolute gentleman, complains to his friend Iago, anensign, that Iago has not told him about the recent secret marriage between Desdemona, the daughter of Brabantio, a senator, and Othello, aMoorishgeneral in the Venetian army. Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage, which Brabantio denied him.

Iago hates Othello for promoting an aristocrat named Cassio above him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself. Iago tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage and convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter'selopement. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him.

Brabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and seeks to confront Othello, but he finds Othello accompanied by the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice thatthe Turks are going to attack Cyprus, and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona bywitchcraft.

Othello defends himself before theDuke of Venice, Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that, while he was invited to Brabantio's home, Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves, saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: ""Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father, and may thee"" (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island ofCyprus, accompanied by his new wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant.

The party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyed the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio. This leads to their fighting one another and Montano's being injured. Othello arrives and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio, distraught, is then persuaded by Iago to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.

Iago persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona's relationship. When Desdemona drops ahandkerchief(the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it and gives it to Iago at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello appears and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife's unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant.

Iago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.

Enraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.

Roderigo unsuccessfully attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's lodgings, as Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to death to stop him from revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.

Othello confronts a sleeping Desdemona. She denies being unfaithful, but he smothers her. Emilia arrives, and Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what Iago has done, and she exposes him. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona's innocence, stabs Iago (but not fatally), saying that Iago is a devil, but not before the latter stabs Emilia to death in the scuffle.

Iago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.

Shakespeare's primary source for the plot was the story of a Moorish Captain (third decade, story seven) inGli HecatommithibyCinthio(Giovanni Battista Giraldi), a collection of one hundrednovellasabout love, grouped into ten ""decades"" by theme.[1]The third decade deals with marital infidelity.[2]Of Cinthio's characters, only Disdemona (the equivalent of Shakespeare's Desdemona – her name means ""ill-omened"" in Italian) is named – the others are simply called the Moor (the equivalent of Othello), the Ensign (Iago), the Corporal (Cassio) and similar descriptions.[3][4]In its story the Ensign falls in love with the Moor's wife Disdemona, but her indifference turns his love to hate and in revenge he persuades the Moor that Disdemona has been unfaithful. The Moor and the Ensign murder Disdemona with socks filled with sand, and bring down the ceiling of her bedchamber to make it appear an accident. The story continues until the Ensign is tortured to death for unrelated reasons and the Moor is killed by Disdemona's family.[3][a]

Shakespeare's direct sources for the story do not include any threat of warfare: it seems to have been Shakespeare's innovation to set the story at the time of a threatened Turkish invasion of Cyprus—apparently fixing it inthe events of 1570. Those historical events would however have been well known to Shakespeare's original audience, who would therefore have been aware that—contrary to the action of the play—the Turks took Cyprus, and still held it.[5][6]

Scholars have identified many other influences onOthello. Works which are not themselves sources but whose impact on Shakespeare can be identified in the play[7]includeVirgil'sAeneid,[8]Ovid'sMetamorphoses,[9]bothThe Merchant's TaleandThe Miller's TalefromChaucer'sThe Canterbury Tales,[10]Geoffrey Fenton'sCertaine Tragicall Discourses,[11][12]Kyd'sThe Spanish Tragedy,[13]George Peele'sThe Battle of Alcazar,[14][15]the anonymousArden of Faversham,[16][17]Marlowe'sDoctor Faustus,[18]andHeywood'sA Woman Killed with Kindness.[19]Influences also include Shakespeare's own earlier playsMuch Ado About Nothing, in which a similar plot was used in a comedy,[20]The Merchant of Venicewith its high-born, Moorish, Prince of Morocco,[21]andTitus Andronicus, in which a Moor, Aaron, was a prominent villain, and as such was a forerunner of both Othello and Iago.[22][23][24]

One such influence is not a literary work at all. In 1600, London was visited for ""half a year"" by the Moorish ambassador of the King of Barbary, whose entourage caused a stir in the city.Shakespeare's companyis known to have played at court during the time of the visit, and so would have encountered the foreign visitors at first hand.[25]

Among Shakespeare's non-fiction, or partly-fictionalised, sources wereGasparo Contarini'sCommonwealth and Government of Venice[26][27]andLeo Africanus'sA Geographical Historie of Africa.[28][29][30]Himself a Moor from Barbary, Leo said of his own people ""they are so credulous they will beleeue matters impossible, which are told them"" and ""no nation in the world is so subject vnto iealousie; for they will rather [lose] their liues than put vp any disgrace in the behalfe of their women""—both traits seen in Shakespeare's Othello.[31]And from Leo's own life story Shakespeare took a well-born, educated African finding a place at the height of a white European power.[30]FromPhilemon Holland's translation ofPliny'sNatural HistoryShakespeare took the references to the Pontic Sea,[32]to Arabian trees with their medicinable gum,[33]and to the ""Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders"",[34][35]elements which also featured in the fantasticThe Travels of Sir John Mandeville.[12][36]

Theterminus ad quemforOthello(that is, the latest year in which the play could have been written) is 1604, since a performance of the play in that year is mentioned in the accounts book ofSir Edmund Tilney, thenMaster of the Revels.[37][38]

Aterminus a quo(i.e. the earliest year in which it could have been written) is given by the fact that one of its sources,Holland's translation ofPliny'sNatural History, was published in 1601.[37]

Within this range, scholars have tended to date the play 1603–1604, within the reign ofJames I, since the play appears to have elements designed to appeal to the new king, who had written a poem about the defeat of the Turkish navy atLepanto, and to the new queen,Anne of Denmark, in whose circle there was an interest in the blackface exoticism also reflected inBen Jonson'sThe Masque of Blackness, in which the queen and herladiesappeared as ""daughters of Niger"".[39]That dating is supported by similarities toMeasure for Measure, another of Shakespeare's plays often dated around 1604, and which, likeOthello, draws its plot fromCinthio'sGli Hecatommithi.[40]This date is also supported by the possibility that Shakespeare may have consultedRichard Knolles' 1603The Generall Historie of the Turkes.[40]

However, evidence of an earlier date, 1601–1602, is provided by the so-calledbad quartoof Shakespeare's playHamlet, published in 1603. The theory is that the bad quarto is a memorial reconstruction ofHamlet, made by some of its actors: so where there are unintentional echoes ofOthelloin the bad quarto (for example ""to my vnfolding / Lend thy listning eare""[41]in the bad quarto and ""To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear""[42]inOthello—and a number of others) it suggests that the actors must have been performingOthello, at the latest, in the season preceding the bad quarto's publication.[43]

Othellowas not published in Shakespeare's lifetime.[44]The first published version of the play was aquartoin 1622 (usually abbreviated to ""Q""), which was followed a year later by the play's appearance in theFirst Folio(usually abbreviated to ""F"").[44]

There are significant differences between the two early editions, the most prominent of which are:

There is no scholarly consensus to account for the differences between Q and F:[49]

AsThe Oxford Shakespeareeditor Michael Neill summarises things: ""The textual mystery ofOthellois unlikely ever to be resolved to general satisfaction.""[56]

The influential early twentieth-century Shakespeare criticA. C. Bradleydefined Othello's tragic flaw as a sexual jealousy so intense that it ""converts human nature into chaos, and liberates the beast in man ... the animal in man forcing itself into his consciousness in naked grossness, and he writhing before it but powerless to deny it entrance, grasping inarticulate images of pollution, and finding relief only in a bestial thirst for blood.""[58]

This jealousy is symbolized in the play through animal imagery. In the early acts of the play it is Iago who mentions ass, daws, flies, ram, jennet, guinea-hen, baboon, wild-cat, snipe, monkeys, monster and wolves. But from the third act onwards Othello catches this line of imagery from Iago as his irrational jealousy takes hold.[59]The same occurs with ""diabolical"" imagery (i.e. images of hell and devils) of which Iago uses 14 of his 16 diabolical images in the first two acts, yet Othello uses 25 of his 26 in the last three acts.[60]

Not only Othello, but also Iago is consumed by jealousy: his is a kind of envy, which contemporary scholarFrancis Baconcalled ""the vilest affection, and the most depraved; for which cause, it is the proper attribute of the Devil... As it always cometh to pass, that envy worketh subtilly, and in the dark; and to the prejudice of good things.""[61]

Sometimes critics have struggled to define the kind of jealousy Othello suffers, or to deny it as a motive (for example, those who claim that in Russia between 1945 and 1957 only one actor portrayed Othello as obsessed by jealousy). In fact jealousy is a wide-ranging emotion and encompasses the spectrum from lust to spiritual disillusionment within which Othello's obsession must fall. And he displays many accepted aspects of jealousy: an eagerness to snatch at proofs, indulging degrading images of the jealousy's object, snatching at ambiguities to ease the mind, dread of vulgar ridicule, and a spirit of vindictiveness.[62]

AsBen Okrihas said:

Or, as theOxfordeditor Professor Michael Neill summarises it:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500,Siddhartha,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel),"The story takes place in ancient India, where Siddhartha decides to leave his home in the hope of gainingspiritual illuminationby becoming anasceticSamana. Joined by his best friendGovinda, Siddhartha fasts, becomes homeless, renounces all personal possessions, and intensely meditates. Eventually the pair seek out and personally speak withthe enlightened Gautama, but although Govinda hastily joins the Buddha's order, Siddhartha does not. For him, theBuddhist philosophy, though supremely wise, must be individually realized independently of instruction by a teacher. He thus resolves to carry on his quest alone.

Siddhartha crosses a river and the ferryman, whom Siddhartha is unable to pay, predicts that Siddhartha will return later to compensate him in some way. Venturing onward toward city life, Siddhartha encounters thecourtesanKamala, the most beautiful woman he has seen. She notes Siddhartha's handsome appearance and fast wit, but warns him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love. Although Siddhartha despisedmaterialistic pursuitsas a Samana, he agrees now to Kamala's suggestion. She directs him to the employ of Kamaswami, a local businessman, and insists that he have Kamaswami treat him as an equal rather than an underling. Siddhartha easily succeeds, providing a voice of patience and tranquility, which Siddhartha learned from his days as an ascetic, against Kamaswami's fits of passion. Thus Siddhartha becomes a rich man and Kamala's lover, but in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game that lacks spiritual fulfillment. Leaving the bustle of the city, Siddhartha returns to the river, disillusioned and contemplating suicide. Falling into a meditative sleep, he is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word,Om.

The next morning, Siddhartha briefly reconnects with Govinda, who is passing through the area as a wandering Buddhist monk. Siddhartha decides to live the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river, companioning Vasudeva, the elderly ferryman, with whom he begins a humbler way of life. Although Vasudeva is a simple man, he has spiritual insight and relates that the river has many voices and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen.

Some years later, Kamala, now a Buddhist convert, is traveling to see the Buddha on his deathbed, accompanied by her reluctant young son, when she is bitten by a venomous snake near the river bank. Siddhartha recognizes her and she informs him that the boy is his own son. After Kamala's death, Siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy, until one day the child flees altogether. Although Siddhartha is desperate to follow the runaway, Vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path, just as Siddhartha did himself in his youth. Listening to the river with Vasudeva, Siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences, even those of suffering, are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature. After Siddhartha's moment of illumination, Vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods, leaving Siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more.

Toward the end of his life, Govinda hears about anenlightenedferryman and travels to Siddhartha, not initially recognizing him as his old childhood companion. Govinda asks the now-elderly Siddhartha to relate his wisdom and Siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth. Because nature works in a self-sustaining cycle, every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete. Siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness. He then requests the puzzled Govinda to kiss his forehead; when he does so, Govinda experiences the same visions of timelessness that Siddhartha himself saw with Vasudeva by the river. Govinda then bows to his wise and radiantly smiling friend.

In Hesse's novel, experience, the totality of conscious events of a human life, is shown as the best way to approach understanding of reality and attain enlightenment⁠—⁠Hesse's crafting of Siddhartha's journey shows that understanding is attained not through intellectual methods, nor through immersing oneself in the carnal pleasures of the world and the accompanying pain ofsamsara; rather, it is the completeness of these experiences that allows Siddhartha to attain understanding.

Thus, individual events are meaningless when considered by themselves—⁠Siddhartha's stay with the Samanas and his immersion in the worlds of love and business do notipso factolead tonirvana, yet they cannot be considered distractions, for every action and event gives Siddhartha experience, which in turn leads to understanding.

A major preoccupation of Hesse in writingSiddharthawas to cure his ""sickness with life"" (Lebenskrankheit) by immersing himself inIndian philosophysuch as that expounded in theUpanishadsand theBhagavad Gita.[2]The reason the second half of the book took so long to write was that Hesse ""had not experienced that transcendental state of unity to which Siddhartha aspires. In an attempt to do so, Hesse lived as a virtual semi-recluseand became totally immersed in the sacred teachings of bothHinduandBuddhistscriptures. His intention was to attain to that 'completeness' which, in the novel, is theBuddha's badge of distinction.""[3]The novel is structured on three of the traditionalstages of lifefor Hindu males (student (brahmacharin), householder (grihastha) and recluse/renunciate (vanaprastha) as well as the Buddha'sFour Noble Truths(Part One) andEightfold Path(Part Two) which form twelve chapters, the number in the novel.[4]

Ralph Freedman mentions how Hesse commented in a letter ""[my] Siddhartha does not, in the end, learn true wisdom from any teacher, but from a river that roars in a funny way and from a kindly old fool who always smiles and is secretly asaint.""[5]In a lecture about Siddhartha, Hesse claimed ""Buddha's way tosalvationhas often been criticized and doubted, because it is thought to be wholly grounded incognition. True, but it's not just intellectual cognition, not just learning and knowing, butspiritualexperience that can be earned only through strict discipline in a selfless life"".[6]Freedman also points out howSiddharthadescribed Hesse's interiordialectic: ""All of the contrasting poles of his life were sharply etched: the restless departures and the search for stillness at home; the diversity of experience and the harmony of a unifying spirit; the security ofreligiousdogmaand theanxietyoffreedom.""[7]Eberhard Ostermann has shown how Hesse, while mixing the religious genre of the legend with that of the modern novel, seeks to reconcile with the double-edged effects ofmodernizationsuch as individualization, pluralism or self-disciplining.[8]The character Siddhartha honors the character Gotama (Gautama Buddha) by not following him in person, but by following Gotama's example.

Zachariah, an adaptation loosely based on two Hesse novels includingSiddhartha, was released as a musical Western in 1971.[9]In the following year, a film version of the novel was released asSiddhartha, starringShashi Kapoorand directed byConrad Rooks.

Musical compositions based on the novel have includedClaude Vivier'ssymphonic poem,Siddhartha(1976),[10][11]andPete Townshend's song ""The Ferryman"", written for an amateur dramatisation in June 1976.[12][13]Townshend's wifeRachel Fullercomposed a 'literary and musical reinvention' of the novel by 2024, titled ""The Seeker"", starring him as the ferryman.[14]Earlier, in 2015,Joel Puckettcomposed a piece for wind ensemble titled ""That Secret from the River"", based on the Ferryman's words from the book: ""Have you also learned that secret from the river; that there is no such thing as time? That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future.""[15]

There was also an Indian-themed photographic essay byFred Mayerpublished in 2011 under the title ""Homage to Hermann Hesse and His Siddhartha""[16]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1254,Cyrano de Bergerac,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrano_de_Bergerac_(play),"Hercule Savinien deCyrano de Bergerac, acadet(nobleman serving as a soldier) in theFrench Army, is a brash, strong-willed man of many talents. In addition to being a remarkable duelist, he is a gifted, joyful poet who also plays music. However, he has an obnoxiously large nose, which causes him to doubt himself. This doubt prevents him from expressing his love for his distant cousin, the beautiful and intellectual Roxane, as he believes that his ugliness would bar him from the ""dream of being loved by even an ugly woman.""  Roxane loves the fair Christian de Neuvillette, who is too tongue-tied to romance her.  Cyrano famously writes love letters to Roxane, pretending to be Christian.

The play opens inParis, 1640, in the theatre of theHôtel de Bourgogne. Members of the audience slowly arrive, representing a cross-section of Parisian society from pickpockets to nobility. Christian de Neuvillette, a handsome new cadet, arrives with Lignière, a drunkard who he hopes will identify the young woman with whom he has fallen in love. Lignière recognizes her as Roxane, and he tells Christian about her and the Count de Guiche's scheme to marry her off to the compliant Viscount Valvert. Meanwhile, Ragueneau and Le Bret are expecting Cyrano de Bergerac, who has, without any authority, banished the actor Montfleury from the stage for a month. After Lignière leaves, Christian catches a pickpocket who, in return for his freedom, tells him of a plot against Lignière. Christian departs to try to warn him.

The play ""Clorise"" begins with Montfleury's entrance. Cyrano disrupts the play, forces Montfleury off stage, and compensates the manager for the loss of admission fees. The crowd is going to disperse when Cyrano lashes out at a pesky busybody, then is confronted by Valvert and duels with him while composing aballade, wounding (and possibly killing) him as he ends the refrain (as promised, he ends each refrain withQu'à la fin de l'envoi, je touche!: ""Then, as I end the refrain, thrust home!"") When the crowd has cleared the theater, Cyrano and Le Bret remain behind, and Cyrano confesses his love for Roxane. Roxane'sduennathen arrives, and asks where Roxane may meet Cyrano privately. Lignière is then brought to Cyrano, having learned that one hundred hired thugs are waiting to ambush him on his way home. Cyrano, now emboldened, vows to take on the entire mob single-handed, and he leads a procession of officers, actors and musicians to the Porte de Nesle.

The next morning, at Ragueneau's bake shop, Ragueneau supervises various apprentice cooks in their preparations. Cyrano arrives, anxious about his meeting with Roxane. He is followed by a musketeer, a paramour of Ragueneau's domineering wife Lise, then the regular gathering of impoverished poets who take advantage of Ragueneau's hospitality and love for poetry. Cyrano composes a letter to Roxane expressing his deep and unconditional love for her, warns Lise about her indiscretion with the musketeer and, when Roxane arrives, signals Ragueneau to leave them alone.

Roxane and Cyrano talk privately as she bandages his hand (injured from the fracas at the Port de Nesle); she thanks him for defeating Valvert at the theater, and talks about a man with whom she has fallen in love. Cyrano thinks that she is talking about him at first, and is ecstatic, but Roxane describes her beloved as ""handsome,"" and tells him that she is in love with Christian de Neuvillette. Roxane fears for Christian's safety in the predominantlyGasconcompany of Cadets, and asks Cyrano to befriend and protect him. This he agrees to do.

After she leaves, Cyrano's captain arrives with the cadets to congratulate him on his victory from the previous night. They are followed by a huge crowd, including de Guiche and his entourage, but Cyrano soon drives them away. Le Bret takes him aside and chastises him for his behavior, but Cyrano responds haughtily. The Cadets press him to tell the story of the fight, teasing the newcomer Christian de Neuvillette. When Cyrano recounts the tale, Christian displays his own form of courage by interjecting several times with references to Cyrano's nose. Cyrano is angry, but remembering his promise to Roxane, holds in his temper.

Eventually Cyrano explodes at the insults, the shop is evacuated, and Cyrano reveals his identity as Roxane's cousin. Christian confesses his love for Roxane but also his inability to woo her because of what he feels is a lack of intellect and wit. When Cyrano tells Christian that Roxane expects a letter from him, Christian is despondent, having no eloquence in such matters. Cyrano then offers his services, including his own unsigned letter to Roxane. The Cadets and others return to find the two men embracing, and are flabbergasted. The musketeer from before, now thinking it was safe to do so, teases Cyrano about his nose and receives a slap in the face, amusing the Cadets.

Outside Roxane's house Ragueneau is conversing with Roxane's duenna. When Cyrano arrives, Roxane descends and they talk about Christian: Roxane says that Christian's letters have been breathtaking—he is more intellectual than even Cyrano, she declares. She also says that she loves Christian.

When de Guiche arrives, Cyrano hides inside Roxane's house. De Guiche tells Roxane that he has come to say farewell. He has been appointed a colonel of a regiment leaving that night to fight in thewar with Spain. He mentions that the regiment includes Cyrano's unit, and grimly predicts that he and Cyrano will have a reckoning with each other. Afraid for Christian's safety if he should go to the front, Roxane quickly suggests that the best way for de Guiche to seek revenge on Cyrano would be for him to leave Cyrano and his cadets behind while the rest of the regiment achieves military glory. After much flirtation from Roxane, de Guiche believes he should stay close by, concealed in a local monastery. When Roxane implies that she would feel more for de Guiche if he went to war, he agrees to march on steadfastly, leaving Cyrano and his cadets behind. He leaves, and Roxane makes the duenna promise she will not tell Cyrano that Roxane has robbed him of a chance to go to war.

Roxane expects Christian to visit her, and tells the duenna to make him wait if he does. Cyrano presses Roxane to disclose that, instead of questioning Christian on any particular subject, she plans to make Christian improvise about love. Although he tells Christian the details of her plot, when Roxane and her duenna leave, he calls for Christian who has been waiting nearby. Cyrano tries to prepare Christian for his meeting with Roxane, urging him to remember lines Cyrano has written. Christian however refuses saying he wants to speak to Roxane in his own words. Cyrano bows to this saying, ""Speak for yourself, sir.""

During their meeting Christian makes a fool of himself trying to speak seductively to Roxane. Roxane storms into her house, confused and angry. Thinking quickly, Cyrano makes Christian stand in front of Roxane's balcony and speak to her while Cyrano stands under the balcony whispering to Christian what to say. Eventually, Cyrano shoves Christian aside and, under cover of darkness, pretends to be Christian, wooing Roxane himself. In the process, he wins a kiss for Christian.

Roxane and Christian are secretly married by a Capuchin.  Outside, Cyrano meets de Guiche. Cyrano, his face concealed, impersonates a madman, with a tale of a trip to the Moon. De Guiche is fascinated, and delays his journey to hear more. When Cyrano finally reveals his face, de Guiche suggests Cyrano shouldwrite a book.

The newly wed couple's happiness is short-lived: de Guiche, angry to have lost Roxane, declares that he is sending the Cadets of Gascony to the front lines of the war with Spain. De Guiche triumphantly tells Cyrano that the wedding night will have to wait. Under his breath, Cyrano remarks that the news fails to upset him.

Roxane, afraid for Christian, urges Cyrano to promise to keep him safe, out of dangerous situations, dry and warm, and faithful. Cyrano says that he will do what he can but that he cannot promise anything. Roxane begs Cyrano to promise to make Christian write to her every day. Brightening, Cyrano announces confidently that he can promise that.

TheSiege of Arras. The Gascon Cadets are among many French forces now cut off by the Spanish, and are starving. Cyrano, meanwhile, has been writing in Christian's name to Roxane twice daily, smuggling the letters across enemy lines. De Guiche, whom the Cadets despise, arrives and chastises them; Cyrano responds with his usual bravura, and de Guiche then signals a spy to tell the Spanish to attack the Cadets, informing them that they must hold the line until relief arrives. Then a coach arrives, and Roxane emerges from it. She tells how she was able to flirt her way through the Spanish lines. Cyrano tells Christian about the letters, and provides him a farewell letter to give to Roxane if he dies. After de Guiche departs, Roxane provides plenty of food and drink to the cadets with the assistance of the coach's driver, Ragueneau. De Guiche attempts for a second time to convince Roxane to leave the battlefield. When she refuses, de Guiche says he will not leave a lady behind. This impresses the cadets who offer him their leftovers, which de Guiche declines, but he ends up catching the cadets' accent which makes him even more popular with them. Roxane also tells Christian that, because of the letters, she has grown to love him for his soul alone, and would still love him even if he were ugly.

Christian tells this to Cyrano, and then persuades Cyrano to tell Roxane the truth about the letters, saying he has to be loved for ""the fool that he is"" to be truly loved at all. Cyrano disbelieves what Christian claims Roxane has said, until she tells him so as well. But, before Cyrano can tell her the truth, Christian is brought back to the camp, having been fatally shot. Cyrano decides that, in order to preserve Roxane's image of an eloquent Christian, he cannot tell her the truth. The battle ensues, a distraught Roxane collapses and is carried off by de Guiche and Ragueneau, and Cyrano rallies the Cadets to hold off the Spanish until relief arrives.

Fifteen years later, at a convent outside Paris. Roxane now resides here, constantly mourning her beloved Christian. She is visited by de Guiche, who is now a good friend and sees Cyrano as an equal (and has been promoted to duke), Le Bret, and Ragueneau (who has lost his wife and bakery, and is now a candlelighter forMolière), and she expects Cyrano to come by as he always has with news of the outside world. On this day, however, he has been mortally wounded by someone who dropped a huge log on his head from a tall building. Upon arriving to deliver his ""gazette"" to Roxane, knowing it will be his last, he asks Roxane if he can read ""Christian's"" farewell letter. She gives it to him, and he reads it aloud as it grows dark. Listening to his voice, she realizes that it is Cyrano who was the author of all the letters, but Cyrano denies this until he cannot hide it. Ragueneau and Le Bret return, telling Roxane of Cyrano's injury. While Cyrano grows delirious, his friends weep and Roxane tells him that she loves him. He combats various foes, half imaginary and half symbolic, conceding that he has lost all but one important thing – hispanache– as he dies in Le Bret's and Ragueneau's arms.

On 27 December 1897, the curtain rose at theThéâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin,[2]and the audience was pleasantly surprised. A full hour after the curtain fell, the audience was still applauding. The original Cyrano wasConstant Coquelin, who played it over 410 times at said theatre and later toured North America in the role. The original production had sets designed by Marcel Jambon and his associates Brard and Alexandre Bailly (Acts I, III and V),Eugène Carpezat(Act II), and Alfred Lemeunier (Act IV). The earliest touring production ofCyranowas set up by Charles Moncharmont and Maurice Luguet. It was premiered in Monte Carlo on 29 March 1898, and subsequently presented in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Algeria, Tunisia and Spain. Special, transportable sets emulating the Parisian production were created for this tour by Albert Dubosq:

Richard Mansfieldwas the first actor to play Cyrano in the United States in an English translation.

The longest-running Broadway production ran 232 performances in 1923 and starredWalter Hampden, who returned to the role on theGreat White Wayin 1926, 1928, 1932, and 1936.[4]Hampden used the 1923Brian Hookertranslation prepared especially for him, which became such a classic in itself that it was used by virtually every English-speaking Cyrano until the mid-1980s.
In 1946 Hampden passed the torch toJosé Ferrer, who won aTony Awardfor playing Cyrano in a much-praised Broadway staging, the highlight of which was a special benefit performance in which Ferrer played the title role for the first four acts and Hampden (then in his mid-sixties) assumed it for the fifth. Ferrer reprised the role onlive televisionin 1949 and 1955, and in a1950 film versionfor which he won theAcademy Awardfor Best Actor. It became Ferrer's most famous role.

Other notable English-speaking Cyranos wereRalph Richardson,DeVeren Bookwalter,Derek Jacobi, Michael Kanarek,Richard Chamberlain, andChristopher Plummer, who played the part in Rostand's original play and won aTony Awardfor the1973 musical adaptation.Kevin Klineplayed the role in a Broadway production in 2007, withJennifer Garnerplaying Roxane andDaniel Sunjataas Christian. Ataped versionof the production was broadcast on PBS'sGreat Performancesin 2009. In 2018,David Sererois the first French actor to play Cyrano in America in the English language."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1524,"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet,"Prince Hamletof Denmark is the son of the recently deceasedKing Hamlet, and nephew ofKing Claudius, his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouringNorway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, PrinceFortinbras, is imminent.

On a cold night on the ramparts ofElsinore, the Danish royal castle, thesentriesBernardo and Marcellus discuss aghostresembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friendHoratioas a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.

The court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviserPolonius. Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and he sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university inWittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.

As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim ""to thine own self be true.""[6]Polonius's daughter,Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, tells the prince that he was  murdered by Claudius (by pouring poison into his ear as he slept), and demands that Hamlet avenge the murder. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to ""put an antic disposition on"", or act as though he has gone mad. Hamlet forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.

Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen are welcomingRosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the two students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the king of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent againstPoland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.

Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and then speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to learn more. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his ""friends"" warmly but quickly discerns that they are there to spy on him for Claudius. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead remarking ""What a piece of work is a man"". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death ofKing Priam, as witnessed byQueen Hecuba, at the climax of theTrojan War. Hamlet then asks the actors to stageThe Murder of Gonzago, a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder. Hamlet intends to study Claudius's reaction to the play, and thereby determine the truth of the ghost's story of Claudius's guilt.

Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters to the prince while he and Claudius secretly watch in order to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance. Hamlet muses on thoughts oflife versus death. When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries ""get thee to a nunnery"", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing thePlayer Kingmurdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof of his uncle's guilt.

Gertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind atapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.

Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.

Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.

Unhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.

Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Twogravediggersdiscuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of ajesterfrom Hamlet's childhood,Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying ""Alas, poor Yorick"" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia'sfuneral processionapproaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter among Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier,Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet from Laertes. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming ""the rest is silence"". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527,The Sorrows of Young Werther,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther,"Most ofThe Sorrows of Young Werther, a story about a young man's extreme response tounrequited love, is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of a sensitive and passionate temperament, to his friend Wilhelm. These give an intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based onGarbenheim[de;it;nl], nearWetzlar),[4]whose peasants have enchanted him with their simple ways. There he meets Charlotte, a beautiful young girl who takes care of her siblings after the death of their mother. Werther falls in love with Charlotte despite knowing beforehand that she is engaged to a man named Albert, eleven years her senior.[5]

Despite the pain it causes him, Werther spends the next few months cultivating a close friendship with them both. His sorrow eventually becomes so unbearable that he is forced to leave Wahlheim for Weimar, where he makes the acquaintance ofFräuleinvon B. He suffers great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend and unexpectedly has to face there the weekly gathering of the entire aristocratic set. He is not tolerated and asked to leave since he is not a nobleman. He then returns to Wahlheim, where he suffers still more than before, partly because Charlotte and Albert are now married. Every day becomes a torturing reminder that Charlotte will never be able to requite his love. She, out of pity for her friend and respect for her husband, decides that Werther must not visit her so frequently. He visits her one final time, and they are both overcome with emotion after he recites to her a passage of his own translation ofOssian.

Even before that incident, Werther had hinted at the idea that one member of the love triangle—Charlotte, Albert or Werther himself—had to die to resolve the situation. Unable to hurt anyone else or seriously consider murder, Werther sees no other choice but to take his own life. After composing a farewell letter to be found after his death, he writes to Albert asking for his two pistols, on the pretext that he is going ""on a journey"". Charlotte receives the request with great emotion and sends the pistols. Werther then shoots himself in the head, but does not die until twelve hours later. He is buried between two linden trees that he had mentioned frequently in his letters. The funeral is not attended by any clergy, or by Albert or Charlotte. The book ends with an intimation that Charlotte may die of abroken heart: ""I shall say nothing of . . . Charlotte's grief. . . . Charlotte's life was despaired of.""

Wertherwas one of Goethe's few works aligned with the aesthetic, social and philosophical ideals that pervaded the German proto-Romanticmovement known asSturm und Drang, before he andFriedrich von Schillermoved intoWeimar Classicism. The novel was published anonymously, and Goethe distanced himself from it in his later years,[1]regretting the fame it had brought him and the consequent attention to his own youthful love ofCharlotte Buff, then already engaged toJohann Christian Kestner. Although he wroteWertherat the age of 24, it was all for which some of his visitors in his old age knew him. Goethe had changed his views of literature radically by then, even denouncing theRomanticmovement as ""everything that is sick.""[6]

Goethe described the powerful impact the book had on him, writing that even if Werther had been a brother of his whom he had killed, he could not have been more haunted by hisvengeful ghost. Yet, Goethe substantially reworked the book for the 1787 edition[1]and acknowledged the great personal and emotional influence thatThe Sorrows of Young Werthercould exert on forlorn young lovers who discovered it. He later commented to his secretaryJohann Peter Eckermannon January 2, 1824 (as it was recorded by Eckermann and published in his book,Gespräche mit Goethe):[7]

The Sorrows of Young Wertherturned Goethe, previously an unknown author, into a literary celebrity almost overnight.Napoleon Bonaparteconsidered it one of the great works of European literature, having written a Goethe-inspired soliloquy in his youth and carriedWertherwith him on hiscampaigning to Egypt. It also started the phenomenon known as ""Werther Fever,"" which caused young men throughout Europe to dress in the clothing style described for Werther in the novel.[8][9]Items of merchandising such as prints, decoratedMeissen porcelainand even a perfume were produced.[10]Thomas Carlylecoined an epithet, ""Wertherism"",[11]to describe the self-indulgency of the age that the phenomenon represented.[12]When Goethe completed Werther, he likened his mood to one experienced “after a general confession, joyous and free and entitled to a new life”. For Goethe the Werther effect was a cathartic one, freeing himself from the despair in his life.[3]

The book reputedly also led to some of the first known examples ofcopycat suicide, also known as the ""Werther effect"". The men were often dressed in the same clothing ""as Goethe's description of Werther and using similar pistols."" Often the book was found at the scene of the suicide.[13]Rüdiger Safranski, a modern biographer of Goethe, dismisses the Werther Effect ""as only a persistent rumor.""[14]Nonetheless, this aspect of ""Werther Fever"" was watched with concern by the authorities – both the novel and the Werther clothing style were banned inLeipzigin 1775; the novel was also banned in Denmark and Italy.[10]It was also watched with fascination by fellow authors. One of these,Friedrich Nicolai, decided to create a satirical piece with a happy ending, entitledDie Freuden des jungen Werthers(""The Joys of Young Werther""), in which Albert, having realized what Werther is up to, loaded chicken's blood into the pistol, thereby foiling Werther's suicide, and happily concedes Charlotte to him. After some initial difficulties, Werther sheds his passionate youthful side and reintegrates himself into society as a respectable citizen.[15]

Goethe, however, was not pleased with the ""Freuden"" and started a literary war with Nicolai that lasted all his life, writing a poem titled ""Nicolai auf Werthers Grabe"" (""Nicolai on Werther's grave""), in which Nicolai (here a passing nameless pedestrian) defecates on Werther's grave,[16]so desecrating the memory of a Werther from which Goethe had distanced himself in the meantime, as he had from theSturm und Drang. This argument was continued in his collection of short and critical poems theXenienand his playFaust.

TheHebrewtranslationיסורי ורתר הצעירwas popular among youths in the Zionist communities inBritish Mandate of Palestinein the 1930s and 1940s and was blamed for the suicide of several young men considered to have emulated Werther.[citation needed]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1837,The Prince and the Pauper,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Pauper,"Tom Canty, the youngest child of a very poor family living in Offal Court, located inLondon,England, has been abused by his father and grandmother but is encouraged by the localpriest, who taught him to read and write. Loitering around thePalace of Westminstergates one day, Tom seesEdward Tudor, thePrince of Wales. Coming too close in his intense excitement, he is caught and nearly beaten by the royal guards. However, Edward stops them and invites Tom into his palace chamber. There, the two boys get to know one another and are fascinated by each other's lives. They have an uncanny resemblance to each other and learn they were even born on the same day, so they decide to swap clothes ""temporarily"". Edward hides an item, which the reader later learns is theGreat Seal of England, and goes outside to confront the guards who abused Tom; however, dressed as Tom, he is not recognized by the guards, who drive him from the palace.

Tom, dressed as Edward, tries to cope with court customs and manners after being mistaken for the prince. Edward's father,King Henry VIII, his fellow nobles, and the palace staff think the prince has an illness that has causedmemory lossand fear he will gomad. After King Henry dies, Tom is repeatedly asked about the missing Great Seal of England, but he knows nothing about it. However, when Tom is asked to sit in on judgments, his common-sense observations reassure them that his mind is sound.

Edward eventually finds his way through the streets to the Canty home, where the Canty family believes him to be Tom. There, he is subjected to the brutality of Tom'salcoholicfather, from whom he manages to escape, and meets Miles Hendon, a soldier and nobleman returning from war. Although Miles does not believe Edward's claims to royalty, he humors him and becomes his protector. Meanwhile, news reaches them that King Henry has died and Edward has become king.

As Edward experiences the brutal life of a London pauper firsthand, he becomes aware of the stark class inequality in England. In particular, he sees the harsh, punitive nature of the English judicial system, under which people are burned at the stake, pilloried, and flogged. He realizes that the accused are convicted on flimsy evidence and branded or hanged for petty offenses, and he vows to reign with mercy when he regains his rightful place. When Edward declares to a gang of thieves that he is the king and will put an end to unjust laws, they assume he is insane and hold a mockcoronation.

After a series of adventures, including a stint in prison, Edward interrupts thecoronationas Tom is about to be crowned king. The nobles are shocked at their resemblance but refuse to believe that Edward is the rightful king wearing Tom's clothes until he produces the Great Seal of England that he hid before leaving the palace. Edward and Tom switch back to their original places, and Edward is crowned King Edward VI of England. Miles is rewarded with the rank ofEarland the family right to sit in the king's presence. In gratitude for supporting the new king's claim to the throne, Edward names Tom the ""King's Ward"", a privileged position he holds for the rest of his life. The novel ends stating that Tom lived a long life, although it would have been unlikely for both of them to survive the reign ofMary I, while Edward died at the age of 15.

The introductory quote—""The quality of mercy is . . . twice blest; / It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: / 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes / The throned monarch better than his crown""—is part of the ""quality of mercy"" speech fromShakespeare'sThe Merchant of Venice.

While written for children,The Prince and the Pauperis both a critique of social inequality and a criticism of judging others by their appearance. Twain wrote of the book, ""My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others...""[2]

Having returned from a secondEuropean tour—which formed the basis ofA Tramp Abroad(1880)—Twain read extensively about English and French history. Initially intended as a play, the book was originally set inVictorian Englandbefore Twain decided to set it further back in time.[3]He wroteThe Prince and the Pauperhaving already startedAdventures of Huckleberry Finn.

The ""whipping-boy story"", originally meant as a chapter to be part ofThe Prince and the Pauper, was published in theHartfordBazar Budgetof July 4, 1880, before Twain deleted it from the novel at the suggestion ofWilliam Dean Howells.[why?]

Ultimately,The Prince and the Pauperwas published by subscription by James R. Osgood of Boston, with illustrations by Frank Thayer Merrill, John Harley andLudvig Sandöe Ipsen.[4]

The book bears a dedication to Twain's daughters, Susie and Clara Clemens, and is subtitled ""A Tale For Young People of All Ages"".[3]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35018,雲形紋章 (Japanese),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonfleet_(novel),"In 1757 Moonfleet is a small village along the coast of southern England. The village takes its name from a formerly prominent local family, the Mohunes. The main character is John Trenchard, an orphan who lives with his aunt, Miss Jane Arnold. The village church includes thesexton, Mr. Ratsey, and Parson Glennie, who also teaches in the village school.  Elzevir Block is the landlord of theMohune Arms. The inn is nicknamed theWhy Not?, a pun on the Mohunecoat of arms, which includes across-pallin the shape of the letter ""Y"".  Mr. Maskew is the localmagistrate, who has a daughter, Grace. Village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John ""Blackbeard"" Mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. He is reputed to have stolen a diamond from KingCharles Iand hidden it. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities.

As the main part of the story opens, Block's youthful son, David, has just been killed by Maskew during a raid by the Maskew and other authorities on asmugglingboat. One night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. While attending the Sunday service at church, John hears strange sounds from the crypt below. He thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the Mohune family. The next day, he finds Elzevir and Ratsey against the south wall of the church. They claim to be checking for damage from the storm, but John suspects they are searching for Blackbeard's ghost.

Later John finds a largesinkholehas opened in the ground by a grave. He follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. He realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place. He has to hide behind a coffin when he hears Ratsey and Elzevir coming. When they leave, they fill in the hole, inadvertently trapping him. John finds a locket in the coffin that he hid behind (it turns out to be that of Blackbeard himself) which holds a piece of paper with verses from the Bible. John eventually passes out after drinking too much of the wine while trying to quench his thirst, having not eaten or drunk for over 24 hours. Later he wakes up in theWhy Not?inn – he has been rescued by Elzevir and Ratsey. When he is better, he returns to his aunt's house, but she, suspecting him of drunken behaviour, throws him out. Elzevir takes him in.

When Block's lease on theWhy Not?comes up for renewal, Maskew bids against him in the auction and wins. Block must leave the inn and Moonfleet but plans one last smuggling venture. John feels honour-bound to go with him, and visits Grace Maskew, whom he loves and has been seeing in secret, to say goodbye; his aunt gives him his mother's prayer book — her last hope to influence John towards piety. The excisemen and Maskew are aware of the planned smuggling run but do not know exactly where it will occur. During the landing Maskew appears and is caught by the smugglers. Elzevir is bent on vengeance for his son by killing Maskew, and while the rest land the cargo and leave, he and John keep watch over Maskew. Just as Block prepares to shoot Maskew the excisemen attack. They wound John and unintentionally kill Maskew. Block carries John away to safety and they hide in some old quarries. While there, John inadvertently finds out that the verses from Blackbeard's locket contain a code that will reveal the location of his famous diamond.

Once John's wound heals, he and Block decide to recover the diamond fromCarisbrooke Castle. After a suspenseful scene in the well where the jewel is hidden, they succeed in escaping to Holland where they try to sell it to a diamond merchant named Krispijn Aldobrand. The merchant cheats them, claiming the diamond is fake. Elzevir falls for the deceit and angrily throws the diamond out of the window. John, however, knows they have been duped, and suggests they try to recover the diamond through burglary. The attempt fails and they are arrested and sentenced to prison. John curses the merchant for his lies.

John and Elzevir go to prison for life. Eventually they are separated. Then, unexpectedly, ten years later, their paths cross again. They are beingtransported, and board a ship. A storm blows up, and by a strong coincidence, the ship is wrecked upon Moonfleet beach. While trying to reach the beach Elzevir helps John to safety, but is himself dragged under by the surf and drowned.

John arrives where he originally started, in theWhy Not?, and is reunited with Ratsey. He is also reunited with Grace. She is now a rich young lady, having inherited her father's money. However, she is still in love with John. John tells her about the diamond and his life in prison. He regrets having lost everything, but she says, rich or not, she loves him.

Then Parson Glennie visits and reveals he had received a letter from Aldobrand. The merchant, suffering a guilty conscience and in an attempt to make amends, had bequeathed the worth of the diamond to John.

John gives the money to the village, and newalmshousesare built, and the school and the church renovated. John marries Grace and becomes Lord of the Manor and Justice of the Peace. They have three children, including their first-born son, Elzevir. The children grow up, the sons going away to ""serve King George on sea and land"" while their daughter too, it seems, has married away. But John and Grace themselves do not leave their beloved Moonfleet ever again.

One feature of the narrative is a continuing reference to theboardgameofbackgammonwhich is played by the patrons of theWhy Not?on an antique board which bears aLatininscriptionIta in vita ut in lusu aleae pessima jactura arte corrigenda est(translated in the book asAs in life, so in a game of hazard, skill will make something of the worst of throws).[3]

Moonfleetis considered to be a classic work of fiction, and continues to be published in series such as Dover Children's Evergreen Classics.

Its popularity among children worldwide continued up until at least the 1970s, primarily as a result of its adventure themes relating to pirates, treasure, and smuggling, and due to its suspenseful story-line. It has frequently been studied in schools, and used as required reading for some English courses.[4]It is often compared with similar novels like Stevenson'sTreasure Island.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4517,Ethan Frome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Frome,"An unnamed male narrator is working for a power plant, and due to a carpenter's strike finds himself forced to spend a winter in the nearby small town of (fictional) Starkfield, Massachusetts. The man who daily chauffeurs him to work is a limping, quiet man named Ethan Frome, a lifelong resident and local fixture of the community. The narrator learns that Frome's limp arose from being injured in an accident. The story then flashes back 24 years to detail Frome's past.

The young Frome is married to a sickly woman named Zeena (Zenobia), who appears older than her age, is unkind to Ethan, and whose life revolves around seeking expensive treatments for her varied illnesses. Although the Fromes have limited means themselves, they have charitably taken in Zeena's cousin Mattie, whose family is poor. Ethan falls in love with Mattie, and it becomes increasingly clear that Mattie also loves him. While it remains ambiguous if Zeena suspects Ethan's unfaithfulness, she makes plans to send Mattie away. Zeena claims that, because of her failing health, her physician has recommended she hire a maid who will relieve her of housework. Zeena has already arranged for the hired girl to arrive by train soon, and Mattie must vacate her room immediately. Ethan, miserable at the thought of losing Mattie, considers running away with her, but he lacks the money to do so, and will feel guilty about leaving Zeena with the farm.

The next morning, Ethan rushes into town to try to get a cash advance from a customer for a load of lumber in order to have the money with which to elope with Mattie. His plan is unhinged by guilt, however, when the customer's wife expresses honest compassion for Ethan. He realizes that he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of their money.

Ethan comes back to the farm and picks up Mattie to take her to the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as a way of delaying their sad parting. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a bigelmtree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. The resulting crash leaves both of them alive, Ethan with a permanent limp and Mattie paralyzed from aspinal injury.

Returning to the present, the narrator tells of being forced by ablizzardto stay the night at the Frome house, the first stranger to enter the house in 20 years.  He witnesses an unhappy scene with Mattie and the Fromes living together, with Zeena as Mattie's caregiver. Ethan and Mattie have gotten their wish to stay together, but in mutual unhappiness and discontent, and ironically Mattie has now developed an irritable disposition, and the sickly Zeena is rising to the challenge of becoming a caretaker.  Zeena is a constant presence between the two of them, although it remains ambiguous as to whether she knew of their dalliance.

The story ofEthan Fromehad initially begun as a French-language composition that Wharton had to write while studying the language inParis,[2]but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is, basing her sense of New England culture and place on her ten years of living at The Mount, her home inLenox, Massachusetts. She would read portions of her novel-in-progress each day to her good friend Walter Berry, who was an international lawyer. Wharton likely based the story of Ethan and Mattie's sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox.[3]Five people total were involved in the real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Emily Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at theLenox Library. Kate Spencer suffered from a hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting.[3]Wharton found the notion of the tragic sledding crash to be irresistible as a potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of a secret love affair.

Lenox is also where Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with at least one of the victims of the accident; victims of the accident are buried in graves nearby Wharton family members. In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the ""outcroppinggranite"" ofNew England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. There are frequent references tolarch,elm, pine, andhemlocktrees.  The connection between land and people is very much a part ofnaturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield's winters.[4]

The New York TimescalledEthan Frome""a compelling and haunting story.""[5]Wharton was able to write an appealing book and separate it from her other works, where her characters inEthan Fromeare not of the elite upper class. However, the problems that the characters endure are still consistently the same, where the protagonist has to decide whether or not to fulfill their duty or follow their heart. She began writing Ethan Frome in the early 1900s when she was still married. The novel was criticized byLionel Trillingas lacking in moral or ethical significance.[2]Trilling wrote that the ending is ""terrible to contemplate,"" but that ""the mind can do nothing with it, can only endure it.""[6]

Jeffrey Lilburn notes that some find ""the suffering endured by Wharton's characters is quite bleak and makes for a dull read,"" but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it ""provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering."" Wharton was always careful to labelEthan Fromeas a brief reminiscence rather than a novel. Critics did take note of this when reviewing the book, some in more candor than others. Elizabeth Ammons reflected that reading Wharton's novel compelled her to reminisce upon when literature was more enthralling. She found a story that functions as a ""realistic social criticism,"" a reminder that some are willing to indulge in dull prose based solely upon the name of the author. Despite her obvious quarrels with the work, Ammons proceeded to analyze the text. The moral concepts, as described by Ammons, are revealed with all of the brutality of Starkfield's winters. Comparing Mattie Silver and Zeena Frome, Ammons suggests that Mattie would grow as frigid and crippled as Zeena, so long as such women remain isolated and dependent. Wharton cripples Mattie, says Lilburn, but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period.[7]

The book was adapted to the 1993film of the same name, directed byJohn Madden, and starringLiam Neeson,Patricia Arquette,Joan AllenandTate Donovan.[1]

Cathy Marstonadapted the book to a one-act ballet titledSnowblindfor theSan Francisco Ballet. The ballet premiered in 2018, with Ulrik Birkkjaer as Ethan,Sarah Van Pattenas Zeena andMathilde Frousteyas Mattie.[8]"

The Tale of Peter Rabbitwas first published in the United Kingdom byFrederick Warne & Co.as a small hardback book in October 1901; Potter created both the text and the illustrations.[2]The first edition had a print run of 250, with monochrome illustrations.[3]The demand was greater and she needed to print 200 more.[4]Warne published the first full-colour edition in 1902.[3]The blocks for the illustrations and text were sent to theprinterEdmund Evansforengraving, and Potter adjusted thepage proofs.[5]The book was soon on sale in shops in London, includingHarrodsdepartment store, accompanied by the world's firstlicensed character, a soft toy of Peter Rabbit.[3]By December 1903 the book had sold 50,000 copies.[6]The book's success prompted Warne to obtain more stories from Potter, starting in 1903 with bothThe Tailor of GloucesterandThe Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.[3]

The book has since been reprinted many times, and after 100 years had never gone out of print.[3][7]Warne did notcopyrightthe book when it was published in the United States;unlicensededitions of the book were produced, the first published byHenry Altemus Companyin 1904.[8]The book has been translated into 36 languages.[9]Over 45 million copies have been sold, making it one of thebest-selling booksin history.[10]

Scholars have identified a variety of themes inThe Tale of Peter Rabbit.[11]Eliza Dresang suggests that the book is ""radical"" in multiple ways. The first of these is its child-centred size, easy to hold. It is radical, too, in its nonlinear quality, with the images not immediately beside the text they illustrate (and sometimes before that text), and with sentences that often start with the result, and end with the actor, as in ""But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!"" The meaning, too, has more than one layer, not least in the dressed animals, which are at once experienced by the reader as animals and as humans. And the book's start, with the death of Peter Rabbit's father, is a radical innovation for a book for small children.[6]

Katie Mullins describes Peter's rebellious nature, which is seen in the book's first dialogue, when Mrs. Rabbit forbids Peter to go into Mr. McGregor's garden. Mullins comments that the garden is stated to be dangerous, as it is where Peter's father met his death. She cites Maria Nikolajeva and Carole Scott's description of Peter as a ""naughty boy who values his independence and whose desire to transgress boundaries far outweighs his mother's warnings or his personal safety"".[12][13]

Judith Robertson and colleagues examine the element of ruthlessness in the story. In their view, Peter Rabbit's qualities such as ruthlessness and defiance allow Potter to speak of her own self-knowledge; this serves both as an outlet for a woman in the strictVictorian era, and as a place for her young readers to imagine going to similar extremes.[14]

School Library Journalincluded the book at #19 on their Top 100 Picture Books list in 2012.[15]

Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the ""longevity of her books comes from strategy"", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.[16]She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.[17]

The scholar Margaret Mackey writes that Warne was still attempting to prevent other publishers from printingThe Tale of Peter Rabbitin 1993, despite the failure to protect the copyright 90 years earlier. In her view ""the battle has clearly been lost"", as multiple editions and formats exist in North America, and some ""even in Britain"" where the book was still protected at that time.[18]Some use both Potter's words and her illustrations, though sometimes too small to read. Warne itself has issued a large-format book,The Complete Adventures of Peter Rabbit, printing several of the original pages ""as panels on a larger page"". Mackey comments that this at once loses the subtlety of the original's layout andbook design.[18]In 1989, Warne further printedScenes from The Tale of Peter Rabbitwith ""five three-dimensional cut-out pictures from the book, tagged with quotations from the story.""[18]Among the seemingly-pirated editions, one by Ottenheimer Publishers in 1993 printed only a selection of the illustrations with the text, with larger but fewer pages. In Mackey's view, ""this version is simply an example of diminishment and loss"", as the rhythm of the original is dislocated.[18]Other editions dispense with Potter's text altogether, using a selection of her illustrations. One such is Warne'sMeet Peter Rabbit, a board book for babies with five pictures inside and one on the front cover, along with Beatrix Potter's name. The text ""barely mention[s] Mr. McGregor.""[18]

In 1938, shortly after the success ofSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,Walt Disneybecame interested in making an animated film based onThe Tale of Peter Rabbit. However, in a letter to a friend, Potter wrote that she refused Walt Disney's ""scheme to film Peter Rabbit"", saying, ""I am not very hopeful about the result. They propose to use cartoons; it seems that a succession of figures can be joggled together to give an impression of motion. I don't think the pictures would be satisfactory... I am not troubling myself about it!""[19]

In 1935, the story was loosely adapted in theMerrie Melodiesshort film,Country Boy. It shows some modifications in relation to Beatrix Potter's original story, most notably the Rabbit family surname is changed to ""Cottontail"" and Peter having two brothers and a sister rather than three sisters. In 1971, Peter Rabbit appeared as a character in theballetfilmThe Tales of Beatrix Potter. In late 1991,HBOaired an animated musical adaptation ofThe Tale of Peter Rabbit, narrated byCarol Burnett,[20]as part of the network'sStorybook Musicalsseries, which was later released to VHS byFamily Home Entertainmentunder HBO licence.[21]In 1992, the tale was adapted to animation again for theBBCanthology series,The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, along withThe Tale of Benjamin Bunny. In 2006, Peter Rabbit was heavily referenced in a biopic about Beatrix Potter entitledMiss Potter. In December 2012, a new animated children's TV series titledPeter Rabbitpremiered onNickelodeon, with a full series run beginning in February 2013.[22][23]

In February 2018, a live-action/animated feature film titledPeter Rabbit, directed byWill Gluck, was released. Voice roles were played byJames Corden,Daisy Ridley,Margot Robbie, andElizabeth Debicki, and live action roles played byDomhnall Gleeson,Rose Byrne, andSam Neill.[24]A sequelwas released in 2021.[25]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8525,"Eve's Diary, Complete",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve%27s_Diary,"It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the biblical creation story,Eve, and is claimed to be ""translated from the original MS.""  The ""plot"" of this story is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by her mateAdam, including meeting and getting to know him, and exploring the world around her,Eden.  The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden.

It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story ofAdam and Eve, includingExtracts from Adam's Diary, 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.'  ""Eve's Diary"" has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love.

The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wifeOlivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written.  Mark Twain is quoted as saying, ""'Eve's Diary' is finished — I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.""  The story ends with Adam lamenting at Eve's grave, ""Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.""

The book version of the story was published with 55 illustrations byLester Ralph, on each left hand page. The illustrations depicted Eve and Adam in their natural settings. The depiction of an unclothed woman was considered pornographic when the book was first released in the United States, and created a controversy around the book. A library inCharlton, Massachusettsbanned the book for the depictions of Eve in ""summer costume.""

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71865,Mrs. Dalloway,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Dalloway,"Clarissa Dalloway goes aroundLondonin the morning, getting ready to host a party that evening. The nice day reminds her of her youth spent in the countryside inBourtonand makes her wonder about her choice of husband; she had married the reliable, successful, Richard Dalloway instead of the enigmatic and demanding Peter Walsh. She ""had not the option"" to be with a female romantic interest, Sally Seton. Peter reintroduces these conflicts by paying a visit that morning. Peter's visit made it clear that he was still in love with Clarissa (despite mention of his new love interest, Daisy), and Clarissa expressed her desire for Peter to take her away. Clarissa additionally invites Peter to her party that evening.

Septimus Warren Smith, aFirst World Warveteran suffering fromdeferred traumatic stress, spends his day in the park with his Italian-born wife Lucrezia, who experiences majorlonelinessas a result of her husband's isolating illness. His going to war affected not only his ability to function, but Lucrezia's as well. Septimus is now visited by frequent and indecipherablehallucinations, mostly concerning his dear friend Evans, whom he had unresolved unrequited sexual feelings towards, and who died in thewar; otherwise Septimus seems to be unable to feel emotions for anyone, even his wife. Septimus's relationship with his physicians, Sir William Bradshaw and Dr Holmes, is extremely poor. He fears for his safety in the presence of both doctors and often questions human nature after their interactions. As a result of hisinvoluntary commitmentto apsychiatric hospitalhetakes his own life by jumping out of a window.

Clarissa's party in the evening is a slow success. It is attended by most of the characters she has met throughout the book, including Sally, Peter, and others from her past. Clarissa discovers that Sally, whom she has not seen for several decades, and who used to be a free-spirited tomboy, has become a respectable, matronly mother to five boys.

The novel ends with Clarissa hearing about Septimus's suicide at the party and gradually coming to admire this stranger's act, which she considers an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness. Clarissa also acknowledges her ability to relate to Septimus regardless of her limited knowledge of him.

InMrs Dalloway, all of the action, aside from theflashbacks, takes place on a day in ""the middle of June"" of 1923. It is an example ofstream of consciousnessstorytelling: every scene closely tracks the momentary thoughts of a particular character. Woolf blurs the distinction betweendirectandindirect speechthroughout the novel, freely alternating hermode of narrationbetweenomniscient description,indirectinterior monologue, andsoliloquy.[9]The narration follows at least twenty characters in this way, but the bulk of the novel is spent with Clarissa Dalloway, Peter Walsh, and Septimus Smith.

Woolf laid out some of her literary goals with the characters ofMrs Dallowaywhile still working on the novel. A year before its publication, she gave a talk at Cambridge University called ""Character in Fiction"", revised and retitled later that year as ""Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown"".[10]

Mrs Dallowayis commonly thought to be a response toJames Joyce'sUlysses. Both novels use the stream of consciousness technique to follow the thoughts of two characters, one older and one younger, during one day in a bustling city.[11]Woolf herself, writing in 1928, denied any deliberate ""method"" to the book, saying instead that the structure came about ""without any conscious direction"".[12]In her essay ""Modern Fiction"", Woolf praisedUlysses, writing of the chapter set at the cemetery (""Hades"") that, ""on a first reading at any rate, it is difficult not to acclaim a masterpiece"".[13]However, Woolf's private writings throughout her first reading ofUlyssesabound in hostile criticisms, as in this passage:

Woolf's disdain for Joyce's book only solidified after she finished reading it. She summed up her thoughts on the work as a whole:

TheHogarth Press, run by her and her husbandLeonard, had to turn down the chance to publishUlyssesin 1919 because of the obscenity law in England, as well as the practical issues regarding publishing such a substantial text.[16]

The novel has two main narrative lines involving two separate characters (Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith); within each narrative there is a particular time and place in the past that the main characters keep returning to in their minds. For Clarissa, her charmed youth at Bourton keeps intruding into her thoughts on this day in London. For Septimus, his time as a soldier during the ""Great War"" keeps intruding, especially in the form of Evans, his fallen comrade. Other characters, such as Peter Walsh, also find themselves returning to moments in their past.[17]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73,The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Badge_of_Courage,"On a cold day, the fictional 304th New York Infantry Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Private Henry Fleming, a young teenaged recruit, remembers his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother's resulting protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear or turn and run back. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henrydesertshis regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.

Ashamed, Henry escapes into a nearby forest, where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a ""tattered soldier"", asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group is Conklin, who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next comes upon a retreating column that is in disarray. In the panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.

The next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time. His regiment encounters an isolated Confederate unit, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he ""had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man"".[20]Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from his commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than ""mule drivers"" and ""mud diggers"". With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.

In the final battle, Henry acts as theflag-bearerafter the color sergeant falls. A line of Confederates, hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing, shoots with impunity at Henry's regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are takenprisoner. The novel closes with the following passage:

Although Crane once wrote in a letter, ""You can tell nothing ... unless you are in that condition yourself,"" he wroteThe Red Badge of Couragewithout any experience of war.[22]He would, however, later serve as awar correspondentduring theGreco-TurkishandSpanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield inThe Red Badge of Couragehas often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six years after the end of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: ""Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days"".[23]

Crane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle.Century's""Battles and Leaders"" series served as direct inspiration for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss's ""Recollections of a Private"") contains many parallels to Crane's work.[24]Thomas Beerwrote in his problematic 1923 biography[25]that Crane was challenged by a friend to writeThe Red Badge of Courageafter having announced that he could do better thanÉmile Zola'sLa Débâcle. This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated.[26]The metaphor of the ""red badge of courage"" itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officerPhilip Kearnyinsisted his troops wear bright redunit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery.[27]While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during theBattle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.[28]

It is believed that Crane listened to war stories in the town square ofPort Jervis, New York(where his family at times resided)[29]told by members of the124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms.[10]The Orange Blossoms first saw battle at Chancellorsville, which is believed by local historians to have been the inspiration for the battle depicted inThe Red Badge of Courage.[30]Furthermore, there was a Private James Conklin who served in the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment,[31]and Crane's short story ""The Veteran"", which was published inMcClure's Magazinethe year afterThe Red Badge of Courage,[32]depicts an elderly Henry Fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at Chancellorsville.[33]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59112,R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R.,"The play begins in a factory that makes artificial workers from synthetic organic matter. (As living creatures of artificial flesh and blood, that later terminology would callandroids, the playwright's 'roboti' differ from later fictional and scientific concepts of inorganic constructs.) Robots may be mistaken for humans but have no original thoughts. Though most are content to work for humans, eventually arebellioncauses the extinction of the human race.

Helena, the daughter of the president of a major industrial power, arrives at the island factory of Rossum's Universal Robots. Here, she meets Domin, the General Manager of R.U.R., who relates to her the history of the company. Rossum had come to the island in 1920 to studymarine biology. In 1932, Rossum had invented a substance like organic matter, though with a different chemical composition. He argued with his nephew about their motivations for creating artificial life. While the elder wanted to create animals to prove or disprove the existence of God, his nephew  only wanted to become rich. Young Rossum finally locked away his uncle in a lab to play with the monstrosities he had created and created thousands of robots. By the time the play takes place (circa the year 2000),[12]robots are cheap and available all over the world. They have become essential for industry.

After meeting the heads of R.U.R., Helena reveals that she is a representative of the League of Humanity, an organization that wishes to liberate the robots. The managers of the factory find this absurd. They see robots as appliances. Helena asks that the robots be paid, but according to R.U.R. management, the robots do not ""like"" anything.

Eventually Helena is convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money, but still argues robots have a ""soul"". Later, Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement.

Ten years have passed. Helena and her nurse Nana discuss current events, the decline in human births in particular. Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history, which has been shaped by the new worldwide robot-based economy. Helena meets Dr. Gall's new experiment, Radius. Dr. Gall describes his experimental robotess, also named Helena. Both are more advanced, fully-featured robots. In secret, Helena burns the formula required to create robots.  The revolt of the robots reaches Rossum's island as the act ends.

The characters sense that the very universality of the robots presents a danger. Echoing the story of theTower of Babel, the characters discuss whether creating national robots who were unable to communicate beyond their languages would have been a good idea. As robot forces lay siege to the factory, Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots.  The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions, despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of their choices.  Busman is killed while attempting to negotiate a peace with the robots. The robots storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist, the company's Clerk of the Works (Head of Construction). The robots spare him because they recognize that ""He works with his hands like a robot. He builds houses. He can work.""[13]

Years have passed. Alquist, who still lives, attempts to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed. He is a mechanical engineer, though, with insufficient knowledge ofbiochemistry, so he has made little progress. The robot government has searched for surviving humans to help Alquist and found none alive. Officials from the robot government beg him to complete the formula, even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other robots for it. Alquist yields. He will kill and dissect robots, thus completing the circle of violence begun in Act Two. Alquist is disgusted. Robot Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love. Playing a hunch, Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena; each begs him to take him- or herself and spare the other. Alquist now realizes that Primus and Helena are the newAdam and Eve, and gives the charge of the world to them.

The robots described in Čapek's play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton. They are not mechanical devices, but rather artificial
biological organisms that may be mistaken for humans. A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband, Harry Domin, because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess:

His robots resemble more modern conceptions of man-made life forms, such as theReplicantsinBlade Runner, the ""hosts"" in theWestworldTV seriesand the humanoidCylonsin the re-imaginedBattlestar Galactica, but in Čapek's time there was no conception of moderngenetic engineering(DNA's role inhereditywas not confirmed until 1952). There are descriptions of kneading-troughs for robot skin, great vats for liver and brains, and a factory for producing bones. Nerve fibers, arteries, and intestines are spun on factory bobbins, while the robots themselves are assembled like automobiles.[14]Čapek's robots are living biological beings, but they are stillassembled, as opposed togrownorborn.

One critic has described Čapek's robots as epitomizing ""the traumatic transformation of modern society by theFirst World Warand theFordistassembly line"".[14]

The play introduced the wordrobot, which displaced older words such as ""automaton"" or ""android"" in languages around the world.  In an article inLidové noviny, Karel Čapek named his brotherJosefas the true inventor of the word.[15][16]In Czech,robotameansforced labourof the kind thatserfshad to perform on their masters' lands and is derived fromrab, meaning ""slave"".[17]

The nameRossumis an allusion to the Czech wordrozum, meaning ""reason"", ""wisdom"", ""intellect"" or ""common sense"".[10]It has been suggested that the allusion might be preserved by translating ""Rossum"" as ""Reason"" but only the Majer/Porter version translates the word as ""Reason"".[11]

The work was published in two differing versions inPragueby Aventinum, first in 1920, followed by a revised version in 1921.[18]After being postponed, it premiered at the city'sNational Theatreon 25 January 1921, although an amateur group had by then already presented a production.[note 1]

By 1921,Paul Selvertranslated either the original 1920 edition ofR.U.R.or a manuscript copy close to this version into English.[note 2]He probably translated the play freelance, and sold it toSt Martin's TheatreinLondon. Selver's translation was adapted for the British stage byNigel Playfairin 1922, but it was not produced straight away. Later that year performance rights for the U.S. and Canada were sold to the New YorkTheatre Guild, perhaps duringLawrence Langner's visit to Britain. Playfair's version included several changes to Čapek's original play, such as renaming the acts (the prologue became act one, and the heavily abridged final act became the epilogue), omitting around sixty lines (including most of Alquist's final speech), adding several more lines, and removing the robot character Damon (giving his lines to Radius). The omission of some lines may have been censorship from theLord Chamberlain's Office, orself-censorshipin anticipation of this, while some other changes might have been made by Čapek himself if Selver was working from a manuscript copy.[note 3]An edition of Playfair's adaptation was published by theOxford University Pressin 1923, and Selver went on to write a satiric novelOne, Two, Three(1926) based on his experiences gettingR.U.R.staged.[18]

The American première was produced by the Theatre Guild at theGarrick Theatrein New York City in October 1922, where it ran for 184 performances. In the first performance, Domin was portrayed byBasil Sydney, Marius byJohn Merton, Hallemeier byMoffat Johnston, Alquist byLouis Calvert, Busman byHenry Travers, the robot Helena by antiwar activistMary Crane Honein her Broadway debut, and Primus byJohn Roche.[20][21]Spencer TracyandPat O'Brienplayed robots[which?]in theirBroadwaydebuts.[22]This production was based on Playfair's adaptation, thoughTheresa Helburnclaimed that, together with two Czechs, they closely compared his version against Čapek's original text, and that all changes from the original were made by the Theatre Guild as part of the rehearsal process.[18]Doubledaypublished this version of the play in 1923, though it omitted a change noted byJohn Corbinin theNew York Times, of the robot Helena holding a robot baby in the final scene.[23]

In April 1923Basil DeanproducedR.U.R.in Britain for the Reandean Company atSt Martin's Theatre, London.[24]This version was based on Playfair's adaptation, but omitted the characters Fabry and Hallemeier, and included several of the New York Theatre Guild revisions. TheBritish Libraryholds a typescript copy of this version of the play, which had been submitted by St Martin's Theatre to the Lord Chamberlain's Office two weeks before the play opened.[18]

In the 1920s, the play was performed in a number of American and British cities, including the Theatre Guild ""Road"" in Chicago and Los Angeles during 1923.[25]

In June 1923, Čapek sent a letter toEdward Marsh, with the final lines ofR.U.R.that had been omitted from the Selver/Playfair editions, which he described as being ""suppressed in [the] English version"".[note 4]This letter is held inSouthern Illinois University Carbondale'sMorris Library, along with an English translation of these lines, perhaps in Marsh's handwriting.[23]This translation was published in the journalScience Fiction Studies(2001).[18]A full translation of the final lines of the 1921 version of the play was published in the journalICarbS(1981).[23]

In 1989, a new, unabridged translation by Claudia Novack-Jones, based on Čapek's revised 1921 version, restored the elements of the play eliminated by Playfair.[18][26][27]Another unabridged translation was produced by Peter Majer and Cathy Porter forMethuen Dramain 1999.[11]: 260Anopen accessunabridged translation by David Wyllie was published by theUniversity of Adelaidein 2006,[28]and updated in 2014.[29]

In 2024,MIT Presspublished the bookR.U.R. and the Vision of Artificial Life,[30]which offered a new translation of the original 1920 edition by Štěpán Šimek. The book also contained a collection of essays reflecting on the play's legacy from scientists and scholars who work inartificial lifeand robotics.

Reviewing the New York production ofR.U.R.in 1922,The Forummagazine described the play as ""thought-provoking"" and ""a highly original thriller"".[31]John Clutehas laudedR.U.R.as ""a play of exorbitant wit and almost demonic energy"" and lists the play as one of the ""classic titles"" of inter-war science fiction.[32]Luciano Floridihas described the play thus: ""Philosophically rich and controversial,R.U.R.was unanimously acknowledged as a masterpiece from its first appearance, and has become a classic of technologically dystopian literature.""[33]Jarka M. Burien calledR.U.R.a ""theatrically effective, prototypal sci-fi melodrama"".[9]

On the other hand,Isaac Asimov, author of theRobotseriesof books and creator of theThree Laws of Robotics, stated: ""Čapek's play is, in my own opinion, a terribly bad one, but it is immortal for that one word. It contributed the word 'robot' not only to English, but through English, to all the languages in which science fiction is now written.""[4]In fact, Asimov's ""Laws of Robotics"" are specifically and explicitly designed to prevent the kind of situation depicted inR.U.R., since Asimov's robots are created with a built-in total inhibition against harming human beings or disobeying them.

Despite getting mostly positive responses, Čapek himself was very disappointed by critics' simplistic understanding of the play. He saw the play as part comedy, and ending with faith that humanity would survive albeit in a different form, while the critics often considered it to be pessimistic ornihilistic, and purely either an updatedFrankenstein, an anti-capitalist satire, or a critique of contemporary political ideologies. The critics' interpretation may have been influenced by how heavily abridged the final act (or Epilogue) was in the Selver/Playfair translation.[23]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2638,The Idiot,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot,"Prince Myshkin, a young man in his mid-twenties and a descendant of one of the oldest Russian lines of nobility, is on a train toSaint Petersburgon a cold November morning. He is returning to Russia having spent the past four years in a Swiss clinic for treatment of a severe epileptic condition. On the journey, Myshkin meets a young man of the merchant class, Parfyon Semyonovich Rogozhin, and is struck by his passionate intensity, particularly in relation to a woman—the dazzling society beauty Nastasya Filippovna Barashkova—with whom he is obsessed. Rogozhin has just inherited a very large fortune due to the death of his father, and he intends to use it to pursue the object of his desire. Joining in their conversation is a civil servant named Lebedyev—a man with a profound knowledge of social trivia and gossip. Realizing who Rogozhin is, Lebedyev firmly attaches himself to him.

The purpose of Myshkin's trip is to make the acquaintance of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Lizaveta Prokofyevna is the wife of General Epanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them he meets Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), the General's assistant. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastasya Filippovna. Totsky had been the orphaned Nastasya Filippovna's childhood guardian, but he had taken advantage of his position to groom her for his own sexual gratification. As a grown woman, Nastasya Filippovna has developed an incisive and merciless insight into their relationship. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Epanchin's eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastasya Filippovna, suspicious of Ganya and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision, but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, and he is particularly struck by the dark beauty of her face.

Myshkin makes the acquaintance of Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her three daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya. They are all very curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor on a wide variety of subjects—his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speak of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly ostracized and morally condemned. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastasya Filippovna.

The prince rents a room in the Ivolgin apartment, occupied by Ganya's family and another lodger called Ferdyschenko. There is much angst within Ganya's family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister (Varya), as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastasya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at the look on his face, his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya's rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. The tension is not eased by the entrance of Ganya's father, General Ivolgin, a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastasya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya's humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastasya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the ""shameless woman"". Ganya seizes his sister's arm, and she responds, to Nastasya Filippovna's delight, by spitting in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him violently in the face. Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastasya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya's mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles.

Among the guests at the party are Totsky, General Epanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's fiancé), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastasya Filippovna's approval, plays the role of cynical buffoon. With the help of Ganya's younger brother Kolya, the Prince arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastasya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted, Nastasya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastasya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Epanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastasya Filipovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastasya Filipovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.

For the next six months, Nastasya Filippovna remains unsettled and is torn between Myshkin and Rogozhin. Myshkin is tormented by her suffering, and Rogozhin is tormented by her love for Myshkin and her disdain for his own claims on her. Returning to Petersburg, the Prince visits Rogozhin's house. Myshkin becomes increasingly horrified at Rogozhin's attitude to her. Rogozhin confesses to beating her in a jealous rage and raises the possibility of cutting her throat. Despite the tension between them, they part as friends, with Rogozhin even making a gesture of concession. But the Prince remains troubled and for the next few hours he wanders the streets, immersed in intense contemplation. He suspects that Rogozhin is watching him and returns to his hotel where Rogozhin—who has been hiding in the stairway—attacks him with a knife. At the same moment, the Prince is struck down by a violent epileptic seizure, and Rogozhin flees in a panic.

Recovering, Myshkin joins Lebedyev (from whom he is renting a dacha) in the summer resort town Pavlovsk. He knows that Nastasya Filippovna is in Pavlovsk and that Lebedyev is aware of her movements and plans. The Epanchins, who are also in Pavlovsk, visit the Prince. They are joined by their friend Yevgeny Pavlovich Radomsky, a handsome and wealthy military officer with a particular interest in Aglaya. Aglaya, however, is more interested in the Prince, and to Myshkin's embarrassment and everyone else's amusement, she recites Pushkin's poem ""The Poor Knight"" in a reference to his noble efforts to save Nastasya Filippovna.

The Epanchins' visit is rudely interrupted by the arrival of Burdovsky, a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin's late benefactor, Pavlishchev. The inarticulate Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men. These include the consumptive seventeen-year-old Ippolit Terentyev, the nihilist Doktorenko, and Keller, an ex-officer who, with the help of Lebedyev, has written an article vilifying the Prince and Pavlishchev. They demand money from Myshkin as a ""just"" reimbursement for Pavlishchev's support, but their arrogant bravado is severely dented when Gavril Ardalionovich, who has been researching the matter on Myshkin's behalf, proves conclusively that the claim is false and that Burdovsky has been deceived. The Prince tries to reconcile with the young men and offers financial support anyway. Disgusted, Lizaveta Prokofyevna loses all control and furiously attacks both parties. Ippolit laughs, and Lizaveta Prokofyevna seizes him by the arm, causing him to break into a prolonged fit of coughing. But he suddenly becomes calm, informs them all that he is near death, and politely requests that he be permitted to talk to them for a while. He awkwardly attempts to express his need for their love, eventually bringing both himself and Lizaveta Prokofyevna to the point of tears. But as the Prince and Lizaveta Prokofyevna discuss what to do with the invalid, another transformation occurs and Ippolit, after unleashing a torrent of abuse at the Prince, leaves with the other young men. The Epanchins also leave, both Lizaveta Prokofyevna and Aglaya deeply indignant with the Prince. Only Yevgeny Pavlovich remains in good spirits, and he smiles charmingly as he says good-bye. At that moment, a magnificent carriage pulls up at the dacha, and the ringing voice of Nastasya Filippovna calls out to Yevgeny Pavlovich. In a familiar tone, she tells him not to worry about all the IOUs as Rogozhin has bought them up. The carriage departs, leaving everyone, particularly Yevgeny Pavlovich and the Prince, in a state of shock. Yevgeny Pavlovich claims to know nothing about the debts, and Nastasya Filippovna's motives become a subject of anxious speculation.

Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince visits the Epanchins at their dacha. He is beginning to fall in love with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastasya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastasya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares at her in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastasya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastasya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.

Myshkin follows the Epanchins back to their dacha, where eventually Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins to talk to him very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Epanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastasya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle has turned out to be completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastasya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya, and is seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.

They find that a large party has assembled at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyshchenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay is a painfully detailed description of the events and thoughts leading him to what he calls his 'final conviction': that suicide is the only possible way to affirm his will in the face of nature's invincible laws, and that consequently he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, are bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky, and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually he falls asleep and the party disperses.

The Prince wanders for some time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat appointed by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastasya Filippovna. They talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received, in which Nastasya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin. Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastasya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastasya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastasya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.

It is clear to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Epanchin that their daughter is in love with the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastasya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.

For a while the dinner party proceeds smoothly. Inexperienced in the ways of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to theRoman Catholic Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into an anti-Catholic tirade, claiming that it preaches theAntichristand in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor he begins waving his arms about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. As Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment, the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health. But it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time on the subject of the aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.

The next day Ippolit visits the Prince to inform him that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastasya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya's request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where both Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin are already present. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastasya Filippovna, and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastasya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks at him with pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastasya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.

In accordance with Nastasya Filippovna's wish, she and the Prince become engaged. Public opinion is highly critical of Myshkin's actions toward Aglaya, and the Epanchins break off all relations with him. He tries to explain to Yevgeny Pavlovich that Nastasya Filippovna is a broken soul, that he must stay with her or she will probably die, and that Aglaya will understand if he is only allowed to talk to her. Yevgeny Pavlovich refuses to facilitate any contact between them and suspects that Myshkin himself is mad.

On the day of the wedding, a beautifully attired Nastasya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastasya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not particularly surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him to come back to the house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastasya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study.

Rogozhin is sentenced to fifteen years hard labor in Siberia. Myshkin goes mad and, through the efforts of Yevgeny Pavlovich, returns to the sanatorium in Switzerland. The Epanchins go abroad and Aglaya elopes with a wealthy, exiled Polish count who later is discovered to be neither wealthy, nor a count, nor an exile—at least, not a political exile—and who, along with a Roman Catholic priest, has turned her against her family.

Prince Myshkin, the novel's central character, is a young man who has returned to Russia after a long period abroad where he was receiving treatment for epilepsy. The lingering effects of the illness, combined with his innocence and lack of social experience, sometimes create the superficial and completely false impression of mental or psychological deficiency. Most of the other characters at one time or another refer to him disparagingly as an ""idiot"", but nearly all of them are deeply affected by him. In truth he is highly intelligent, self-aware, intuitive, and empathic. He is someone who has thought deeply about human nature, morality and spirituality, and is capable of expressing those thoughts with great clarity.

Nastasya Filippovna, the main female protagonist, is darkly beautiful, intelligent, fierce, and mocking. She is an intimidating figure to most of the other characters. Of noble birth but orphaned at age 7, she was manipulated into a position of sexual servitude by her guardian, the voluptuary Totsky. Her broken innocence and the social perception of disgrace produce an intensely emotional and destructive personality. The Prince is deeply moved by her beauty and her suffering, and despite feeling that she is insane, remains devoted to her. She is torn between Myshkin's compassion and Rogozhin's obsession with her.

Rogózhin(Parfyón Semyónovich), who has just inherited a huge fortune from his merchant father, is madly in love with Nastasya Filippovna, and recklessly abandons himself to pursuing her. He instinctively likes and trusts the Prince when they first meet, but later develops a hatred for him out of jealousy. The character represents passionate, instinctive love, as opposed to Myshkin's Christian love based in compassion.[8]

Agláya Ivánovnais the radiantly beautiful youngest daughter of Myshkin's distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her husband, the wealthy and respected General Epanchin. Aglaya is proud, commanding, and impatient, but also full of arch humour, laughter, and innocence. The Prince is particularly drawn to her after the darkness of his time with Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin.

Ippolít Teréntyevis a youngnihilistintellectual who is in the final stages oftuberculosisand near death. Still full of youthful idealism, he craves love and recognition from others, but their indifference and his own morbid self-obsession lead him to increasing extremes of cynicism and defiance. The character is a ""quasi-double"" for Myshkin: their circumstances force them to address the same metaphysical questions, but their responses are diametrically opposed.[9]

A dialogue between the intimately related themes ofatheismand Christian faith (meaning, for Dostoevsky,Russian Orthodoxy) pervades the entire novel. Dostoevsky's personal image of Christian faith, formed prior to his philosophical engagement with Orthodoxy but never abandoned, was one that emphasized the human need for belief in theimmortality of the soul, and identifiedChristwith ideals of ""beauty, truth, brotherhood and Russia"".[11]The character of Prince Myshkin was originally intended to be an embodiment of this ""lofty (Russian) Christian idea"".[12]With the character's immersion in the increasingly materialistic and atheistic world of late 19th century Russia, the idea is constantly being elaborated, tested in every scene and against every other character. However, Myshkin's Christianity is not a doctrine or a set of beliefs but is something that he lives spontaneously in his relations with all others. Whenever he appears ""hierarchical barriers between people suddenly become penetrable, an inner contact is formed between them... His personality possesses the peculiar capacity to relativize everything that disunifies people and imparts afalse seriousnessto life.""[13]

The young nihilist Ippolit Terentyev is the character that provides the most coherent articulation of the atheist challenge to Myshkin's worldview, most notably in the long essay 'An Essential Explanation' which he reads to the gathering at the Prince's birthday celebration in part 3 of the novel.[14]Here he picks up a motif first touched upon early in part 2, in a dialogue between Myshkin and Rogozhin, when they are contemplating the copy ofHolbein'sDead Christin Rogozhin's house, and Rogozhin confesses that the painting is eroding his faith. Holbein's painting held a particular significance for Dostoevsky because he saw in it his own impulse ""to confront Christian faith with everything that negated it"".[15]The character of Ippolit argues that the painting, which depicts with unflinching realism the tortured, already putrefying corpse of Christ within the tomb, represents the triumph of blind nature over the vision of immortality in God that Christ's existence on Earth signified.[16]He is unable to share Myshkin's intuition of the harmonious unity of allBeing, an intuition evoked most intensely earlier in the novel in a description of the pre-epilepticaura.[17][18]Consequently, the inexorable laws of nature appear to Ippolit as something monstrous, particularly in the light of his own approaching death from tuberculosis:

The Prince does not directly engage with Ippolit's atheistic arguments, as a religious ideologist might: rather, he recognizes Ippolit as a kindred spirit, and empathetically perceives his youthful struggle with both his own inner negation and the cruelty, irony, and indifference of the world around him.[20][17]

The Prince's Christianity, insofar as he is the embodiment of the ""Russian Christian idea"", explicitly excludesRoman Catholicism. His unexpected tirade at the Epanchins' dinner party is based in unequivocal assertions that Roman Catholicism is ""an unChristian faith"", that it preaches the Antichrist, and that its appropriation and distortion of Christ's teaching into a basis for the attainment of political supremacy has given birth to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church, he claims, is merely a continuation of theWestern Roman Empire: cynically exploiting the person and teaching of Christ it has installed itself on the earthly throne and taken up the sword to entrench and expand its power. This is a betrayal of the true teaching of Christ, a teaching that transcends the lust for earthly power (Satan'sthird temptationto Christ), and speaks directly to the individual's and the people's highest emotions—those that spring from what Myshkin calls ""spiritual thirst"". Atheism and socialism are a reaction, born of profound disillusionment, to the Roman Catholic Church's defilement of its own moral and spiritual authority.[21]

It is because of this ""spiritual thirst"" that Myshkin is so uncompromisingly scathing about the influence of Roman Catholicism and atheism in Russia.[22]The Russian, he claims, not only feels this thirst with great urgency, but is, by virtue of it, particularly susceptible to false faiths:

The theme of the maleficent influence of Catholicism on the Russian soul is expressed, in a less obvious and polemical way, through the character of Aglaya Epanchin. Passionate and idealistic, like ""the Russian"" alluded to in the anti-Catholic diatribe, Aglaya struggles with theennuiof middle class mediocrity and hates the moral vacuity of the aristocracy to whom her parents kowtow. Her ""yearning for the exalted"" has attracted her to militant Catholicism, and in the Prince's devotion to Nastasya Filippovna she sees the heroism of aCrusader-Knight abandoning everything to go in to battle for his Christian ideal. She is deeply angry when, instead of ""defending himself triumphantly"" against his enemies (Ippolit and his nihilist friends), he tries to make peace with them and offers assistance.[22][24]Aglaya's tendency to misinterpret Myshkin's motives leads to fractures in what is otherwise a blossoming of innocent love. When the Epanchins go abroad after the final catastrophe, Aglaya, under the influence of a Roman Catholic priest, abandons her family and elopes with a Polish ""Count"".

In his notes Dostoevsky distinguishes the Prince from other characters of the virtuous type in fiction (such asDon QuixoteandPickwick) by emphasizing innocence rather than comicality.[25]In one sense Myshkin's innocence is an instrument of satire since it brings in to sharp relief the corruption and egocentricity of those around him. But his innocence is serious rather than comical, and he has a deeper insight into the psychology of human beings in general by assuming its presence in everyone else, even as they laugh at him, or try to deceive and exploit him.[26]Examples of this combination of innocence and insight can be found in Myshkin's interactions with virtually all the other characters.[27]He explains it himself in an episode with the roguish but 'honourable' Keller, who has confessed that he has sought the Prince out for motives that are simultaneously noble (he wants spiritual guidance) and mercenary (he wants to borrow a large sum of money from him). The Prince guesses that he has come to borrow money before he has even mentioned it, and unassumingly engages him in a conversation about the psychological oddity of 'double thoughts':

Aglaya Ivanovna, despite her occasional fury at his apparent passivity, understands this aspect of Myshkin's innocence, and expresses it in their conversation at the green seat when she speaks of the ""two parts of the mind: one that's important and one that's not important"".[29]

Nastasya Filippovna is a character who embodies the internal struggle between innocence and guilt. Isolated and sexually exploited by Totsky from the age of sixteen, Nastasya Filippovna has inwardly embraced her social stigmatization as a corrupted 'fallen woman', but this conviction is intimately bound to its opposite—the victimized child's sense of a broken innocence that longs for vindication. The combination produces a cynical and destructive outer persona, which disguises a fragile and deeply hurt inner being. When the Prince speaks to her, he addresses only this inner being, and in him she sees and hears the long dreamt-of affirmation of her innocence. But the self-destructive voice of her guilt, so intimately bound to the longing for innocence, does not disappear as a result, and constantly reasserts itself. Myshkin divines that in her constant reiteration of her shame there is a ""dreadful, unnatural pleasure, as if it were a revenge on someone.""[30]Its principal outward form is the repeated choice to submit herself to Rogozhin's obsession with her, knowing that its end result will almost certainly be her own death.[31]

The theme of the intrapsychic struggle between innocence and guilt is manifested, in idiosyncratic forms, in many of the characters in the novel. The character of General Ivolgin, for example, constantly tells outrageous lies, but to those who understand him (such as Myshkin, Lebedyev, and Kolya) he is the noblest and most honest of men.[32]He commits a theft out of weakness, but is so overcome by shame that it helps precipitate a stroke.[33]Lebedyev is constantly plotting and swindling, but he is also deeply religious, and is periodically overcome by paroxysms of guilt-ridden self-loathing. Myshkin himself has a strong tendency to feel ashamed of his own thoughts and actions. The fact that Rogozhin reaches the point of attacking him with a knife is something for which he feels himself to be equally guilty because his own half-conscious suspicions were the same as Rogozhin's half-conscious impulse.[34]When Burdovsky, who has unceremoniously demanded money from him on the basis of a falsehood, gets increasingly insulted by his attempts to offer assistance, Myshkin reproaches himself for his own clumsiness and lack of tact.[35]

In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to execution by firing squad for his part in the activities of thePetrashevsky Circle. Shortly after the period of interrogation and trial, he and his fellow prisoners were taken, without warning, to Semyonovsky Square where the sentence of death was read out over them. The first three prisoners were tied to stakes facing the firing squad: Dostoevsky was among the next in line. Just as the first shots were about to be fired, a message arrived from the Tsar commuting the sentences to hard labor in Siberia.

The experience had a profound effect on Dostoevsky, and in Part 1 ofThe Idiot(written twenty years after the event) the character of Prince Myshkin repeatedly speaks in depth on the subject ofcapital punishment. On one occasion, conversing with the Epanchin women, he recounts an anecdote that exactly mirrors Dostoevsky's own experience. A man of 27, who had committed a political offence, was taken to the scaffold with his comrades, where a death sentence by firing squad was read out to them. Twenty minutes later, with all the preparations for the execution having been completed, they were unexpectedly reprieved, but for those twenty minutes the man lived with the complete certainty that he was soon to face sudden death. According to this man, the mind recoils so powerfully against the reality of its imminent death that the experience of time itself is radically altered. The mind speeds up exponentially as the moment approaches, causing time to expand correspondingly, even reaching the point where the tiny amount of conventional human time left is experienced inwardly as unbearable in its enormity. Eventually, the man said, he ""longed to be shot quickly"".[36][37]

The subject of capital punishment first comes up earlier in Part 1, when the Prince is waiting with a servant for General Epanchin to appear. Engaging the servant in conversation, the Prince tells the harrowing story of an execution byguillotinethat he recently witnessed in France. He concludes the description with his own reflections on the horror of death by execution:

Later, when he is conversing with the Epanchin sisters, the Prince suggests to Adelaida, who has asked him for a subject to paint, that she paint the face of a condemned man a minute before the guillotine falls. He carefully explains his reasons for the suggestion, enters in to the emotions and thoughts of the condemned man, and describes in meticulous detail what the painting should depict. In this description Myshkin takes the contemplation of the condemned man's inward experience of time a step further and asks: what would the mind be experiencing in the last tenth of a second, as it hears the iron blade sliding above? And what would be experienced if, as some argue, the mind continues for some timeafterthe head has been cut off? The Prince breaks off without answering, but the implication is that the victim experiences these ""moments"" of unspeakable terror as vast stretches of time.[39][40]

In part 2, the usually comical character of Lebedyev also considers the horror of the moment before execution. In the midst of a heated exchange with his nihilist nephew he expresses deep compassion for the soul of theCountess du Barry, who died in terror on the guillotine after pleading for her life with the executioner.[41]

For much of his adult life Dostoevsky suffered from an unusual and at times extremely debilitating form oftemporal lobe epilepsy. In 1867 (the same year he began work onThe Idiot) he wrote to his doctor: ""this epilepsy will end up by carrying me off... My memory has grown completely dim. I don't recognize people anymore... I'm afraid of going mad or falling into idiocy"".[42]Dostoevsky's attacks were preceded by a brief period of intense joyous mystical experience which he described as being worth years of his life, or perhaps even his whole life. A similar illness plays an important part in the characterization of Prince Myshkin, partly because the severity of the condition and its after-effects (disorientation,amnesia,aphasia, among others) contributes significantly to the myth of the character's ""idiocy"".

Although Myshkin himself is completely aware that he is not an ""idiot"" in any pejorative sense, he sometimes concedes the aptness of the word in relation to his mental state during particularly severe attacks. He occasionally makes reference to the pre-narrative period prior to his confinement in a Swiss sanatorium, when the symptoms were chronic and he really was ""almost an idiot"".[43]Paradoxically, it is also clear that aspects of the disease are intimately connected to a profoundintensificationof his mental faculties, and are a significant cause of the development of his higher spiritual preoccupations:

Although for Myshkin these moments represented an intimation of the highest truth, he also knew that ""stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy stood before him as the consequence of these 'highest moments'."" At the end of the novel, after Rogozhin has murdered Nastasya Filippovna, the Prince appears to descend completely into this darkness.

The consciousness of the inevitability of death and the effect that this consciousness has on the living soul is a recurring theme in the novel. A number of characters are shaped, each according to the nature of their own self-consciousness, by their proximity to death. Most notable in this respect are Prince Myshkin, Ippolit, Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin.

The anecdote of the man reprieved from execution is an illustration, drawn from the author's own experience, of the extraordinary value of life as revealed in the moment of imminent death. The most terrible realization for the condemned man, according to Myshkin, is that of a wasted life, and he is consumed by the desperate desire for another chance. After his reprieve, the man vows to live every moment of life conscious of its infinite value (although he confesses to failing to fulfil the vow). Through his own emergence from a prolonged period on the brink of derangement, unconsciousness and death, the Prince himself has awoken to the joyous wonder of life, and all his words, moral choices and relations with others are guided by this fundamental insight. Joseph Frank, drawing on the theology ofAlbert Schweitzer, places the Prince's insight in the context of ""theeschatologicaltension that is the soul of the primitive Christian ethic, whose doctrine ofAgapewas conceived in the same perspective of the imminent end of time.""[45]Myshkin asserts that in the ecstatic moment of the pre-epileptic aura he is able to comprehend the extraordinary phrase (from theBook of Revelation, 10:6): ""there shall be time no longer"".[46]

Like Myshkin, Ippolit is haunted by death and has a similar reverence for the beauty and mystery of life, but his self-absorbed atheist-nihilist worldview pushes him toward opposite conclusions. While the Prince's worldview reflects the birth of his faith in a higher world-harmony, Ippolit's concern with death develops into a metaphysical resentment of nature's omnipotence, her utter indifference to human suffering in general and to his own suffering in particular. In the character of Ippolit, Dostoevsky again considers the terrible dilemma of the condemned man. Ippolit speaks of his illness as a ""death sentence"" and of himself as ""a man condemned to death"". In his ""Essential Explanation"" he argues passionately that meaningful action is impossible when one knows one is going to die. The living soul absolutely requires that its future be open, not pre-determined, and it rebels irrepressibly against the imposition of a definite end.[47][48]Ippolit conceives the idea of suicide as the only way left to him of asserting his will in the face of nature's death sentence.[49]

Dostoevsky's notebooks forThe Idiotduring the time of its serial publication clearly indicate that he never knew what successive installments would contain.[50]The method of testing the central idea in a series of extreme situations, allowing each character to freely respond, meant that there could be no pre-determined development of either plot or character: the author himself was just as surprised as the characters at what happened or didn't happen.[51]This uncontrived approach to writing becomes, in the novel, a depiction of what Morson calls ""the openness of time"". In the usual novel, the apparently free acts of the characters are an illusion as they only serve to bring about a future that has been contrived by the author. But in real life, even with a belief indeterminismorpreordination, the subject always assumes its freedom and acts as though the future were unwritten. Dostoevsky's extemporaneous approach helped facilitate the representation of the actual position of human subjectivity, as an open field of possibility where the will is free at all times, despite the apparent necessity of cause and effect.[52]According toMikhail Bakhtin, ""Dostoevsky always represents a personon the thresholdof a final decision, at a moment ofcrisis, at an unfinalizable—andunpredeterminable—turning point for their soul.""[53]

Bakhtin argues that Dostoevsky always wrote in opposition to modern tendencies toward the ""reificationof man""—the turning of human beings into objects (scientific, economic, social, etc.), enclosing them in an alien web of definition and causation, robbing them of freedom and responsibility.[54]""Carnivalization"" is a term used by Bakhtin to describe the techniques Dostoevsky uses to disarm this increasingly ubiquitous enemy and make true intersubjectivedialoguepossible. The concept suggests an ethos where normal hierarchies, social roles, proper behaviors and assumed truths are subverted in favor of the ""joyful relativity"" of free participation in the festival. InThe Idiot, everything revolves around the two central carnival figures of the ""idiot"" and the ""madwoman"", and consequently ""all of life is carnivalized, turned into a 'world inside out': traditional plot situations radically change their meaning, there develops a dynamic, carnivalistic play of sharp contrasts, unexpected shifts and changes"".[55]Prince Myshkin and Nastasya Filippovna are characters that inherently elude conventional social definition, or—as Bakhtin puts it—anything that might limit their ""pure humanness"". The carnival atmosphere that develops around them in each situation and dialogue (""bright and joyous"" in Myshkin's case, ""dark and infernal"" in Nastasya Filippovna's) allows Dostoevsky to ""expose a different side of life to himself and to the reader, to spy upon and depict in that life certain new, unknown depths and possibilities.""[56]

Carnivalization helps generate the artistic phenomenon that Bakhtin felt was unique to Dostoevsky in literature:Polyphony. Analogous tomusical polyphony, literary polyphony is the simultaneous presence of multiple independent voices, each with its own truth and validity, but always coincident with other voices, affecting them and being affected by them. Bakhtin defines it as ""the event of interaction between autonomous and internally unfinalized consciousnesses"".[57]In the polyphonic novel each character's voice speaks for itself: the narrator and even the author are present in the narrative merely as one voice among others. No voice has a privileged authority, and all have a form that inherently expresses engagement with other voices. Thus events unfolddialogically, as a consequence of the interaction between discrete voices, not as a consequence of authorial design:

Despite the appearance of omniscience, the narrator ofThe Idiotis given a distinct voice like any other character, and often conveys only a partial understanding of the events he is describing. It is the voice of a highly perceptive and meticulousreporter of the facts, who has, despite this objectivity, a particular perspective on what he is reporting, occasionally even lapsing into pontification. At one point in his notes Dostoevsky admonishes himself to ""write more concisely: only the facts. Write in the sense ofpeople say...""[59]The narrator's resort to 'the facts' has the effect of ""placing the facts on the side of rumor and mystery rather than on the side of description and explanation.""[60]The narrator is thus not omniscient, but a particular kind of insightful but limited spectator, and in the end he openly admits to the reader that the Prince's behaviour is inexplicable to him.[61]According to Frank, ""this limitation of the narrator is part of Dostoevsky's effort to present Myshkin's behaviour as transcendingallthe categories of worldly moral-social experience.""[62]

For Bakhtin the narrator's voice is another participant, albeit of a special kind, in the ""great dialogue"" that constitutes the Dostoevsky novel. All voices, all ideas, once they enter the world of the novel, take on an imaginary form that positions them in dialogical relationship with the other voices and ideas. In this sense, even the author's own ideological positions, when they are expressed through the narrator, or Myshkin, or Lebedyev, ""become thoroughly dialogized and enter the great dialogue of the novel oncompletely equal termswith the other idea-images"".[63]Since the most important thing for Dostoevsky in the construction of his novels is the dialogic interaction of a multiplicity of voices, the author's discourse ""cannot encompass the hero and his word on all sides, cannot lock in and finalize him from without. It can only address itself to him.""[64]

Critical reception ofThe Idiotat the time of its publication in Russia was almost uniformly negative. This was partly because a majority of the reviewers considered themselves to be opposed to Dostoevsky's ""conservatism"", and wished to discredit the book's supposed political intentions.[65]However the chief criticism, among both reviewers and general readers, was in the ""fantasticality"" of the characters.[66]The radical critic D.I. Minaev wrote: ""People meet, fall in love, slap each other's face—and all at the author's first whim, without any artistic truth.""[67]V.P. Burenin, a liberal, described the novel's presentation of the younger generation as ""the purest fruit of the writer's subjective fancy"" and the novel as a whole as ""a belletristic compilation, concocted from a multitude of absurd personages and events, without any concern for any kind of artistic objectivity.""[68]Leading radical criticMikhail Saltykov-Schedrinapproved of Dostoevsky's attempt to depict the genuinely good man, but castigated him for his scurrilous treatment of ""the very people whose efforts are directed at the very objective apparently pursued by him... On the one hand there appear characters full of life and truth, but on the other, some kind of mysterious puppets hopping about as though in a dream...""[69]Dostoevsky responded to Maykov's reports of the prevailing 'fantastical' criticisms with an unashamed characterization of his literary philosophy as ""fantastic realism"", and claimed that it was far more real, taking contemporary developments in Russia in to consideration, than the so-called realism of his detractors, and could even be used to predict future events.[66]

French and English translations were published in 1887, and a German translation in 1889. European critical response was also largely negative, mainly due to the novel's apparent formlessness and rambling style.[70]Morson notes that critics saw it as ""a complete mess, as if it were written extemporaneously, with no overall structure in mind—as, in fact, it was.""[71]Typical of the western critics was the introduction to the first French translation which, while praising the energetic style and characterization, notes that ""they are enveloped in a fantastic mist and get lost in innumerable digressions.""[72]

Prominent modern critics acknowledge the novel's apparent structural deficiencies, but also point out that the author was aware of them himself, and that they were perhaps a natural consequence of the experimental approach toward the central idea. Joseph Frank has calledThe Idiot""perhaps the most original of Dostoevsky's great novels, and certainly the most artistically uneven of them all,""[73]but he also wondered how it was that the novel ""triumphed so effortlessly over the inconsistencies and awkwardnesses of its structure."" Gary Saul Morson observes that ""The Idiotbrings to mind the old saw about how, according to the laws of physics, bumblebees should be unable to fly, but bumblebees, not knowing physics, go on flying anyway.""[71]

The twentieth century Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded the structural asymmetry and unpredictability of plot development, as well as the perceived ""fantasticality"" of the characters, not as any sort of deficiency, but as entirely consistent with Dostoevsky's unique and groundbreaking literary method.[74]Bakhtin saw Dostoevsky as the preeminent exemplar of theCarnivalesquein literature, and as the inventor of thepolyphonicnovel. A literary approach that incorporates carnivalisation and polyphony in Bakhtin's sense precludes any sort of conventionally recognizable structure or predictable pattern of plot development.

SinceThe Idiotwas first published inRussian, there have been a number of translations intoEnglish, including those by:

The Constance Garnett translation was for many years accepted as the definitive English translation, but more recently it has come under criticism for being dated. The Garnett translation, however, still remains widely available because it is now in the public domain. Some writers, such as Anna Brailovsky, have based their translations on Garnett's. Since the 1990s, new English translations have appeared that have made the novel more accessible to English readers.
TheOxford Guide to Literature in English Translation(2000) states that the Alan Myers version is the ""best version currently available"".[75]Since then, however, new translations by David McDuff and Pevear & Volokhonsky have also been well received."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2232,The Duchess of Malfi,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi,"Webster's principal source was inWilliam Painter'sThe Palace of Pleasure(1567), which was a translation ofFrançois de Belleforest's French adaptation ofMatteo Bandello'sNovelle(1554). Bandello had knownAntonio Beccadelli di Bolognain Milan before his assassination. He recounted the story of Antonio's secret marriage to Giovanna after the death of her first husband, stating that it brought down the wrath of her two brothers, one of whom,Luigi d'Aragona, was a powerful cardinal under Pope Julius II. Bandello says that the brothers arranged the kidnapping of the Duchess, her maid, and two of her three children by Antonio, all of whom were then murdered. Antonio, unaware of their fate, escaped to Milan with his oldest son, where he was later assassinated by a gang led by one Daniele Bozzolo.[5]

Webster's play follows this story fairly faithfully, but departs from the source material by depicting Bozzolo as a conflicted figure who repents, kills Antonio by mistake, then turns on the brothers killing them both.[6]In fact the brothers were never accused of the crime in their lifetimes and died of natural causes.

A vein of corruption runs throughout the play, notably in the character of the deadly Cardinal, a man ready to employ lesser beings (such as Bosola) to commit murders for him, then cast them aside as rotten fruit. He is no stranger to murder himself, however, as he slays his own mistress by making her kiss a poisoned bible. Antonio describes him thus:

The Cardinal gambles, keeps the wife of one of his courtiers as a mistress, and fights duels. Conspiracy and intrigue are the air he breathes. Duke Ferdinand is his brother's willing conspirator in villainy, and at times his rages shock even the Cardinal's sense of decorum. The Duke's corruption in the end destroys his sanity: incestuous desire for his own sister. Realizing she has married and borne children by Antonio, his rage drives him to do everything in his power to bring his sister to despair, madness and death, but in the end he is driven mad himself.

These two perverse villains destroy or poison all that is within their reach, all semblance of warmth or human affection.

The brothers repeatedly abuse their power. Ferdinand is caught committing adultery but is not punished. The Cardinal abuses his ecclesiastical powers to have Antonio's property confiscated and to have the Duchess and her family banished from the state of Ancona. Ferdinand and the Cardinal order the death of the Duchess without any proper judgement passed by a court of law.[7][unreliable source?]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140,The Jungle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle,"Jurgis Rudkus marries his sweetheart, Ona Lukoszaite, in a joyous traditional Lithuanian wedding feast. They and their extended family have recently immigrated to Chicago due to financial hardship inLithuania, then part of theRussian Empire. They have heard that America offers freedom and higher wages and have come to pursue theAmerican Dream.

Despite having lost much of their savings being conned on the trip to Chicago, and then having to pay for the wedding—and despite the disappointment of arriving at a crowded boarding house—Jurgis is initially optimistic about his prospects in Chicago. Young and strong, he believes that he is immune to the misfortunes that have befallen others in the crowd. He is swiftly hired by a meatpacking factory; he marvels at its efficiency, even while witnessing the cruel treatment of the animals.

The women of the family answer an ad for a four-room house. Ona, who came from an educated background, figures that they could easily afford it with the jobs that Jurgis, proud Marija, and ambitious Jonas have gotten. While they discover at the showing that the neighborhood is unkempt and the house doesn't live up to the advertisement, they are taken in by the slickness and fluentLithuanianof the real estate agent and sign a contract for the house.

However, with the help of an old Lithuanian neighbor, they discover several unexpected expenses in the contract that they must pay every month on time, or else faceeviction—the fate of most home buyers in the neighborhood. To meet these costs, Ona and thirteen-year-old Stanislovas (whom the family had wished to send to school) must take up work as well.

While sickness befalls them often, they cannot afford not to work. That winter, Jurgis's father, weakened by exposure to chemicals and the elements at his job, dies of illness.

Some levity is brought to their lives by the arrival of a musician, named Tamoszius, who courts Marija, and the birth of Jurgis and Ona's first child. However, this happiness is tempered when Ona must return to work one week after giving birth, and Marija is laid off in a seasonal cutback. Jurgis attends union meetings passionately; he realizes that he had been taken in by a vote-buying scheme when he was new to Chicago, learns that the meat factories deliberately use diseased meat, and furthermore that workers frequently come down with ailments related to their dangerous and unsanitary work.

Work becomes more demanding as wages fall; the working members of the family suffer a series of injuries. Amid this hardship, Jonas deserts the family, leaving them no choice but to send two children to work as newspaper boys. The youngest child, a handicapped toddler, dies of food poisoning; only his mother grieves his death.

After recovering from his injury, Jurgis takes the least desirable job at a fertilizer mill. In misery, he begins drinkingalcohol. He becomes suspicious of his pregnant wife's failure to return home on several nights. Ona eventually confesses that her boss, Phil Connor raped her, after which, by threatening to fire andblacklisteveryone in her family, he managed to coerce her into a continuingsexual relationship.

Jurgis furiously attacks Connor at his factory, but half a dozen men tear him away. While in prison awaiting trial, he realizes it is Christmas Eve. The next day, his cellmate, Jack Duane, tells him about his criminal ventures and gives him his address. At trial, Connor testifies that he had fired Ona for ""impudence"" and easily denies Jurgis's account; the judge dismissively sentences Jurgis to thirty days in prison plus court fees.

Stanislovas visits Jurgis in prison and tells him of the family's increasing destitution. After Jurgis serves his term (plus three days for his inability to pay the fees), he walks through the slush for an entire day to get home, only to find that the house had been remodeled and sold to another family. He learns from their old neighbor that, despite all of the sacrifices they had made, his family had been evicted and had returned to the boarding house.

Upon arriving at the boarding house, Jurgis heard Ona screaming. She is inpremature labor, and Marija explains that the family had no money for a doctor. Jurgis convinces amidwifeto assist, but it is too little too late; the infant is dead, and with one last look at Jurgis, Ona dies shortly afterward. The children return with a day's wages; Jurgis spends all of it to get drunk for the night.

The next morning, Ona's stepmother begs Jurgis to think of his surviving child. With his son in mind, he endeavors again to gain employment despite his blacklisting. For a time, the family gets by and Jurgis delights in his son's first attempts at speech. One day, Jurgis arrives home to discover that his son had drowned after falling off a rotting boardwalk into the muddy streets. Without shedding a tear, he walks away from Chicago.

Jurgis wanders the countryside while the weather is warm, working, foraging, and stealing for food, shelter, and drink. In the fall, he returns to Chicago, sometimes employed, sometimes atramp. While begging, he chances upon an eccentric rich drunk—the son of the owner of the first factory where Jurgis had worked—who entertains him for the night in his luxurious mansion and gives him aone-hundred-dollar bill(worth the equivalent of about $3,500 as of October 2024). Afterward, when Jurgis spends the bill at a bar, thebartendercheats him. Jurgis attacks the bartender and is sentenced to prison again, where he once again meets Jack Duane. This time, without a family to anchor him, Jurgis decides to fall in with him.

Jurgis helps Duane mug a well-off man; his split of the loot is worth over twenty times a day's wages from his first job. Though his conscience is pricked by learning of the man's injuries in the next day's papers, he justifies it to himself as necessary in a ""dog-eat-dog"" world. Jurgis then navigates the world of crime; he learns that this includes a substantial corruption of the police department. He becomes a vote fixer for a wealthy political powerhouse, Mike Scully, and arranges for many newSlavicimmigrants to vote according to Scully's wishes—as Jurgis once had. To influence those men, he had taken a job at a factory, which he continues as astrikebreaker. One night, by chance, he runs into Connor, whom he attacks again. Afterward, he discovers that his buddies cannot fix the trial as Connor is an important figure under Scully. With the help of a friend, he posts and skips bail.

With no other options, Jurgis returns to begging and chances upon a woman who had been a guest to his wedding. She tells him where to find Marija, and Jurgis heads to the address to find that it is abrothelbeing raided by the police. Marija tells him that she was forced to prostitute herself to feed the children after they had gotten sick, and Stanislovas—who had drunk too much and passed out at work—had been eaten by rats. After their speedy trial and release, Marija tells Jurgis that she cannot leave the brothel as she cannot save money and has become addicted to heroin, as is typical in the brothel'shuman trafficking.

Marija has a customer, so Jurgis leaves and finds a political meeting for a warm place to stay. He begins to nod off. A refined lady gently rouses him, saying, ""If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be interested."" Startled by her kindness and fascinated by her passion, he listens to the thundering speaker. Enraptured by his speech, Jurgis seeks out the orator afterward. The orator asks if he is interested insocialism.

A Polish socialist takes him into his home, conversing with him about his life and socialism. Jurgis returns home to Ona's stepmother and passionately converts her to socialism; she placatingly goes along with it only because it seems to motivate him to find work. He finds work in a small hotel that turns out to be run by a state organizer of the Socialist Party. Jurgis passionately dedicates his life to the cause of socialism.

Sinclair published the book in serial form between February 25, 1905, and November 4, 1905, inAppeal to Reason, thesocialistnewspaper that had supported Sinclair's undercover investigation the previous year. This investigation had inspired Sinclair to write the novel, but his efforts to publish the series as a book met with resistance. An employee atMacmillanwrote,

Five publishers rejected the work, deeming it too shocking for mainstream audiences.[6]Sinclair was about to self-publish a shortened version of the novel in a ""Sustainer's Edition"" for subscribers whenDoubleday, Pagecame on board. On February 28, 1906, the Doubleday edition was published simultaneously with Sinclair's. 5,000 appeared under the imprint of ""The Jungle Publishing Company"" with theSocialist Party’s symbol embossed on the cover, both using the same plates.[7]In the first six weeks, the book sold 25,000 copies.[8]

It has been in print ever since, including four more self-published editions, in 1920, 1935, 1942, 1945.[7]Sinclair dedicated the book ""To the Workingmen of America"".[9]

All works published in the United States before 1924 are in the public domain,[10]so there are free copies of the book available on websites such asProject Gutenberg[11]andWikisource.[12]

In 1988, St. Lukes Press, a division of Peachtree Publishers Ltd, published an edition titled ""The Lost First Edition of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle"" based on the original serialized version of ""The Jungle"" as seen in ""Appeal to Reason"". This version was edited by Gene Degruson of Pittsburg State University, based on a correspondence regarding the novel found in the basement of a farm inGirard, Kansas. The book included an introductory essay by DeGruson detailing the process of how he ""restored"" the text.[13]

In 2003,See Sharp Presspublished an edition based on the original serialization ofThe JungleinAppeal to Reason, which they described as the ""Uncensored Original Edition"" as Sinclair intended it. The foreword and introduction say that the commercial editions were censored to make their political message acceptable to capitalist publishers.[14]

Others argue that Sinclair had made the revisions of the original text himself, to make the novel more accurate and engaging for the reader, to correct the Lithuanian references, and to streamline the text to eliminate parts that would not appeal to the public, as Sinclair himself said in letters and his 1932 memoir,American Outpost.[7]

The publisher hyped the book.Isaac F. Marcossonhandled publicity. He sent the entire book in page proof to theAssociated Press, theUnited Press, and theHearstnewspaper chain, as well as to the managing editors of each of the leading big-city newspapers. He told them they were free to quote at length when the book was officially released.  TheMuckrakerpublishers and editors were hunting scandal and most newspapers responded eagerly with a sensational story that affected every reader.  In cities large and small all across the country the scandals were rehashed, often with page one coverage. The book sold tens of thousands of copies, and the newspapers reached millions.[15][16]The book produced a small fortune for Sinclair, who invested his early returns ina short-lived utopian settlement in New Jersey.[17]

The scandal brought Sinclair national fame.[18]He intended to expose ""the inferno of exploitation [of the typical American factory worker at the turn of the 20th Century]"",[19]but the reading public fixated on food safety as most pressing issue. Sinclair admitted his celebrity arose ""not because the public cared anything about the workers, but simply because the public did not want to eat tubercular beef"".[19]

Sinclair's account of workers falling intorenderingtanks and being ground along with animal parts into ""Durham's Pure Leaf Lard"" gripped the public—although it never happened.  Historians of the ethnic workers reject the  emphasis on their horrible lives and instead celebrate their successful rise in status and community building.[20][21][22][23]

The British politicianWinston Churchillpraised the book in a review.[24]Bertolt Brechttook up the theme of terrible working conditions at the Chicago Stockyards in his playSaint Joan of the Stockyards(German:Die heilige Johanna der Schlachthöfe), transportingJoan of Arcto that environment.

In 1933, the book became a target of theNazi book burningsdue to Sinclair's endorsement of socialism.[25]

PresidentTheodore Roosevelthad described Sinclair as a ""crackpot"" because of the writer's socialist positions.[26]He wrote privately to journalistWilliam Allen White, expressing doubts about the accuracy of Sinclair's claims: ""I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.""[27]

After readingThe Jungle, Roosevelt agreed with some of Sinclair's conclusions. The president wrote ""radical action must be taken to do away with the efforts of arrogant and selfish greed on the part of the capitalist.""[28]He assigned the Labor CommissionerCharles P. Neilland social worker James Bronson Reynolds to go to Chicago to investigate some meat packing facilities. Contemporary humorist Finley Peter Dunnesatirized Roosevelt's reaction,writing a story about the president being served sausages and subsequently throwing them out the window of the White House.[29]

Learning about the visit, owners had their workers thoroughly clean the factories prior to the inspection, but Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions. Their oral report to Roosevelt supported much of what Sinclair portrayed in the novel, excepting the claim of workers falling into rendering vats.[30]Neill testified before Congress that the men had reported only ""such things as showed the necessity for legislation.""[31]In 1906, theBureau of Animal Industryissued a report rejecting Sinclair's most severe allegations, characterizing them as ""intentionally misleading and false"", ""willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact"", and ""utter absurdity"".[32]

Roosevelt did not release the Neill–Reynolds Report for publication. His administration submitted it directly to Congress on June 4, 1906.[33]With powerful Republicans opposing reforms that would prove costly to the packers, a compromise deal was brokered by Roosevelt that gave the reformers much of what they wanted, but not all.[34]Public pressure led to the passage of theMeat Inspection Actand thePure Food and Drug Act. The latter established the Bureau of Chemistry, in 1930 renamed as theFood and Drug Administration.

Sinclair rejected the legislation, which he considered an unjustified boon to large meatpackers. The government and taxpayers would bear the costs of inspection, estimated at $30,000,000 annually.[35][36]In October 1906, he complained about the public's misunderstanding of the point of his book, inCosmopolitan Magazine, by saying, ""I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.""[37]

The firstfilm versionof the novel was made in 1914, but it has since beenlost.[38]

Saint Joan of the Stockyardsis a play set in Chicago written by the GermanmodernistplaywrightBertolt Brechtbetween 1929 and 1931, after the success of hismusicalThe Threepenny Operaand during the period of his radical experimental work with theLehrstücke. It is based on the musical that he co-authored withElisabeth Hauptmann,Happy End(1929).[39][40]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5230,The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man,"A man named Griffin arrives at an inn owned by Mr. and Mrs. Hall of the English village ofIping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a prosthetic nose. He is reclusive, irascible, unfriendly, and introverted. He demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. He causes a lot of accidents, but when Mrs. Hall addresses this, Griffin demands that the cost of the damage be put on his bill. While he is staying at the inn, hundreds of glass bottles arrive. His odd behaviour becomes the talk of the village, with many theorizing as to his origins.

Meanwhile, a burglary occurs in the village, but no suspect is found. Running short of money, Griffin is unable to pay for his lodging and meals. When his landlady threatens to kick him out, he reveals his invisibility to her in a fit of anger. An attempt to apprehend him by the police is thwarted when he undresses to take advantage of his invisibility, fights off his would-be captors, and flees.

At theSouth Downs, Griffin coerces a tramp, Thomas Marvel, to become his assistant. With Marvel, he returns to the village to recover three notebooks that contain records of his experiments. Marvel attempts to betray Griffin, who threatens to kill him. Marvel escapes to the seaside town of Port Burdock, pursued to an inn by Griffin, who is shot by one of the bar patrons.

Griffin takes shelter in a nearby house that turns out to belong to Dr. Kemp, a former acquaintance from medical school. To Kemp, he reveals his true identity: analbinoformer medical student who left medicine to devote himself to the science of optics.

Griffin tells the story of how he invented chemicals capable of rendering bodies invisible, which he first tried on a cat, then himself, how he burned down the boarding house he was staying in to cover his tracks, found himself ill-equipped to survive in the open, stole clothes from a theatrical supply shop onDrury Lane, and then headed to Iping to attempt to reverse the invisibility. Having been driven unhinged by the procedure and his experiences, Griffin now imagines that he can make Kemp his secret confederate, describing a plan to use his invisibility to terrorise the nation.

Kemp has already denounced Griffin to the local authorities, led by Port Burdock's chief of police, Colonel Adye, and waits for help to arrive while listening to this wild proposal. When Adye and his men arrive, Griffin fights his way out and the next day leaves a note announcing that Kemp will be the first man to be killed in the ""Reign of Terror"". Kemp tries to organise a plan to use himself as bait to trap the invisible man, but a note that he sends is stolen from his servant by Griffin. During the chase, Griffin arms himself with an iron bar and kills a bystander.[2]

Griffin shoots Adye, then breaks into Kemp's house. Adye's constables fend him off and Kemp bolts for the town, where the locals come to his aid. Still obsessed with killing Kemp, Griffin nearly strangles him but is cornered, seized, and beaten by the enraged mob, his last words a cry for mercy. Kemp urges the mob to stand away and tries to save Griffin's life, though unsuccessfully. Griffin's battered body becomes visible as he dies. A policeman has someone cover Griffin's face with a sheet.

It is later revealed that Marvel has secretly kept Griffin's notes and—with the help of the stolen money— becomes a successful businessman, running the ""Invisible Man Inn"". However, when not running his inn, Marvel tries to decipher the notes, hoping of one day recreating Griffin's work. However, because pages were accidentally washed clean, and the remaining notes are coded in Greek and Latin, and Marvel has no comprehension of even the basic mathematical symbols he sees in the notes, this is unlikely.[2]

According toJohn Sutherland, Wells and his contemporaries such asArthur Conan Doyle,Robert Louis StevensonandRudyard Kipling""essentially wrote boy's books for grown-ups."" Sutherland identifiesThe Invisible Manas one such book.[3]Wells said that his inspiration for the novella was ""The Perils of Invisibility"", one of theBab BalladsbyW. S. Gilbert, which includes the couplet ""Old Peter vanished like a shot/but then – his suit of clothes did not.""[4]Another influence onThe Invisible ManwasPlato'sRepublic, a book which had a significant effect on Wells when he read it as an adolescent. In the second book of theRepublic,Glauconrecounts the legend of theRing of Gyges, which posits that, if a man were made invisible and could act with impunity, he would ""go about among men with the powers of a god.""[5]Wells wrote the original version of the tale between March and June 1896. This version was a 25,000 wordshort storytitled ""The Man at the Coach and Horses"" with which Wells was dissatisfied, so he extended it.[6]

Russian writerYakov I. Perelmanpointed out inPhysics Can Be Fun(1962) that from a scientific point of view, a man made invisible by Griffin's method should have been blind because a human eye works by absorbing incoming light, not letting it through completely. Wells seems to show some awareness of this problem in Chapter 20, where the eyes of an otherwise invisible cat retain visible retinas. Nonetheless, this would be insufficient because the retina would be flooded with light (from all directions) that ordinarily is blocked by the opaquescleraof the eyeball. Also, any image would be badly blurred if the eye had an invisiblecorneaandlens."

Lady Bertram is Fanny’s aunt and her four children – Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia – are older than Fanny. All but Edmund mistreat her and her other aunt, Mrs Norris, wife of the clergyman at the Mansfield parsonage, makes herself particularly unpleasant.

When Fanny is fifteen, Aunt Norris is widowed and her visits to Mansfield Park increase, as does her mistreatment of Fanny. A year later, Sir Thomas leaves to deal with problems on his sugar plantation inAntigua, taking with him his spendthrift eldest son Tom. Mrs Norris, looking for a husband for Maria, finds the rich but weak-willed Mr Rushworth, whose proposal Maria accepts but only for his money.

Henry Crawfordand his sisterMaryarrive at the parsonage to stay with their half-sister, the wife of the new incumbent, Dr Grant. With their fashionable London ways, they enliven the great house. Edmund and Mary then start to show interest in one another.

On a visit to Mr Rushworth's estate, Henry flirts with both Maria and Julia. Maria believes Henry is in love with her and so treats Mr Rushworth dismissively, provoking his jealousy, while Julia struggles with jealousy and resentment towards her sister. Mary is disappointed to learn that Edmund will be a clergyman and tries to undermine his vocation.

After Tom returns to Mansfield Park ahead of his father, he encourages the young people to begin rehearsals for an amateur performance ofElizabeth Inchbald'splayLovers' Vows. Edmund objects, believing Sir Thomas would disapprove and feeling that the subject matter is inappropriate but, after much pressure, he agrees to take on the role of the lover of the character played by Mary. The play also provides further opportunity for Henry and Maria to flirt. When Sir Thomas arrives home unexpectedly, he is furious to find the play still in rehearsal and it is cancelled. Henry departs without explanation, and in reaction Maria goes ahead with marriage to Mr Rushworth. The couple then settle in London, taking Julia with them.

However, when Henry proposes marriage, Fanny rejects him, disapproving of his past treatment of women. Sir Thomas is astonished by her continuing refusal, but she does not explain, afraid of compromising Maria.

To help Fanny appreciate Henry's offer, Sir Thomas sends her to visit her parents in Portsmouth, where she is taken aback by the contrast between their chaotic household and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits, but although she still refuses him, she begins to appreciate his good features.

Later, Fanny learns that Henry and Maria have had an affair which is reported in the newspapers. Mr Rushworth sues Maria for divorce and the Bertram family is devastated. Tom meanwhile falls gravely ill. Edmund takes Fanny back to Mansfield Park, where she is a healing influence. Sir Thomas realises that Fanny was right to reject Henry's proposal and now regards her as a daughter.

During a meeting with Mary Crawford, Edmund discovers that Mary's regret is only that Henry's adultery was discovered. Devastated, he breaks off the relationship and returns to Mansfield Park, where he confides in Fanny. Eventually the two marry and move to Mansfield parsonage after Dr Grant secures a post in Westminster.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/910,White Fang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang,"The story begins before thewolf-dog hybridis born, with two men and theirsled dogteam on a journey to deliver the coffin of Lord Alfred to a remote town named Fort McGurry in the higher area of theYukon Territory. The men, Bill and Henry, are stalked by a large pack of starving wolves over the course of several days. Finally, after all of their dogs and Bill have been eaten, more teams find Henry escaping from the wolves; the wolf pack scatters when they hear the large group of people coming.

The story then follows the pack, which has been robbed of its last prey. When the pack finally brings down a moose, thefamineis ended; they eventually split up, and the story now follows a she-wolf and her mate, One Eye. One Eye claimed her after defeating and killing a younger rival. The she-wolf gives birth to alitterof five pups by theMackenzie River, and all but one die from hunger. One Eye is killed by alynxwhile trying to rob her den for food for the she-wolf and her pup; his mate later discovers his remains near the lynx's den. The surviving pup and the she-wolf are left to fend for themselves. Shortly afterward, the she-wolf kills all the lynx's kittens to feed her pup, prompting the lynx to track her down, and a vicious fight breaks out. The she-wolf eventually kills the lynx but suffers severe injury; the lynx carcass is devoured over a period of seven days as the she-wolf recovers from her injuries.

One day, the pup comes across fiveindigenouspeople, and the she-wolf comes to his rescue. One man, Grey Beaver, recognizes the she-wolf as his late brother's wolfdog, Kiche, who left during a famine. Grey Beaver's brother is dead, and so he takes Kiche and her pup and names the cub ""White Fang"". White Fang has a harsh life in the native camp; the current puppy pack, seeing him as a wolf, immediately attacks him. The Natives protect him, but the pups never accept him, and the pups' leader, Lip-Lip, singles him out for persecution. White Fang grows to become a savage, callous, morose, solitary, and deadly fighter, ""the enemy of his kind"".

It is at this time that White Fang is separated from his mother, who is sold off to another Native camp by Three Eagles. He earns the respect of Grey Beaver when he saves his son Mit-Sah from a group of boys seeking revenge for White Fang attacking one of them for trying to beat him for no reason. When a famine occurs, he runs away into the woods and encounters his mother Kiche, only for her to chase him away, for she has a new litter of cubs and has forgotten him. He also encounters Lip-Lip, whom he fights and kills before returning to the camp.

When White Fang is five years old, he is taken toFort Yukon, so that Grey Beaver can trade with the gold-hunters. There, a maliciousdog-fighternamed ""Beauty"" Smith connives to get Grey Beaver addicted to whiskey, and then when drunk sell White Fang to him. White Fang defeats all opponents pitted against him, including several wolves and a lynx, until abulldogcalled Cherokee is brought in to fight him. Cherokee has the upper hand in the fight when he grips the skin and fur of White Fang's neck and begins to throttle him. White Fang nearly suffocates, but is rescued when a rich mining expert, Weedon Scott, stops the fight, and forcibly buys White Fang from Beauty Smith.

Scott attempts to tame White Fang, and after a long, patient effort, he succeeds. When Scott attempts to return to California alone, White Fang pursues him, and Scott decides to take the dog with him back home. In Sierra Vista, White Fang must adjust to the laws of the estate. At the end of the book, an escaped convict, Jim Hall, tries to kill Scott's father, Judge Scott, for sentencing him to prison for a crime he did not commit, not knowing that Hall was ""railroaded"". White Fang kills Hall and is nearly killed himself, but survives. As a result, the women of Scott's estate name him ""The Blessed Wolf"". The story ends with White Fang relaxing in the sun with the puppies he has fathered with the sheep-dog Collie.

Major human characters:

Critics have identified many underlying themes in the novel. Tom Feller describes the story as ""an allegory of humanity's progression from nature to civilization"".[1]He also expresses that ""the [story's] implication is that the metamorphosis of both the individual and society will require violence at some point.""[1]Paul Deane states that ""[in the novel] society demands a conformity that undermines individualism.""[2]London himself took influence fromHerbert Spencer's words: ""survival of the fittest"", as well asFriedrich Nietzsche's idea of a ""superman"" (or ""superdog"", in this instance) and of ""the worship of power"".[1]

The novel is partly an autobiographicalallegorybased on London's conversion from teenage hoodlum to married, middle-class writer.[1]In writing it, he was influenced by the ideas ofHerbert Spencer,Karl Marx, andFriedrich Nietzsche.[1]Conditions in the US also influenced the story.[1]

Since the novel has been published it has been translated into over 89 different languages and released as a three-volumeBrailleedition.[3]

Upon its release,White Fangwas an immediate success worldwide,[4]and became especially popular among younger readers.[5]Robert Greenwood calledWhite Fang""one of London's most interesting and ambitious works.""[3]Virginia Crane claims that the novel is ""generally regarded as artistically inferior to its companion piece [The Call of the Wild], but [that it] helped establish London as a popular American literary figure"".[5]

Shortly after the book's publication, London became a target in what would later be called thenature fakers controversy, a literary debate highlighting the conflict between science and sentiment in popularnature writing. PresidentTheodore Roosevelt, who first spoke out against the ""sham naturalists"" in 1907, specifically named London as one of the so-called ""nature fakers"". Citing an example fromWhite Fang, Roosevelt referred to the fight between the bulldog and the wolfdog ""the very sublimity of absurdity.""[6]London only responded to the criticism after the controversy had ended. In a 1908 essay entitled ""The Other Animals"", he wrote:

The novel has been adapted into numerous pictures and sequels, animated specials, as well as an audiobook format.[4]A television series,White Fang, was filmed inArrowtown, New Zealand, in 1993."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2610,Notre-Dame de Paris,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame,"In 1482Paris, during the 21st year of the reign ofLouis XI, 10 years beforeChristopher Columbus landed in the Americas, sixteen-year-oldRomadancer Esmeralda is the romantic and sexual interest of many men, includingCaptain Phoebus de Chateaupers; poetPierre Gringoire; the deformed cathedral bell-ringerQuasimodo, and his guardianArchdeaconClaude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre-Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards. After he saves her, Esmeralda becomes infatuated with Phoebus. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, unwittingly wanders into the ""Court of Miracles"", populated by the Roma and the truands (beggars). They are about to hang him for beingan outsider, but Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him. She only does it to save his life, however, and much to Gringoire's annoyance, refuses to allow him to touch her.

The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on thepilloryfor two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.

Frollo learns from Gringoire, with whom he has a passing acquaintance, that Esmeralda has taught her pet goat, Djali, who sometimes performs with her on stage, to spell ""PHOEBUS"" using movable letters, and that she often whispers the name Phoebus when she thinks she is alone. Frollo suspects Phoebus may be a name. As it happens, Phoebus is a drinking companion of Frollo's dissolute younger brother, Jehan. After seeing them set out for a local tavern, Frollo follows them. He learns that Phoebus has arranged an assignation with Esmeralda at a local boarding-house, and follows Phoebus there. He observes the meeting from an adjoining room. Esmeralda begs Phoebus to marry her, but Phoebus only wants to lie with her, and eventually seduces her. Inflamed with jealousy, Frollo stabs Phoebus, though not fatally. Esmeralda briefly faints, though not before she has caught a glimpse of Frollo. When she recovers, Frollo has fled, and she is found near Phoebus' body. Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus and also withwitchcraft, and is sentenced to death by hanging. The prison's torturer hurts her so badly that she falsely confesses to Phoebus' murder. While imprisoned, awaiting her execution, Esmeralda is visited by Frollo. The Archdeacon professes his love for her and promises to help her escape if she reciprocates. However, recognising him as Phoebus' true attacker, she angrily rebuffs him. As Esmeralda is being led to thegallows, Quasimodo swings down from Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her – under thelaw of sanctuary– from arrest.

Frollo delves deeper into his obsession and gets frustrated with his plan failing. Upon seeing Esmeralda and Quasimodo when going to meet the latter, he grows jealous. That night he breaks into Esmeralda's cell with his master-key and attempts torapeher. Quasimodo intervenes and beats him, almost throwing him off the cathedral before the moonlight reveals his identity. Frollo kicks Quasimodo and declares to Esmeralda that if he cannot have her, no one shall.

Frollo later informs Gringoire that theCourt of Parlementhas voted to remove Esmeralda's right to sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be executed. Clopin Trouillefou, the leader of the Roma, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the Court of Miracles to charge Notre-Dame and rescue Esmeralda.

Quasimodo incorrectly assumes the approaching Roma intend to harm Esmeralda and drives them off. As Quasimodo defends the cathedral against the invaders, the uproar reaches the king, who is incorrectly informed that those attacking the cathedral are eager for Esmeralda's hanging rather than trying to rescue her. The king orders the authorities to dispatch the invaders and calls for Esmeralda's immediate execution to settle the unrest. In the chaos, Esmeralda is taken from the cathedral by Frollo and Gringoire.

The king's men come to Notre-Dame searching for Esmeralda. Quasimodo believes they intend to rescue her and helps them, meaning that if she had still been there, he would have inadvertently betrayed her.

Frollo once again attempts to win Esmeralda's love, but she asserts that she would rather die than be with him. Frollo goes to alert the authorities while trapping Esmeralda with Sister Gudule, a reclusiveanchoresswho bears anextreme hatred for the Roma, as she believes theycannibalisedher infant daughter. However, it is revealed that Gudule is really Esmeralda's birth mother and that Esmeralda is Gudule's long-lost daughter Agnes, abducted and raised by the Roma. The two women's joyous reunion is cut short when the king's men arrive to take Esmeralda to the gallows. A desperate Gudule clings to Esmeralda even as she is taken to the place of execution. The guards pull the old woman off her daughter, and she falls to the pavement and dies from the harsh impact.

From the tower of Notre-Dame, Frollo and Quasimodo witness as Esmeralda is hanged. Upon observing this, Quasimodo pushes the Archdeacon from the height of the cathedral to his death. With nothing left to live for, Quasimodo vanishes and is never seen again.

A deformed skeleton is found many years later embracing another in thecharnel houseatMontfaucon, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and laid down to die while holding her. As the guards attempt to pull the skeletons apart, his skeleton crumbles to dust.

The novel's original French title,Notre-Dame de Paris, indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story's themes.[6]The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays theRomanticera as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion.[citation needed]The theme ofdeterminism(fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word ""ANANKE"") is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.[7]

Architecture is a major concern of Hugo's inNotre-Dame de Paris, not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo's portentous phrase, ""Ceci tuera cela"" (""This will kill that"", as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that ""quiconque naissant poète se faisait architecte"" (""whoever was born a poet became an architect""), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.

With the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one's ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great art form. As with many of his books, Hugo was interested in a time that seemed to him to be on the cusp of two types of society.[8]

The major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired but these repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: ""And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows"" and ""...who substituted for the ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds"" are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is now uglier and worse than it was before the repair.

Hugo introduced with this work the concept of the novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists.

A significant aspect ofNotre-Dame de Parisis that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer rats, in a manner later used byHonoré de Balzac,Gustave Flaubertand many others, includingCharles Dickens. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouragedGothic revivalarchitecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led byEugène Viollet-le-Duc. Much of the cathedral's present appearance is a result of this renovation.

InThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame, Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of theprinting press, when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of ""the German pest"".

In 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life man called ""Hunchback"" who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the cathedral.[9]

The name Quasimodo has become synonymous with ""a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior"".[10]

To date, all the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in theclassic 1939 filmand the1996 Disney animated film. The1956 French filmis one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story. The Disney version has an ending that is inspired byan operacreated by Hugo himself.

Idris Elbais slated to not only play the title character but also to direct and produce music for a modern retelling to be broadcast onNetflix.[11]

A 1934 36-part serial adaptation created byGeorge Edwardswas broadcast on Australian radio.[18]

John Carradinestarred in an hour-long adaptation broadcast on a 1946 episode ofYour Playhouse of Favorites.[19]

The book was twice adapted and broadcast onBBC Radio 4'sClassic Serial:

Artists like Noel Gloesner,[23]Andrew Dickson,[24]Robin Recht,[25]Tim Conrad,[26]Gilbert Bloch,[27]George Evans[28]andDick Briefer[29]have all created comic strip and book adaptations ofThe Hunchback of Notre Dame. Paulo Borges,[30]Gustavo Machado[31]andDan Spiegle[32]have drawn comic strip and book versions based on the 1996 Disney movie adaptation.

The Hunchback of Notre-Damehas been translated into English many times. Translations are often reprinted in various imprints. Some translations have been revised over time.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1754,The Sea-Gull,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seagull,"Pyotr Sorin is a retired senior civil servant in failing health at his country estate. His sister, actress Irina Arkadina, arrives at the estate for a brief vacation with her lover, the writer Boris Trigorin. Pyotr and his guests gather at an outdoor stage to see an unconventional play that Irina's son, Konstantin Treplev, has written and directed. Theplay-within-a-playfeatures Nina Zarechnaya, a young woman who lives on a neighboring estate, as the ""soul of the world"" in a time far in the future. The play is Konstantin's latest attempt at creating anew theatrical form. It is a densesymbolistwork. Irina laughs at the play, finding it ridiculous and incomprehensible; the performance ends prematurely after audience interruption and Konstantin storms off in humiliation. Irina does not seem concerned about her son, who has not found his way in the world. Although others ridicule Konstantin's drama, the physician Yevgeny Dorn praises him.

Act I also sets up the play's variousromantic triangles. The schoolteacher Semyon Medvedenko loves Masha, the daughter of the estate's steward Ilya Shamrayev and his wife Polina Andryevna. However, Masha is in love with Konstantin, who is in love with Nina, but Nina falls for Trigorin. Polina is in an affair with Yevgeny. When Masha tells Yevgeny about her longing for Konstantin, Yevgeny helplessly blames the lake for making everybody feel romantic.

A few days later, in the afternoon, characters are outside the estate. Arkadina, after reminiscing about happier times, engages in a heated argument with the house steward Shamrayev and decides to leave. Nina lingers behind after the group leaves, and Konstantin arrives to give her agullthat he has shot. Nina is confused and horrified at the gift. Konstantin sees Trigorin approaching and leaves in a jealous fit.

Nina asks Trigorin to tell her about the writer's life; he replies that it is not an easy one. Nina says that she knows the life of an actress is not easy either, but she wants more than anything to be one. Trigorin sees the gull that Konstantin has shot and muses on how he could use it as a subject for a short story:

Arkadina calls for Trigorin, and he leaves as she tells him that she has changed her mind – they will be leaving immediately. Nina lingers behind, enthralled with Trigorin's celebrity and modesty, and gushes, ""My dream!""

Inside the estate, Arkadina and Trigorin have decided to depart. Between acts, Konstantin attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head, but the bullet only grazed hisskull. He spends the majority of Act III with his scalp heavily bandaged.

Nina finds Trigorin eating breakfast and presents him with a medallion that proclaims her devotion to him, using a line from one of Trigorin's own books: ""If you ever need my life, come and take it."" She retreats after begging for one last chance to see Trigorin before he leaves. Arkadina appears, followed by Sorin, whose health has continued to deteriorate. Trigorin leaves to continue packing. After a brief argument between Arkadina and Sorin, Sorin collapses in grief. He is helped by Medvedenko. Konstantin enters and asks his mother to change his bandage. As she is doing this, Konstantin disparages Trigorin, eliciting another argument. When Trigorin reenters, Konstantin leaves in tears.

Trigorin asks Arkadina if they can stay at the estate. She flatters and cajoles him until he agrees to return with her to Moscow. After she has left the room, Nina comes to say her final goodbye to Trigorin and to inform him that she is running away to become an actress against her parents' wishes. They kiss passionately and make plans to meet again in Moscow.

It is winter two years later, in thedrawing roomthat has been converted to Konstantin's study. Masha finally accepts Medvedenko's marriage proposal, and they have a child together, though Masha still nurses an unrequited love for Konstantin. Various characters discuss what has happened in the two years that have passed: Nina and Trigorin lived together in Moscow for a time until he abandoned her and went back to Arkadina. Nina gave birth to Trigorin's baby, but it died in a short time. Nina never achieved any real success as an actress, and she is currently on a tour of the provinces with a small theatre group. Konstantin has had some short stories published, but he is increasingly depressed. Sorin's health is still failing, and the people at the estate havetelegraphedfor Arkadina to come for his final days.

Most of the play's characters go to the drawing room to play a game ofbingo. Konstantin does not join them, instead working on a manuscript at his desk. After the group leaves to eat dinner, Konstantin hears someone at the back door. He is surprised to find Nina, whom he invites inside. Nina tells Konstantin about her life over the last two years. Konstantin says that he followed Nina. She starts to compare herself to the gull that Konstantin killed in Act II, then rejects that and says ""I am an actress."" She tells him that she was forced to tour with a second-rate theatre company after the death of the child she had with Trigorin, but she seems to have a newfound confidence. Konstantin pleads with her to stay, but she is in such disarray that his pleading means nothing. She embraces Konstantin and leaves. Despondent, Konstantin spends two minutes silently tearing up his manuscripts before leaving the study.

The group reenters and returns to the bingo game. There is a sudden gunshot from off-stage, and Dorn goes to investigate. He returns and takes Trigorin aside. Dorn tells Trigorin to somehow get Arkadina away, for Konstantin has just shot himself.

The first night ofThe Seagullon 17 October1896at theAlexandrinsky Theatrein Petersburg was a disaster, booed by the audience. The hostile audience intimidatedVera Komissarzhevskayaso severely that she lost her voice. Some considered her the best actor in Russia who, according to Chekhov, had moved people to tears as Nina in rehearsal.[2]The next day, Chekhov, who had taken refuge backstage for the last two acts, announced toSuvorinthat he was finished with writing plays.[5]When supporters assured him that later performances were more successful, Chekhov assumed they were just being kind.The Seagullimpressed the playwright and friend of ChekhovVladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, however, who said Chekhov should have won theGriboyedovprize that year forThe Seagullinstead of himself.[6]"

He exclusively uses plural pronouns (""we"", ""our"", ""they"") to refer to himself and others. He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes: the Home of Infants from birth until five years old, then the Home of Students from five to fifteen. He believes he has a ""curse"" that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. He excels at the Science of Things and dreams of becoming a Scholar, but when the Council of Vocations assigns his Life Mandate at fifteen, he is assigned to be a Street Sweeper.

Equality 7-2521 accepts his street sweeping assignment as penance for his Transgression of Preference in secretly desiring to be a Scholar. He works with the handicapped Union 5-3992 and International 4-8818, the latter of whom is Equality 7-2521's only friend (which is another Transgression of Preference, because all are supposedly equal in their society). Despite International 4-8818's protests that any exploration unauthorized by a Council is forbidden, Equality 7-2521 explores an underground tunnel near the City Theatre tent, and finds metal tracks. Equality 7-2521 believes the tunnel is from the Unmentionable Times of the distant past. He begins sneaking away from his community at night to use the tunnel as a laboratory for scientific experiments, using garbage he has taken from the Home of the Scholars. He is using stolen paper from the Home of the Clerks to write his journal by candlelight, using candles stolen from the larder at the Home of the Street Sweepers.

While cleaning a road at the edge of the city, Equality 7-2521 meetsLiberty 5-3000, a 17-year-old Peasant girl who works in the fields. He commits another transgression by thinking constantly of her, instead of waiting to be assigned a woman at the annual Time of Mating, in which men aged twenty and over, and women of eighteen and over, are assigned to each other solely for breeding. She has dark eyes and golden hair, and he names her ""The Golden One"". When he speaks to her, he discovers that she also thinks of him. He reveals his secret name for her, and Liberty 5-3000 tells Equality 7-2521 she has named him ""The Unconquered"".

Continuing his scientific work, Equality 7-2521 rediscoverselectricity. In the ruins of the tunnel, he finds a glass box with wires that gives off light when he passes electricity through it. He decides to take his discovery to the World Council of Scholars; he thinks such a great gift to mankind will outweigh his many transgressions and lead to him being made a Scholar. However, one night, his absence from the Home of the Street Sweepers is noticed. He is whipped and held in the Palace of Corrective Detention. The night before the World Council of Scholars is set to meet, he easily escapes; there are no guards because no one has ever attempted escape before. The next day, he presents his work to the World Council of Scholars. Horrified that he has done unauthorized research, they assail him as a ""wretch"" and a ""gutter cleaner"" and say he must be punished. They want to destroy his discovery so it will not disrupt the plans of the World Council and the Department of Candles. Equality 7-2521 seizes the box, cursing the council before fleeing into the Uncharted Forest that lies outside the city.

In the forest, Equality 7-2521 sees himself as damned for having left his fellow men, but he enjoys his freedom. No one will pursue him into this forbidden place. He only misses Liberty 5-3000. On his second day of living in the forest, Liberty 5-3000 appears; she followed him into the forest and vows to stay with him forever. They live together in the forest and try to express their love for one another, but they lack the words to speak of love as individuals.

They find a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains and decide to live in it. While reading books from the house's library, Equality 7-2521 discovers the word ""I"" and tells Liberty 5-3000 about it. Her first words to him are, “I love you.” Having rediscovered individuality, they give themselves new names from the books: Equality 7-2521 becomes ""Prometheus"" and Liberty 5-3000 becomes ""Gaea"". Months later, Gaea is pregnant with Prometheus's child. Prometheus wonders how men in the past could have given up their individuality; he plans a future in which they will regain it.

Ayn Rand initially conceivedAnthemas a play when she was a teenager living inSoviet Russia.[1]After migrating to the United States, Rand did not plan to writeAnthem, but she reconsidered after reading a short story inThe Saturday Evening Postset in the future.[a]Seeing that mainstream magazines would publishspeculative fiction, she decided to try submittingAnthemto them. She wrote the story in the summer of 1937, while taking a break from research she was doing for her next novel,The Fountainhead.[3]

Rand's working title wasEgo.Leonard Peikoffexplains the meaning behind this title: ""[Rand] is (implicitly) upholding the central principles of her philosophy and of her heroes: reason, values, volition, individualism."" Thinking that the original title was too blunt, unemotional, and would give away too much of the theme, Rand changed the title toAnthem. ""The present novel, in Miss Rand's mind, was from the outset an ode to man's ego. It was not difficult, therefore, to change the working title: to move from 'ego' to 'ode' or 'anthem', leaving the object celebrated by the ode to be discovered by the reader.""[4]

There are similarities betweenAnthemand the 1921 novelWebyYevgeny Zamyatin, another author who had lived in Communist Russia. These include:

There are also a number of differences between the two stories. For example, the society ofWeis in no scientific or technological decay, featuring X-rays, airplanes, microphones, and so on. In contrast, the people ofAnthembelieve that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it, and that bleeding people is a decent form of medicine. The similarities have led to speculation about whether Rand's story was directly influenced by Zamyatin's.[5][6]However, there is little evidence that Rand was influenced by or even read Zamyatin's work, and she never mentioned it in discussions of her life in Russia.[5][7]

Initially, Rand planned on publishingAnthemas a magazine story or serial, but her agent encouraged her to publish it as a book. She submitted it simultaneously toMacmillan Publishersin America andCassellin England. Both had handled her previous novel,We the Living.[8]Cassell agreed to publishAnthem, but Macmillan declined it. According to Peikoff, ""[Macmillan's] comment was: the author does not understand socialism.""[9]Another American publisher also turned it down, and Rand's agent was unable to sell it as a magazine serial. Cassell published it in England in 1938.[10]

After the success ofThe Fountainhead, a revised edition ofAnthemwas published in the US in 1946 byPamphleteers, Inc., a smalllibertarian-oriented publishing house owned by Rand's friendsLeonard ReadandWilliam C. Mullendore.[11]A 50th Anniversary Edition was published in 1995, including an appendix which reproduces the Cassell edition with Rand's handwritten editorial changes.

Since its publication in 1946, the revised version ofAnthemhas sold more than 3.5 million copies.[12]

The original UK edition received mostly positive reviews; several praised Rand's imagination and her support of individualism.[13]InThe Sunday Times, reviewerDilys Powellcomplimented its ""simplicity and sincerity"". Anti-communist journalistMalcolm Muggeridgegave a mixed review inThe Daily Telegraph, saying it had appeal, but its dystopia was not believable.[13]A short review byMaurice RichardsoninThe Observersaid it was ""highly unconvincing, in spite of some extremely eloquent writing"".[14]

Reviewing the 1953 American first hardcover edition for a genre audience,Anthony BoucherandJ. Francis McComaswere unsympathetic. Saying that ""Rand implies that a sinister conspiracy of purveyors of brotherhood has prevented its American publication until now"", they ironically concluded, ""One can only regret that the conspiracy finally broke down.""[15](Caxton Press offered this first U.S. edition in boards in 1953, while thepulp magazineFamous Fantastic Mysteriesincluded reprints of bothFranz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" andAnthemin the magazine's final, June 1953 issue.)

The Libertarian Futurist Society awardedAnthemitsHall of Fame Awardin 1987.[16]In 2014,Anthemwas nominated for aRetrospective Hugo Awardfor ""Best Novella"".[17]

Following the release ofAnthemin the United States, Rand explored opportunities for having it adapted to other media. She had discussions about potential film, opera, and ballet adaptations, but these projects were never realized.[18]In 1946, Rand wrote toWalt Disneythat if a screen adaptation were possible, ""I would like to see it done in stylized drawings, rather than with living actors.""[19]

In 1950, a radio adaptation was done forThe Freedom Story, a weekly radio program produced by Spiritual Mobilization, a Christian libertarian group.[20]In 2011, it was released as an unabridged audiobook by ABN, the narration by Jason McCoy described as 'stirring and evocative'.[21]

In 1991,Michael Paxtonwrote, directed, and co-produced a stage adaptation ofAnthem, which appeared at the Lex Theater inHollywood.[22]The book was adapted into a stage play in 2013 byJeff Britting, the department manager of the Ayn Rand Archives at theAyn Rand Institute. First performed in Denver, it openedOff-Broadwayin September 2013 at theJerome Robbins Theater.The New York Timesreview stated, ""For a play that celebrates the individual,Anthemsure doesn’t trust its audience. Instead of illustrating ideas, this sporadically interesting show too often delivers exposition, desperate to overexplain rather than risk a moment of misunderstanding.""[23]The novella also inspired a spoof rock musical, premiering Off-Broadway at the Lynn Redgrave Theatre in May 2014. The cast included Randy Jones ofThe Village People, Jason Gotay, Jenna Leigh Green, Remy Zaken, and Ashley Kate Adams.[24]The review inThe New York Timescriticized the acting of the leads, but called the show ""exuberant"" and better than a straight adaptation.[25]

In 2011,Anthemwas adapted into agraphic novelby Charles Santino, with artwork byJoe Staton.[26]In 2018, a second graphic novel adaptation was produced, unrelated to the 2011 adaptation, adapted by Jennifer Grossman andDan Parsons.[27]

The work has inspired manymusical pieces, including full-length albums. According toEnzo Stuarti,Pat Boonecomposed the lyrics and his friendFrank Lovejoywrote the, quoting Stuarti, ""Prelude to this next offering,"" of ""The Exodus Song"", featured in the albumStuarti Arrives at Carnegie Hall. The song begins with a line right out ofAnthem. In another point of the song it reads: ""...I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my land, and my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom."" InAnthem, it reads: ""...I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my land, my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom."" A memo to Rand dated May 4, 1964, mentions the unauthorized adaptation, but there is no indication that she took any legal action.[28]

Robert Silverberg's 1971 novelA Time of Changesalso depicts a society whereIis a forbidden word and where the protagonist rebels against this prohibition. In a 2009 preface to a reprint edition of his novel, Silverberg said he had readAnthemin 1953, but had long forgotten it when he wroteA Time of Changes. He was surprised to see the similarities when he rediscovered Rand's story, but said overall the two books are very different.[29]

Anthemis also credited byNeil Peartfor influencingRush's ""2112"" with strong parallels to the plot, structure, and theme ofAnthem. Peart has said that although he readAnthem, he was not consciously thinking of the story when he wrote the song; however when he recognized there were similarities, he gave credit to ""the genius of Ayn Rand"" in the liner notes.[30]The band also released a song called ""Anthem"" on theirFly by Nightalbum, and their Canadian record label (co-founded by Rush managerRay Danniels) isAnthem Records.

Among Rand's works,Anthemis one of the most commonly assigned as secondary school reading.[31]The Ayn Rand Institute provides free copies of the novel for use in schools, and holds an annualAnthemessay contest for students.[32]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70891,Notre-Dame de Paris - Tome 1 (French),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame,"In 1482Paris, during the 21st year of the reign ofLouis XI, 10 years beforeChristopher Columbus landed in the Americas, sixteen-year-oldRomadancer Esmeralda is the romantic and sexual interest of many men, includingCaptain Phoebus de Chateaupers; poetPierre Gringoire; the deformed cathedral bell-ringerQuasimodo, and his guardianArchdeaconClaude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre-Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards. After he saves her, Esmeralda becomes infatuated with Phoebus. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, unwittingly wanders into the ""Court of Miracles"", populated by the Roma and the truands (beggars). They are about to hang him for beingan outsider, but Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him. She only does it to save his life, however, and much to Gringoire's annoyance, refuses to allow him to touch her.

The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on thepilloryfor two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.

Frollo learns from Gringoire, with whom he has a passing acquaintance, that Esmeralda has taught her pet goat, Djali, who sometimes performs with her on stage, to spell ""PHOEBUS"" using movable letters, and that she often whispers the name Phoebus when she thinks she is alone. Frollo suspects Phoebus may be a name. As it happens, Phoebus is a drinking companion of Frollo's dissolute younger brother, Jehan. After seeing them set out for a local tavern, Frollo follows them. He learns that Phoebus has arranged an assignation with Esmeralda at a local boarding-house, and follows Phoebus there. He observes the meeting from an adjoining room. Esmeralda begs Phoebus to marry her, but Phoebus only wants to lie with her, and eventually seduces her. Inflamed with jealousy, Frollo stabs Phoebus, though not fatally. Esmeralda briefly faints, though not before she has caught a glimpse of Frollo. When she recovers, Frollo has fled, and she is found near Phoebus' body. Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus and also withwitchcraft, and is sentenced to death by hanging. The prison's torturer hurts her so badly that she falsely confesses to Phoebus' murder. While imprisoned, awaiting her execution, Esmeralda is visited by Frollo. The Archdeacon professes his love for her and promises to help her escape if she reciprocates. However, recognising him as Phoebus' true attacker, she angrily rebuffs him. As Esmeralda is being led to thegallows, Quasimodo swings down from Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her – under thelaw of sanctuary– from arrest.

Frollo delves deeper into his obsession and gets frustrated with his plan failing. Upon seeing Esmeralda and Quasimodo when going to meet the latter, he grows jealous. That night he breaks into Esmeralda's cell with his master-key and attempts torapeher. Quasimodo intervenes and beats him, almost throwing him off the cathedral before the moonlight reveals his identity. Frollo kicks Quasimodo and declares to Esmeralda that if he cannot have her, no one shall.

Frollo later informs Gringoire that theCourt of Parlementhas voted to remove Esmeralda's right to sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be executed. Clopin Trouillefou, the leader of the Roma, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the Court of Miracles to charge Notre-Dame and rescue Esmeralda.

Quasimodo incorrectly assumes the approaching Roma intend to harm Esmeralda and drives them off. As Quasimodo defends the cathedral against the invaders, the uproar reaches the king, who is incorrectly informed that those attacking the cathedral are eager for Esmeralda's hanging rather than trying to rescue her. The king orders the authorities to dispatch the invaders and calls for Esmeralda's immediate execution to settle the unrest. In the chaos, Esmeralda is taken from the cathedral by Frollo and Gringoire.

The king's men come to Notre-Dame searching for Esmeralda. Quasimodo believes they intend to rescue her and helps them, meaning that if she had still been there, he would have inadvertently betrayed her.

Frollo once again attempts to win Esmeralda's love, but she asserts that she would rather die than be with him. Frollo goes to alert the authorities while trapping Esmeralda with Sister Gudule, a reclusiveanchoresswho bears anextreme hatred for the Roma, as she believes theycannibalisedher infant daughter. However, it is revealed that Gudule is really Esmeralda's birth mother and that Esmeralda is Gudule's long-lost daughter Agnes, abducted and raised by the Roma. The two women's joyous reunion is cut short when the king's men arrive to take Esmeralda to the gallows. A desperate Gudule clings to Esmeralda even as she is taken to the place of execution. The guards pull the old woman off her daughter, and she falls to the pavement and dies from the harsh impact.

From the tower of Notre-Dame, Frollo and Quasimodo witness as Esmeralda is hanged. Upon observing this, Quasimodo pushes the Archdeacon from the height of the cathedral to his death. With nothing left to live for, Quasimodo vanishes and is never seen again.

A deformed skeleton is found many years later embracing another in thecharnel houseatMontfaucon, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and laid down to die while holding her. As the guards attempt to pull the skeletons apart, his skeleton crumbles to dust.

The novel's original French title,Notre-Dame de Paris, indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story's themes.[6]The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays theRomanticera as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion.[citation needed]The theme ofdeterminism(fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word ""ANANKE"") is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.[7]

Architecture is a major concern of Hugo's inNotre-Dame de Paris, not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo's portentous phrase, ""Ceci tuera cela"" (""This will kill that"", as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that ""quiconque naissant poète se faisait architecte"" (""whoever was born a poet became an architect""), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.

With the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one's ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great art form. As with many of his books, Hugo was interested in a time that seemed to him to be on the cusp of two types of society.[8]

The major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired but these repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: ""And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows"" and ""...who substituted for the ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds"" are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is now uglier and worse than it was before the repair.

Hugo introduced with this work the concept of the novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists.

A significant aspect ofNotre-Dame de Parisis that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer rats, in a manner later used byHonoré de Balzac,Gustave Flaubertand many others, includingCharles Dickens. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouragedGothic revivalarchitecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led byEugène Viollet-le-Duc. Much of the cathedral's present appearance is a result of this renovation.

InThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame, Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of theprinting press, when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of ""the German pest"".

In 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life man called ""Hunchback"" who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the cathedral.[9]

The name Quasimodo has become synonymous with ""a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior"".[10]

To date, all the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in theclassic 1939 filmand the1996 Disney animated film. The1956 French filmis one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story. The Disney version has an ending that is inspired byan operacreated by Hugo himself.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote,"For Cervantes and the readers of his day,Don Quixotewas a one-volume book published in 1605, divided internally into four parts, not the first part of a two-part set. The mention in the 1605 book of further adventures yet to be told was totally conventional, did not indicate any authorial plans for a continuation, and was not taken seriously by the book's first readers.[14]

Cervantes, in ametafictionalnarrative, writes that the first few chapters were taken from ""the archives of La Mancha"", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by theMoorishhistorianCide Hamete Benengeli.

Alonso Quixanois ahidalgonearing 50 years of age who lives in a deliberately unspecified region ofLa Manchawith his niece and housekeeper. While he lives a frugal life, he is full of fantasies about chivalry stemming from his obsession with chivalric romance books. Eventually, his obsession becomes madness when he decides to become aknight errant, donning an old suit of armor. He renames himself ""Don Quixote"", names his old workhorse ""Rocinante"", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo (a slaughterhouse worker with a famed hand for salting pork) hislady love, renaming herDulcinea del Toboso.

As he travels in search of adventure, he arrives at an inn that he believes to be a castle, calls the prostitutes he meets there ""ladies"", and demands that the innkeeper, whom he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. The innkeeper agrees. Quixote starts the night holdingvigilat the inn's horse trough, which Quixote imagines to be a chapel. He then becomes involved in a fight withmuleteerswho try to remove his armor from the horse trough to water their mules. In a pretend ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.

Quixote next encounters a servant named Andres who is tied to a tree and being beaten by his master over disputed wages. Quixote orders the master to stop the beating, untie Andres and swear to treat his servant fairly. However, the beating is resumed, and redoubled, as soon as Quixote leaves.

Quixote then chances upon traders fromToledo. He demands that they agree that Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world. One of them demands to see her picture so that he can decide for himself. Enraged, Quixote charges at them but his horse stumbles, causing him to fall. One of the traders beats up Quixote, who is left at the side of the road until a neighboring peasant brings him back home.

While Quixote lies unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parishcurate, and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books, seeing them as the root of his madness. They seal up the library room, later telling Quixote that it was done by a wizard.

Don Quixote asks his neighbour, the poor farm labourerSancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship. Sancho agrees and they sneak away at dawn. Their adventures together begin with Quixote's attack on some windmills which he believes to be ferocious giants. They next encounter two Benedictinefriarsand, nearby, an unrelated lady in a carriage. Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who are holding the lady captive, knocks one of them from his horse, and is challenged by an armedBasquetravelling with the company. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and begging him not to harm the Basque.

After a friendly encounter with some goatherds and a less friendly one with someYanguesanporters drivingGalician ponies, Quixote and Sancho enter an inn owned by Juan Palomeque, where a mix-up involving a servant girl's romantic rendezvous with another guest results in a brawl. Quixote explains to Sancho that the inn is enchanted. They decide to leave, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed in the air by several mischievous guests at the inn before he manages to follow.

After further adventures involving a dead body, a barber's basin that Quixote imagines as the legendary helmet ofMambrino, and a group ofgalley slaves, they wander into theSierra Morena. There they encounter the dejected and mostly mad Cardenio, who relateshis story. Inspired by Cardenio, Quixote decides to imitate what he has read in his chivalric romances and live like a hermit in a display of devotion to Dulcinea. He sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village. They make a plan to trick Quixote into coming home, recruiting Dorotea, a woman they discover in the forest, to pose as the Princess Micomicona, a damsel in distress.

The plan works and Quixote and the group return to the inn, though Quixote is now convinced, thanks to a lie told by Sancho when asked about the letter, that Dulcinea wants to see him. At the inn, several other plots intersect and are resolved. Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Quixote does battle with somewineskinswhich he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomicona's kingdom. An officer of theSanta Hermandadarrives with a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves, but the priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees and Quixote is locked in a cage which he is made to think is an enchantment. He has a learned conversation with a Toledocanonhe encounters by chance on the road, in which the canon expresses his scorn for untruthful chivalric books, but Don Quixote defends them. The group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, before he is finally brought home.

The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.

Although the two parts are now published as a single work,Don Quixote, Part Twowas a sequel published ten years after the original novel. In an early example ofmetafiction, Part Two indicates that several of its characters have read the first part of the novel and are thus familiar with the history and peculiarities of the two protagonists.

Don Quixote and Sancho are on their way to El Toboso to meet Dulcinea, with Sancho aware that his story about Dulcinea was a complete fabrication. They reach the city at daybreak and decide to enter at nightfall. However, a bad omen frightens Quixote into retreat and they quickly leave. Sancho is instead sent out alone by Quixote to meet Dulcinea and act as a go-between. Sancho's luck brings three peasant girls along the road and he quickly tells Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting and as beautiful as ever. Since Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho goes on to pretend that an enchantment of some sort is at work.

A duke and duchess encounter the duo. These nobles have read Part One of the story and are themselves very fond of books of chivalry. They decide to play along for their own amusement, beginning a string of imagined adventures and practical jokes. As part of one prank, Quixote and Sancho are led to believe that the only way to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets his promised governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler before all ends in humiliation. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.

Quixote battles the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Quixote's hometown who had earlier posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach inBarcelona. Defeated, Quixote submits to prearranged chivalric terms: the vanquished must obey the will of the conqueror. He is ordered to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for a period of one year, by which time his friends and relatives hope he will be cured.

On the way back home, Quixote and Sancho ""resolve"" the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Upon returning to his village, Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully become Alonso Quixano once more. Sancho tries to restore his faith and his interest in Dulcinea, but Quixano only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry.

After Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.

Don Quixote, Part Onecontains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of thepicaresquefigures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is ""El Curioso Impertinente"" (The Ill-Advised Curiosity), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of aFlorentinenobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity and talks his close friendLothariointo attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.

InPart Two, the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions inPart Oneand promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, ""Part Two"" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.

Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.[15]

Thestory within a storyrelates that, for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates; an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.

One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: When Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.

Later, the maid's lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen, and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife's affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish. Lothario is killed in battle soon afterward and Camilla dies of grief.

The novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming inDon Quixotemakes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the namesRocinante[16](a reversal) andDulcinea(an allusion to illusion), and the wordquixoteitself, possibly a pun onquijada(jaw) but certainly[17][18]cuixot(Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse'srump.[19]

As a military term, the wordquijoterefers tocuisses, part of a full suit ofplate armourprotecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix-otedenotes the augmentative—for example,grandemeans large, butgrandotemeans extra large, with grotesque connotations. Following this example,Quixotewould suggest 'The Great Quijano', an oxymoronic play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.[20]

Cervantes wrote his work inEarly Modern Spanish, heavily borrowing fromOld Spanish, the medieval form of the language. The language ofDon Quixote, although still containingarchaisms, is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of thePoema de mio Cid, a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language asMiddle Englishis fromModern English. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.

InDon Quixote, there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource—he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that drove him to madness; and many times when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote useKing James Bibleor Shakespearean English, or evenMiddle English.)[21][22]

In Old Castilian, the letterxrepresented the sound writtenshin modern English, so the name was originally pronounced[kiˈʃote]. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, asound changecaused it to be pronounced with avoiceless velar fricative[x]sound (like theScotsorGermanch), and today the Spanish pronunciation of ""Quixote"" is[kiˈxote]. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such asAsturian,Leonese,Galician,Catalan,Italian,Portuguese,TurkishandFrench, where it is pronounced with a ""sh"" or ""ch"" sound; the French operaDon Quichotteis one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.

Today, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation ofQuixote(Quijote), as/kiːˈhoʊti/,[1]although the traditional Englishspelling-based pronunciationwith the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in/ˈkwɪksət/or/ˈkwɪksoʊt/. InAustralian English, the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was/ˈkwɪksət/until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to ""anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly"".[23]The traditional English rendering is preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival formquixotic, i.e.,/kwɪkˈsɒtɪk/,[24][25]defined byMerriam-Websteras the foolishly impractical pursuit of ideals, typically marked by rash and lofty romanticism.[26]

Harold BloomsaysDon Quixoteis the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war withFreud'sreality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying. Bloom says that the novel has an endless range of meanings, but that a recurring theme is the human need to withstand suffering.[27]

Edith Grossman, who wrote and published a highly acclaimed[28]English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:

The novel's structure isepisodicin form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, asingenioso(Spanish) means ""quick with inventiveness"",[30]marking the transition of modern literature fromdramaticto thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.

Althoughburlesqueon the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works byPablo PicassoandRichard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat diddy, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.

Even faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire oforthodoxy, veracity and even nationalism.[citation needed]In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped lead literary practice beyond the narrow convention of thechivalric romance. Hespoofsthe chivalric romance[31]through a straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to theknightly virtuesof the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the wordquixoticwas quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed,Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase ""tilting at windmills"" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.

It stands in a unique position between medievalromanceand the modern novel. The former consists of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through ""having read his adventures"", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more ""Alonso Quixano the Good"".

The cave ofMedrano[32](also known as thecasa de Medrano) inArgamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Miguel de Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write his famous work ""Don Quixote de la Mancha.""[33][34][35][36][37][38][39]

Sources forDon Quixoteinclude the Castilian novelAmadis de Gaula, which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, isTirant lo Blanch, which the priest describes in Chapter VI ofQuixoteas ""the best book in the world."" (However, the sense in which it was ""best"" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called ""the most difficult passage ofDon Quixote"".) The scene of the book burning provides a list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.

Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poemOrlando furioso. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet ofMambrino, an episode from Canto I ofOrlando, and itself a reference toMatteo Maria Boiardo'sOrlando innamorato.[40]The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 ofOrlando, regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.[41]

Another important source appears to have been Apuleius'sThe Golden Ass, one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale ""The Curious Impertinent"" in chapter 35 of the first part ofDon Quixoteis a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.[42]Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.

Cervantes' experiences as agalley slavein Algiers also influencedQuixote.[43]

Medical theories may have also influenced Cervantes' literary process. Cervantes had familial ties to the distinguished medical community. His father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, and his great-grandfather, Juan Díaz de Torreblanca, were surgeons. Additionally, his sister, Andrea de Cervantes, was a nurse.[44]He also befriended many individuals involved in the medical field, in that he knew medical author Francisco Díaz, an expert in urology, and royal doctorAntonio Ponce de Santa Cruzwho served as a personal doctor to both Philip III and Philip IV of Spain.[45]

Apart from the personal relations Cervantes maintained within the medical field, Cervantes' personal life was defined by an interest in medicine. He frequently visited patients from the Hospital de Inocentes in Sevilla.[44]Furthermore, Cervantes explored medicine in his personal library. His library contained more than 200 volumes and included books likeExamen de Ingenios, byJuan HuarteandPractica y teórica de cirugía, by Dionisio Daza Chacón that defined medical literature and medical theories of his time.[45]

Researchers Isabel Sanchez Duque and Francisco Javier Escudero have found that Cervantes was a friend of the family Villaseñor, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acuña. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road fromEl TobosotoMiguel Estebanin 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of ""hidalgo"", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.[46][47]

It is not certain when Cervantes began writingPart TwoofDon Quixote, but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. In about September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitledSecond Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate)Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, ofTordesillas, was published inTarragonaby an unidentifiedAragonesewho was an admirer ofLope de Vega, rival of Cervantes.[48]It was translated intoEnglishby William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.

Some modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda's book in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that Cervantes encountered it, which may have been much earlier.

Avellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes'sSegunda Partelend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.

In his introduction toThe Portable Cervantes,Samuel Putnam, a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version ""one of the most disgraceful performances in history"".[49]

The second part of Cervantes'Don Quixote, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics[50]as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes'sSegunda Parte, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda'sSecond Partbeing printed there, in an early example ofmetafiction.[51]Don Quixote and Sancho Panza also meet one of the characters from Avellaneda's book, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and make him swear that the ""other"" Quixote and Sancho are impostors.[52]

Cervantes' story takes place on the plains ofLa Mancha, specifically thecomarcaofCampo de Montiel.

The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence ofDon Quixotehas been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6087,The Vampyre; a Tale,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampyre,"Aubrey meets the mysterious Lord Ruthven at a social event when he comes to London. After briefly getting to know Ruthven, Aubrey agrees to go travelling around Europe with him. Aubrey slowly realizes that Ruthven delights in causing the ruin and degradation of others, and after Ruthven attempts to seduce the daughter of a mutual acquaintance near Rome, Aubrey leaves in disgust. Alone, Aubrey travels to Greece where he falls in love with an innkeeper's daughter, Ianthe. She tells him about the legends of the vampire, which are very popular in the area, and Aubrey recognises that Ruthven fits the physical description.

This romance is short-lived: Ianthe is killed, her throat torn open by an attacker who injures Aubrey and leaves behind an unusual dagger. The whole town believes it to be the work of an evil vampire. Aubrey falls ill, but is found and nursed back to health by Ruthven. Although suspicious of the man, Aubrey feels obliged to Ruthven and rejoins him in his travels. The pair are attacked by bandits on the road and Ruthven is mortally wounded. On his deathbed, Ruthven makes Aubrey swear an oath that he will not speak of Ruthven or his death for a year and a day, and once Aubrey agrees, Lord Ruthven dies laughing. Amongst Ruthven's belongings Aubrey discovers a sheath which matches the dagger found by Ianthe's body.

Aubrey returns to London and is amazed when Ruthven appears shortly thereafter, alive and well. Ruthven reminds Aubrey of his oath and although Aubrey wants to warn others of Ruthven's character he feels unable to break his oath. Helpless to protect his sister from Ruthven, Aubrey has a nervous breakdown. Upon recovering, Aubrey learns that Ruthven has inherited an earldom and is engaged to his sister, and they are due to be married on the day that his oath will end. Unable to delay the wedding, Aubrey has a stroke. That night, his oath expires, and Aubrey relates the entire story before dying. But it is too late: Ruthven has disappeared, leaving his new wife dead and drained of blood.

""The Vampyre"" was first published on 1 April 1819 byHenry Colburnin theNew Monthly Magazinewith the false attribution ""A Tale byLord Byron"".[4]The name of the work's protagonist, ""Lord Ruthven"", added to this assumption, for that name was originally used inLady Caroline Lamb's novelGlenarvon(from the same publisher), in which a thinly-disguised Byron figure was named Clarence de Ruthven, Earl of Glenarvon. Despite repeated denials by Byron and Polidori, the authorship often went unclarified. In the following issue, dated May 1, 1819, Polidori wrote a letter to the editor explaining ""that though the groundwork is certainly Lord Byron's, its development is mine"".[5]

The tale was first published in book form by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones in London, Paternoster-Row, in 1819 inoctavoasThe Vampyre; A Talein 84 pages. The notation on the cover noted that it was: ""Entered at Stationers' Hall, March 27, 1819"". Once again, the author was given as Lord Byron on the title page. After Polidori protested, later printings removed Byron's name from the title page but did not replace it with Polidori's.[6]

The story was an immediate popular success, partly because of the Byron attribution and partly because it exploited thegothichorror predilections of the public. Polidori transformed the vampire from a character infolkloreinto the form that is recognized today—an aristocratic fiend who preys among high society.[3]Due to this influential aspect, Jan Čapek argued that ""Ruthven’s excesses in Polidori’s tale reveal the landscape of modern, increasingly capitalistic class society to be laden with anxiety concerning the continuing power of the aristocracy, as though untouched by the social shifts in the wake of the industrial revolution.""[7]

The story has its genesis in the summer of 1816, theYear Without a Summer, when Europe and parts ofNorth Americaunderwent a severeclimateabnormality.Lord Byronand his young physician John Polidori were staying at theVilla DiodatibyLake Genevaand were visited byPercy Bysshe Shelley,Mary Shelley, andClaire Clairmont. Kept indoors by the ""incessant rain"" of that ""wet, ungenial summer"",[8]over three days in June the five turned to telling fantastical tales, and then writing their own. Fueled by ghost stories such as theFantasmagoriana,William Beckford'sVathek, and quantities oflaudanum, Mary Shelley[9]produced what would becomeFrankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus. Polidori was inspired by a fragmentary story of Byron's, ""Fragment of a Novel"" (1816), also known as ""A Fragment"" and ""The Burial: A Fragment"", and in ""two or three idle mornings"" produced ""The Vampyre"".[10]While most scholars pursue Polidori's proximity to Byron as a decisive factor, Jan Čapek warns against a ""Byromaniacal"" reading of the tale, arguing that ""such an infection of the discussion about Polidori with the germ of Byron’s controversial persona is somewhat paradoxical, considering that the resulting debate oscillates somewhere between a sense that Polidori’s conception itself reflects his own sense of the debilitating domination of Byron’s genius and a
sense that Polidori attempted to take control in defence against such domination and wrote the tale in an attempt to satirize the effects of Byron’s proximity and to assert his own worth.""[11]

Polidori's work had an immense impact on contemporary sensibilities and ran through numerous editions and translations. Jan Čapek argued that:

That influence has extended into the current era as the text is seen as ""canonical"" and – together withBram Stoker'sDraculaand others – is ""often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism"".[2]An adaptation appeared in 1820 with Cyprien Bérard's novelLord Ruthwen ou les Vampires, falsely attributed toCharles Nodier, who himself then wrote his own dramatic version,Le Vampire, a play which had enormous success and sparked a ""vampire craze"" across Europe. This includesoperaticadaptations byHeinrich Marschner(seeDer Vampyr) andPeter Josef von Lindpaintner(seeDer Vampyr), both published in the same year.Nikolai Gogol,Alexandre DumasandAleksey Tolstoyall produced vampire tales, and themes in Polidori's tale would continue to influenceBram Stoker'sDraculaand eventually the whole vampire genre. Dumas makes explicit reference to Lord Ruthven inThe Count of Monte Cristo, going so far as to state that his character ""The Comtesse G..."" had been personally acquainted with Lord Ruthven.[13]

In 1819,The Black Vampyre, an American novella by Uriah D'Arcy, was published, taking advantage ofThe Vampyre's popularity.[14]

In 2016, it was announced that the studio Britannia Pictures would be releasing a feature-length adaptation ofThe Vampyre. Production for the film was slated to begin in late 2018, with filming taking place in the UK, Italy and Greece.[15]The film would be directed by Rowan M. Ashe and was scheduled for release in October 2019.[16]

Earlier adaptations of Polidori's story include the 1945 filmThe Vampire's GhoststarringJohn Abbottas the Lord Ruthven character ""Webb Fallon"", with the setting changed from England and Greece to Africa.[17]Also,The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, based on the operaDer VampyrbyHeinrich Marschnerand the Polidori story, was filmed and broadcast onBBC 2on December 2, 1992, with the Lord Ruthven character's name changed to ""Ripley"", who is frozen in the late eighteenth century but revives in modern times and becomes a successful businessman.[18]

In England,James Planché's playThe Vampire, or The Bride of the Isleswas first performed in London in 1820 at theLyceum Theatre[19]based onCharles Nodier'sLe Vampire, which in turn was based on Polidori.[20]Such melodramas were satirised inRuddigore, byGilbert and Sullivan(1887), in which a character called Sir Ruthven must abduct a maiden, or he will die.[21]

In 1988, American playwright Tim Kelly created a drawing room adaptation ofThe Vampyrefor the stage, popular among community theatres and high school drama clubs.[22]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6737,The Social Cancer: A Complete English Version of Noli Me Tangere,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noli_Me_T%C3%A1ngere_(novel),"Crisóstomo Ibarra, themestizoson of the recently deceased Don Rafael Ibarra, is returning to the town of San Diego inLagunaafter seven years of study inEurope. Kapitán Tiago, a family friend, invites him to a reunion party inManila. At the party, Crisóstomo meets Padre Dámaso who was San Diego's parish priest when Crisóstomo left for Europe. Dámaso treats Crisóstomo with hostility, to the surprise of the young man who regarded the priest as his father's friend. Later, as Crisóstomo was walking back to his hotel, Lieutenant Guevara, another friend of his father, informs him that Don Rafael may have been killed for political reasons and Dámaso may have been involved. Guevara warns him to be careful.

The following day, Crisóstomo returns to Tiago's home to meet with his childhood sweetheart, Tiago's daughter María Clara. As the two flirt and reminisce, María reads back to him a part of his farewell letter on his discussion with his father about the state of the country. Ibarra excuses himself eventually as it was time to go to San Diego.

Arriving in San Diego, Crisóstomo goes to the cemetery and finds his father's grave desecrated. He seeks out the gravedigger who then tells him that the parish priest had ordered Don Rafael's remains transferred to the Chinese cemetery, but that he threw the corpse into the lake instead out of fear and pity. At that moment, the town's new parish priest, Padre Bernardo Salví, passes by wherein an enraged Crisóstomo pushes him to the ground, demanding an explanation; a fearful Salví states that he was only newly assigned to the town but reveals that Padre Dámaso ordered the transfer.

Crisóstomo decides to forgive and commits to improvements in his town. He plans to build a private school, believing that hispaisanoswould benefit from a more modern education than what is offered in thegovernment schools, which were under the influence of the friars. Enjoying widespread support from the locals andSpanish authorities, Crisóstomo's project advances quickly. He receives counsel from Don Anastacio, a local philosopher, and recruits a progressive schoolmaster. Construction was set to begin shortly with thecornerstoneto be laid in a few weeks during San Diego's town fiesta.

One day, Crisóstomo, María and their friends go on a picnic along the shores of theLaguna de Baý. They discover that a crocodile had been lurking in the Ibarras' fish pens. The boatman jumps into the water with aknifedrawn. Crisóstomo follows him and the two subdue the animal together. Elías, the boatman, proclaims himself indebted to Crisóstomo.

On the day of the fiesta, Elías warns Crisóstomo of a plot to kill him at the cornerstone ceremony. Sure enough, Crisóstomo evades injury and the would-be assassin is killed. During the luncheon, an uninvited Padre Dámaso further berates Crisóstomo. The other guests hiss for discretion, but Dámaso carries on and insults the memory of Don Rafael. Crisóstomo then loses control, strikes the friar unconscious and holds a knife to his neck. Crisóstomo tells the guests about Dámaso's schemes that resulted in his father's death, but releases Dámaso when María Clara pleads for mercy. Crisóstomo isexcommunicatedfrom the Church, but has it lifted in Manila through the intercession of the sympathetic captain-general. Returning to San Diego, he finds María ill and refusing to see him.

Meanwhile, Elías senses Crisóstomo's influence with the government and takes him for a sail so they can talk in private. Elías reveals that arevolutionary grouphad been trying to recruit him but he stalled in order to get Crisóstomo's views first. The conversation shifts to Elías' family history. It turns out that Elías' grandfather, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office, but one night a fire consumes the office and the Spanish proprietor accuses him of arson. He was prosecuted and jailed; upon release, he was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife turned to prostitution to support the family. Their lives were ruined.

Crisóstomo says that he cannot help and his school project is his focus. Rebuffed, Elías advises Crisóstomo to avoid him in the future, for his own safety. However, Elías returns a few days later to tell him of a rogue uprising planned for that same night. The instigators hadused Crisóstomo's name in vainto recruit malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared tospring a trapon the rebels. Realizing the scheme's repercussions, Crisóstomo abandons his school project and enlists Elías in sorting out and destroying documents that may implicate him. Elías obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don Pedro Eibarramendia. Crisóstomo says Pedro was his great-grandfather and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elías responds that Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather of arson, and thus condemned Elías and his family to misfortune. Elias leaves the house in consternation.

The uprising takes place and many of the rebels are captured or killed. They point to Crisóstomo as instructed and he is arrested. The following morning, the instigators are found dead—Padre Salví, the mastermind of the uprising, ordered his senior sexton to kill them in order to silence them. Meanwhile, Elias sneaks back into the Ibarra mansion and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns down the house. Crisóstomo and his co-accused are loaded into horse carts and taken to prison with their townmates shouting in anger and casting stones as they passed.

Kapitán Tiago later on hosts a dinner at his riverside house in Manila to celebrate María Clara's engagement with Alfonso Linares, a Peninsular who was presented as her new suitor following Crisóstomo's excommunication. Present at the party were Padre Salví, Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other acquaintances. They spoke of the events in San Diego and Crisóstomo's fate. Salví, who lusted after María Clara all along and staged the uprising in order to frame Crisóstomo, says he requested to be moved to the Convent of the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of the San Diego uprising being too much for him.

Guevara outlines how the court came to condemn Crisóstomo. In a signed letter he wrote before leaving for Europe, Crisóstomo spoke of his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Crisóstomo's handwriting was copied to create recruitment letters for the uprising. The signature on the letters was similar to Crisóstomo's seven years before, but not at present day. Crisóstomo only had to deny ownership of the signature on the original letter and the case built on the bogus letters would be dismissed. But upon seeing the letter, which was of course his farewell letter to María Clara, Crisóstomo lost the will to fight the charges, and he is sentenced to bedeported. Guevara then approaches María who had been listening. Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense in yielding the letter. Now, she can live a life of peace. María is devastated.

Later that evening Crisóstomo, having escaped prison with the help of Elías, confronts María in secret. María admits giving up his letter because Salví found Dámaso's old letters in the San Diego parsonage, letters from María's mother who was then pregnant with her and begging Dámaso for an abortion. It turns out that Dámaso was María's biological father. Salvípromisednot to divulge Dámaso's letters in exchange for Crisóstomo's farewell letter. Crisóstomo forgives her, María swears her undying love, and they part with a kiss.

Crisóstomo and Elías slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo and into thePasig River. Elías tells Crisóstomo that his family treasure is buried at the Ibarra forest in San Diego. Wishing to make restitution, Crisóstomo tells Elías to flee with him to a foreign country where they will live as brothers. Elías declines, stating that his fate lies with the country he wishes to reform. Crisóstomo then tells him of his own desire for revolution to lengths that even Elías was unwilling to go. Just then, sentries catch up with their boat at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue them across Laguna de Bay. Elías orders Crisóstomo to lie down and to meet him at his family's mausoleum in the forest. Elías then jumps into the water to distract the pursuers and is shot several times.

The following day, María reads in the newspapers that Crisóstomo had been killed by sentries in pursuit. She remorsefully demands of Dámaso that her wedding with Linares be cancelled and that she be entered into the cloister, or the grave. Seeing her resolution, Dámaso admits he ruined Crisóstomo because he was a meremestizoand Dámaso wanted María to be happy and secure, and that was possible only if she married apeninsular Spaniard. Knowing why Salví had earlier requested to be assigned to the Convent of the Poor Clares, Dámaso pleads with María to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping, Dámaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.

A few nights later in the Ibarra forest, a boy pursues his mother through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant beating of her husband, the death of her younger son in the hands of Padre Salví, and the loss of her elder son to theGuardia Civil. Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the Ibarra mausoleum, but the strain had already been too great for Sisa. She dies in Basilio's embrace. As Basilio grieves for his mother, Elías stumbles into the mausoleum, himself dying from his wounds. He instructs Basilio to cremate their bodies and if no one comes, to dig inside the mausoleum, where he will find treasures, which he is to use for his own education.

As Basilio leaves to fetch the wood, Elías sinks to the ground and whispers that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget those who died in the darkness. Upon returning, Basilio encounters Ibarra also mourning for Elias. The two build a pyre for them before burying their remains. Following the funeral, Ibarra and Basilio dig the mausoleum for the treasures, which the latter receives a share of. Before letting Basilio leave, Ibarra re-echoes Elias' dying advice on the use of the treasures to the boy.

Afterwards, it is revealed that Dámaso is transferred to a remote town; distraught, he is found dead a day later. Tiago fell into depression, became addicted to opium and faded to obscurity. Salví, while waiting for his consecration as abishop, serves as chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares. Meanwhile, during a stormy evening in September, two patrolmen reported seeing aspecteron the roof of the convent weeping in despair. The next day, a government representative visited the convent to try to investigate the previous night's events. One of the nuns had a wet and torn gown and with tears told the representative of ""tales of horror"" and begged for ""protection against the outrages of hypocrisy"" (strongly suggesting that Padre Salví regularly rapes her when he is in the convent). Theabbess, however, said that she was mad. A general also attempted to investigate the nun's case but by then, the abbess prohibited visits to the convent. Nothing more was said about this nun, or for that matter, María Clara.

Rizal finished the novel in March 1887. At first, according to one of Rizal's biographers, Rizal feared the novel might not be printed, and that it would remain unread.[citation needed]He was struggling with financial constraints at the time and thought it would be hard to pursue printing the novel.

His friendMáximo Violaprovided some financial aid, enabling Rizal to have the book printed at Berliner Buchdruckerei-Aktiengesellschaft inBerlin. Viola loaned Rizal₱300 for 2,000 copies. The printing was finished earlier than the estimated five months. Viola arrived inBerlinin December 1886, and by March 21, 1887, Rizal had sent a copy of the novel to his friend,Ferdinand Blumentritt.[6]

Spanish authorities in the Philippines banned the book, but copies were smuggled into the country. The first Philippine edition (and the second published edition) was printed in 1899 in Manila by Chofre y Compania in Escolta.

On August 21, 2007, a 480-page English-language version ofNoli Me Tángerewas released to major Australian book stores.Penguin Classics(animprintbyPenguin Books) published this edition in keeping with its ""commitment to publish the major literary classics of the world.""[7]

American writerHarold Augenbraum, who first readNoliin 1992, had translated the novel. A writer well-acquainted with translating otherSpanish-languageliterary works, Augenbraum proposed to translate the novel. Penguin changed their initial plan of adapting existing English versions and instead commissioned him to make a new translation.[7]

This novel and its sequel,El filibusterismo(nicknamedEl fili), were banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines because of their allegations of corruption and abuse by the colonial government and the Catholic Church. Copies of the book were nevertheless smuggled in and hidden, and when Rizal returned to the Philippines after completing medical studies, he quickly ran afoul of the local government. A few days after his arrival, Rizal was summoned toMalacañan Palaceby Governor-GeneralEmilio Terrero, who told him of the charge thatNoli Me Tángerecontained subversive elements. After a discussion, Terrero was appeased but still unable to offer resistance to pressure from the Church against the book. The persecution can be discerned from Rizal's letter toFerdinand Blumentritt:

Rizal was exiled toDapitaninMindanao, then later arrested for ""inciting rebellion"" based largely on his writings. Rizal was executed byfiring squadat Bagumbayan outside Manila's walls on December 30, 1896, at the age of thirty-five, at thepark that now bears his name.

Rizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a man's life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.

The work was instrumental in creating a unifiedFilipino national identityand consciousness, as many natives previously identified with their respective regions. Itlampooned, caricatured and exposed various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular have become classics in Filipino culture: María Clara, who has become apersonificationof the ideal Filipino woman, loving and unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father Dámaso, who reflects thecovert fathering of illegitimate children by members of the Spanish clergy.[8]

The book indirectly influenced thePhilippine Revolutionof independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain's political affairs. In 1956,CongresspassedRepublic Act 1425, more popularly known as theRizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum.Noli Me Tángereis being taught to third-year secondary school (now Grade 9, due to the new K-12 curriculum) students, while its sequelEl Filibusterismois being taught for fourth-year secondary school (now Grade 10) students. The novels are incorporated to their study and survey ofPhilippine literature.[9]Both of Rizal's novels were initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.[10]

DonJuan Crisóstomo Eibarramendia y Magsalin, commonly referred to in the novel as Ibarra or Crisóstomo, is the novel's protagonist. Themestizo(mixed-race) son of Filipino businessmanDonRafael Ibarra, he studied in Europe for seven years.[11][12]Ibarra is also María Clara's fiancé.

María Clara de los Santos y Alba, commonly referred to as María Clara, María, or Clarita, is Ibarra's fiancée and the most beautiful and widely celebrated girl in San Diego.[13]She was raised by Kapitán Tiago de los Santos, and his cousin, Isabel. In the later parts of the novel, she was revealed to be an illegitimate daughter of Father Dámaso, the formercurateof the town, and Doña Pía Alba, Kapitán Tiago's wife, who haddied giving birthto María Clara.[14]

At the novel's end, a heartbroken yet resolved María Clara entered the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara (aPoor Clarenunnery) after learning the truth of her parentage and mistakenly believing that her lover, Crisóstomo, had been killed. In the epilogue, Rizal stated that it is unknown whether María Clara is still living within the walls of the convent or is already dead.[15]

DonSantiago de los Santos, known by his nickname Tiyago and political title Kapitán Tiyago, is said to be the richest man in the region ofBinondoand possessed real properties inPampangaandLaguna de Baý. He is also said to be a good Catholic, a friend of the Spanish government and thus was considered a Spaniard by the colonial elite. Kapitán Tiyago never attended school, so he became thedomestic helperof aDominicanfriarwho gave him an informal education. He later married Pía Alba fromSanta Cruz.[13]"

The project's chief engineer, D-503, begins ajournalthat he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship. The book is this journal—it titles chapters as '[n]th Entry' and begins each entry with three lines of notes summarising the events therein.

Like all other citizens of the One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by thesecret police, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by that status. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.

While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are illegal according to the laws of the One State.

Repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in the One State, except for windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians but finds that he cannot.

D-503 begins to have dreams, which disturb him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom ofmental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organization plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of the One State with the outside world.

Despite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. During the pregnancy, O-90 realizes that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby. At D-503's request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall.

In his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the ""Great Operation"", which has recently been mandated for all citizens of the One State to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical ""reliability"", they would now function as ""tractors in human form"".[8][9]This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor, the dictator of the One State, about the inner workings of the Mephi. I-330 is then brought to an interrogation chamber, and subjected to torture by suffocation; D-503 expresses surprise that even torture could not induce I-330 to denounce her comrades. Despite her refusal, I-330 and those arrested with her have been sentenced to death, ""under the Benefactor's Machine"".

The Mephi uprising gathers strength; parts of the Green Wall have been destroyed, birds are repopulating the city and people start committing acts of social rebellion. Although D-503 expresses hope that the Benefactor shall restore ""reason"", the novel ends with the One State's survival in doubt. I-330's mantra is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be nofinalrevolution.

The dystopian society depicted inWeis presided over by the Benefactor and is surrounded by a giant Green Wall to separate the citizens from primitive untamed nature.[10]All citizens are known as ""numbers"".[11]Every hour in one's life is directed by the ""Table of Hours"". The action ofWeis set at some time after the Two Hundred Years' War, which has wiped out all but ""0.2 [20%] of the earth's population"".[12]The war was over a rare substance only mentioned in the book through a metaphor; the substance was called ""bread"" as the ""Christians gladiated over it""—as in Christians killed for sport in Roman gladiator games as a form of entertainment, ""bread and circuses"", suggesting a war that was meant to distract the population from a power grab by the government. The war only ended after the use ofweapons of mass destruction, so that the One State is surrounded with a post-apocalyptic landscape.

Many of the names and numbers inWeare allusions to the experiences of Zamyatin or to culture and literature. ""Auditorium 112"" refers to cell number 112, where Zamyatin was twice imprisoned and the name of S-4711 is a reference to theEau de Colognenumber4711.[13][14]Zamyatin, who worked as anaval architect, refers to the specifications of theicebreakerSt. Alexander Nevsky.[15]

Many comparisons to The Bible exist inWe.  There are similarities betweenGenesisChapters 1–4 andWe, where the One State is consideredParadise, D-503 isAdamand I-330 isEve. The snake in this piece is S-4711, who is described as having a bent and twisted form, with a ""double-curved body""; he is a double agent. References to Mephistopheles (in the Mephi) are seen as allusions toSatanand his rebellion againstHeavenin the Bible (Ezekiel 28:11–19; Isaiah 14:12–15).[18][19][20]The novel can be considered a criticism of organised religion given this interpretation.[21]Zamyatin, influenced byFyodor Dostoyevsky'sNotes from UndergroundandThe Brothers Karamazov, made the novel a criticism of the excesses of a militantly atheistic society.[21][22]The novel displayed an indebtedness toH. G. Wells's dystopiaWhen the Sleeper Wakes(1899).[23]

The novel uses mathematical concepts symbolically. The spaceship that D-503 is supervising the construction of is called theIntegral, which he hopes will ""integrate the grandiose cosmic equation"". D-503 also mentions that he is profoundly disturbed by the concept ofthe square root of −1—which is the basis for imaginary numbers, imagination having been deprecated by the One State. Zamyatin's point, probably in light of the increasingly dogmatic Soviet government of the time, would seem to be that it is impossible to remove all the rebels against a system. Zamyatin even says this through I-330, ""There is no final revolution. Revolutions are infinite"".[24]

Along withJack London'sThe Iron Heel,Weis generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristicdystopiagenre. It takes the modern industrial society to an extreme conclusion, depicting a state that believes thatfree willis the cause of unhappiness, and that citizens' lives should be controlled with mathematical precision based on the system of industrial efficiency created byFrederick Winslow Taylor. The Soviet attempt at implementing Taylorism, led byAleksei Gastev, may have immediately influenced Zamyatin's portrayal of the One State.[25]In Russia, a dystopian totalitarian society before Zamyatin was described byMikhail Saltykovin his satirical novelThe History of a Town, and Saltykov's idea of ""Utopia of the straight line"" continues inWe: ""To unbend the wild curve, to straighten it out to a tangent — to a straight line!""[26]

Christopher Collins inEvgenij Zamjatin: An Interpretive Studyfinds the many intriguing literary aspects ofWemore interesting and relevant today than the political aspects:

The little-known Russian dystopian novelLove in the Fog of the Future, published in 1924 by Andrei Marsov, has also been compared toWe.[27]

George Orwellclaimed thatAldous Huxley'sBrave New World(1932) must be partly derived fromWe.[28]However, in a letter to Christopher Collins in 1962, Huxley says that he wroteBrave New Worldas a reaction to H. G. Wells's utopias long before he had heard ofWe.[29]

Kurt Vonnegutsaid that in writingPlayer Piano(1952), he ""cheerfully ripped off the plot ofBrave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin'sWe"".[30]Ayn Rand'sAnthem(1938) has many significant similarities toWe(detailedhere), although it is stylistically and thematically different.[31]Vladimir Nabokov's novelInvitation to a Beheadingmay suggest a dystopian society with some similarities to Zamyatin's; Nabokov readWewhile writingInvitation to a Beheading.[32]

Orwell beganNineteen Eighty-Four(1949) some eight months after he readWein a French translation and wrote a review of it.[33]Orwell is reported as ""saying that he was taking it as the model for his next novel"".[34]Brown writes that for Orwell and certain others,We""appears to have beenthecrucial literary experience"".[35]Shane states that ""Zamyatin's influence on Orwell is beyond dispute"".[36]Robert Russell, in an overview of the criticism ofWe, concludes that ""1984shares so many features withWethat there can be no doubt about its general debt to it""; but that there is a minority of critics who view the similarities betweenWeandNineteen Eighty-Fouras ""entirely superficial"". Further, Russell finds that ""Orwell's novel is both bleaker and more topical than Zamyatin's, lacking entirely that ironic humour that pervades the Russian work"".[29]

InThe Right Stuff(1979),Tom WolfedescribesWeas a ""marvelously morose novel of the future"" featuring an ""omnipotent spaceship"" called theIntegralwhose ""designer is known only as 'D-503, Builder of the Integral'"". Wolfe goes on to use theIntegralas a metaphor for the Sovietlaunch vehicle, the Soviet space programme, or the Soviet Union.[37]

Jerome K. Jeromehas been cited as an influence on Zamyatin's novel.[38]Jerome's short storyThe New Utopia(1891)[39]describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarishegalitarianism, where men and women are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin's ""unifs"") and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has a name: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as inWe. Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome has anyone with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation—something of central importance inWe. There is a shared depiction by both Jerome and Zamyatin that individual and, by extension, familial love is a disruptive and humanizing force.  Jerome's works were translated in Russia three times before 1917.[citation needed]

In 1998, the first English translation ofCursed Days, a diary kept in secret in 1918-20 byanti-communistRussian authorIvan Buninduring theRussian Civil WarinMoscowandOdessawas published inChicago. In a foreword, the diary's English translator, Thomas Gaiton Marullo, describedCursed Daysas a rare example ofdystopiannonfictionand pointed out multiple parallels between the secret diary kept by Bunin and the diary kept by D-503.[40]

Zamyatin's literary position deteriorated throughout the 1920s, and he was eventually allowed to emigrate to Paris in 1931, probably after the intercession ofMaxim Gorky.

The novel was first published in English in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York in a translation byGregory Zilboorg,[41]but its first publication in theSoviet Unionhad to wait until 1988,[42]whenglasnostresulted in it appearing alongsideGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four. A year later,WeandBrave New Worldwere published together in a combined edition.[43]

In 1994, the novel received aPrometheus Awardin the ""Hall of Fame"" category.[44]

The German TV networkZDFadapted the novel for a TV movie in 1982, under the German titleWir(English: We).[45]

Weis heavily referenced in the 2023 sci-fi feature film1984.

The novel has also been adapted, by Alain Bourret, a French director, into a short film calledThe Glass Fortress(2016).[46]The Glass Fortressis an experimental film that employs a technique known asstill image film, and is shot inblack-and-white, which help support the grim atmosphere of the story'sdystopian society.[47]The film is technically similar toLa Jetée(1962), directed byChris Marker, and refers somewhat toTHX 1138(1971), byGeorge Lucas, in the ""religious appearance of the Well Doer"".[48]According to film criticIsabelle Arnaud,The Glass Fortresshas a special atmosphere underlining a story of thwarted love that will be long remembered.[49]

A Russian film adaptation, directed by Hamlet Dulyan and starringEgor Koreshkov, initially planned for release in 2021,[50]was released in 2024.

A two-part adaptation by Sean O'Brien and directed by Jim Poyser was broadcast on 18 and 25 April 2004 onBBC Radio 4'sClassic Serial.[51]The cast includedAnton Lesseras D-503,Joanna Ridingas I-330, Julia Routhwaite as O-90,Brigit Forsythas U, Patrick Bridgeman as S andDon Warringtonas R-13.

The Montreal company Théâtre Deuxième Réalité produced an adaptation of the novel in 1996, adapted and directed byAlexandre Marine, under the titleNous Autres.[52]

Released in 2015,The Glass Fortress[53]is a musical and narrative adaptation of the novel by Rémi Orts Project and Alan B.

In 2022, the Canadianindie rockbandArcade FirereleasedWe, an album whose title was inspired by the novel.[54]

In 2022, independent creator Doug Strain producedBeyond the Green Wall, a Dungeons and Dragons adventure based on the novel.

Many passages are quoted directly from SirThomas Malory'sLe Morte d'Arthur, a late medieval collection of Arthurian legends that constitutes one of the main sources on the myth of King Arthur andCamelot. The frame narrator is a 19th-century man (ostensibly Mark Twain himself) who meets Hank Morgan in modern times and begins reading Hank's book in the museum in which they both meet. Later, characters in the story retell parts of it in Malory's original language. A chapter on medieval hermits also draws from the work ofWilliam Edward Hartpole Lecky.

The story begins as afirst-person narrativeinWarwick Castle, where a man details his recollection of a tale told to him by an ""interested stranger"" who is personified as a knight through his simple language and familiarity with ancient armor.

After a brief tale ofSir LancelotofCamelotand his role in slaying two giants from thethird-person narrative, taken directly fromLe Morte d'Arthur, Hank Morgan enters and is persuaded to reveal more of his story. Hank is a superintendent because of his proficiency in firearms manufacturing, with 2,000 subordinates. During a disagreement with his subordinates, he sustains a head injury when a man named ""Hercules"" hits him with a crowbar.

Hank wakes up underneath an oak tree, having no idea how he got there. Hank soon encounters the knightSir Kay. Kay challenges him to ajoust, which is quickly lost by the unweaponed, unarmored Hank as he scuttles up a tree. Kay captures Hank and leads him towards Camelot Castle. Upon recognizing that he has traveled back to the 6th century, Hank realizes that he is the de facto smartest person on Earth and that with his knowledge, he should soon be running things.

Hank is ridiculed at King Arthur's court for his strange appearance and dress and is sentenced by them, particularly the magicianMerlin, to burn at the stake on June 21. By a stroke of luck, the date coincides with a historicalsolar eclipsein 528, of which Hank had learned in his earlier life. In prison, he sends the boy whom he christens Clarence (whose real name isAmyas le Poulet) to inform the king that he will blot out the sun if he is executed. Hank believes it is June 20; however, it is actually the 21st when he makes his threat, the day that the eclipse will occur at 12:03 p.m. When the king decides to burn him, the eclipse catches Hank by surprise. However, he quickly convinces the people that he caused it. He makes a bargain with the king, is released, and becomes the second most powerful person in the kingdom. (Twain may have drawn inspiration for that part of the story from a historical incident in whichChristopher Columbus exploited foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse.)

Hank is given the position of principal minister to the king and is treated by all with the utmost fear and awe. He proclaims that his only income will be taken as a percentage of any increase in the kingdom'sgross national product, from his efforts as Arthur's chief minister.

Hank learns about medieval practices and superstitions. With his superior knowledge, he is able to outdo alleged sorcerers and miracle-working church officials. At one point, soon after the eclipse, people begin gathering, hoping to see Hank perform another miracle. Merlin, jealous of Hank having replaced him as both the king's principal adviser and the most powerful sorcerer of the realm, begins spreading rumors that Hank is a fake. Hank secretly manufactures gunpowder and a lightning rod, plants explosive charges in Merlin's tower, places the lightning rod at the top, and runs a wire to the explosive charges. He then announces (when storms are frequent) that he will soon call down fire from heaven and destroy Merlin's tower, challenging Merlin to use his sorcery to prevent it. Lightning strikes the rod, triggering the explosive charges and leveling the tower, further diminishing Merlin's reputation.

Hank Morgan uses his authority and knowledge to industrialize the country behind the backs of the rest of the ruling class. His assistant is Clarence, a young boy he meets at court, whom he educates, gradually lets in on most of his secrets, and eventually comes to rely on heavily. Hank sets up secret schools, which teach modern ideas and modern English, thereby removing the new generation from medieval concepts, and secretly constructs hidden factories, which produce modern tools and weapons. He carefully selects the individuals he allows to enter his factories and schools.

As Hank gradually adjusts to his new situation, he begins to attend medieval tournaments. A misunderstanding causesSir Sagramoreto challenge him to a duel to the death. The combat will take place when Sagramore returns from his quest for theHoly Grail. Hank accepts and spends the next few years building up 19th-century infrastructure behind the nobility's back. He then undertakes an adventure with a wandering girl named the Demoiselle Alisande a la Carteloise, nicknamed ""Sandy"" by Hank, to save her royal ""mistresses"" held captive by ogres. On the way, Hank encountersMorgan le Fay. The ""princesses"", ""ogres"", and ""castles"" are all revealed to actually be pigs owned by peasant swineherds, but to Sandy, they still appear as royalty. Hank buys the pigs from the peasants, and the two leave.

On the way back to Camelot, they find a traveling group of pilgrims headed for the Valley of Holiness. Another group of pilgrims, however, comes from that direction and bears the news that the valley's famous fountain has run dry. According to legend, long ago, the fountain had gone dry as soon as the monks of the valley's monastery built a bath with it. The bath was destroyed and the water instantly returned, but this time, it has stopped with no clear cause. Hank is begged to restore the fountain, although Merlin is already trying to do so. When Merlin fails, he claims that the fountain has been corrupted by a demon and that it will never flow again. Hank procures assistants from Camelot, who bring along a pump and fireworks for special effects. They repair the fountain and Hank ""banishes"" the demon. The fountain restored, Hank goes on to debunk another magician who claims to be able to tell what any person in the world is doing, including King Arthur. However, Hank knows via telephone that the king is riding out to see the restored fountain and not ""resting from the chase"" as the ""false prophet"" had claimed. Hank correctly states that the king will arrive in the valley.

Hank has an idea to travel among the poor disguised as a peasant to find out how they truly live. King Arthur joins him but has extreme difficulty in acting like a peasant convincingly. Arthur becomes somewhat disillusioned by seeing for himself the standard of life of his subjects. The two encounter villagers in a minor fiefdom of Arthur's realm, where Arthur is taken as a madman when he makes several outlandish and erroneous comments about agriculture. Hank attempts to teach the villagers about a rudimentary value theory of wages that they rebuff and in his zeal to win the argument, accidentally acknowledges that a member of his audience overpaid a worker, a capital offense. The audience then forms a mob that chases Hank and Arthur down. They seem to be delivered from danger when a nobleman invites them into his entourage, but he enslaves them and sells them to another particularly ruthless enslaver, who takes them to London.

Hank steals a piece of metal in London and uses it to create a makeshiftlockpick. However, before he can free the king, a man enters their quarters in the dark. Mistaking him for the slave driver, Hank starts a fight with him. They are both arrested. Hank lies his way out, but in his absence, the real slave driver has discovered Hank's escape. Since Hank was the most valuable slave, he was due to be sold the next day. The man becomes enraged and begins beating his other slaves, who fight back and kill him. All the slaves, including the king, will be hanged as soon as Hank is found. Hank is captured, but he and Arthur are rescued by a party of knights led byLancelot, riding bicycles. Then, the king becomes extremely bitter against slavery and vows to abolish it when they get free, much to Hank's delight.

Sagramore returns from his quest and fights Hank, who defeats him and seven others, including Galahad and Lancelot, using a lasso. When Merlin steals Hank's lasso, Sagramore returns to challenge him again. This time, Hank kills him with a revolver. He proceeds to challenge the knights of Britain to attack him en masse, which they do. After he kills nine more knights with his revolvers, the rest break and flee. The next day, Hank reveals his 19th-century infrastructure to the country.

Three years later, Hank has married Sandy, and they have a baby. When the child falls critically ill, Hank's doctors advise him to take his family overseas while the baby recovers. In reality, it is a ploy by the Catholic Church to get Hank out of the country. During the weeks that Hank is absent, Arthur discoversGuinevere's infidelity with Lancelot. That causes a war between Lancelot and Arthur, who is eventually killed bySir Mordred.

The Church then places the land underinterdict, causing the people to revolt against Hank. Hank sees that something is wrong and returns to Britain. Clarence informs him of the war. As time goes on, Clarence gathers 52 teenage cadets, who are to fight against all of Britain. Hank's band fortifies itself in Merlin's Cave with a minefield,electric wire, andGatling guns. The Church sends an army of 30,000 knights to attack them, but they are slaughtered by the cadets.

However, Hank's men are now trapped in the cave by a wall of dead bodies and sickened by themiasmabred by thousands of corpses. Hank attempts to offer aid to any wounded but is stabbed by the first wounded man he tries to help, SirMeliagraunce. He is not seriously injured but is bedridden. Disease begins to set in. One night, Clarence finds Merlin weaving a spell over Hank, proclaiming that he will sleep for 1,300 years. Merlin begins laughing deliriously but ends up electrocuting himself on one of the electric wires. Clarence and the others all apparently die from disease in the cave.

More than a millennium later, the narrator finishes the manuscript and finds Hank on his deathbed and dreaming about Sandy. He attempts to make one last ""effect"" but dies before he can finish it.

Twain's first encounter with theMorte d'Arthuroccurred in 1880, when someone in his household boughtSidney Lanier'sbowdlerizededition,The Boy's King Arthur.[3]Whether he read this children's version or not is not known. However, he certainly read the unexpurgated work after his close friendGeorge Washington Cablerecommended it to him in November 1884. The pair were traveling on the lecture circuit as the ""Twins of Genius"" during the winter of 1884–1885 when Cable spotted theMorteon the front table of aRochester,New York, bookstore that both were perusing. Cable pointed to the volume and said, ""You will never lay it down until you have read it cover to cover.""[4]Twain bought this copy and read it in nearly one sitting during a train ride to their next lecture date. After his own book's great success, Twain credited Cable for his inspiration, referring to him as ""the Godfather of my book"".[4]

Soon thereafter, in December 1884, Twain conceived of the idea behindA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Courtand worked on its realization between 1885 and 1889.[5]The bulk of its composition was done at Twain's summer home atElmira, New York, and was completed inHartford, Connecticut.[6]It was first published in England byChatto & Windusunder the titleA Yankee at the Court of King Arthurin December 1889.[7]

Writer and criticWilliam Dean Howellscalled it Twain's best work and ""an object-lesson in democracy"".[8]The work was met with some indignation in Great Britain, where it was perceived as ""a direct attack on [its] hereditary and aristocratic institutions"".[6]

The book pokes fun at contemporary society, but the main thrust is asatireof romanticized ideas ofchivalryand the idealization of theMiddle Agescommon in the novels ofSir Walter Scottand other 19th-century literature. Twain had a particular dislike for Scott, blaming his kind of romanticizing of battle for theSouthern states' deciding to fight theAmerican Civil War. He writes inLife on the Mississippi:

For example, the book portrays the medieval people as being very gullible, as when Merlin makes a ""veil of invisibility"" that, according to him, will make the wearer imperceptible to his enemies, though friends can still see him. The knight SirSagramorwears it to fight Hank, who pretends that he cannot see Sagramor for effect to the audience.

Hank Morgan's opinions are also strongly denunciatory toward theCatholic Churchof the medieval period; the Church is seen by the Yankee as an oppressive institution that stiflesscienceand teaches peasantsmeeknessonly as a means of preventing the overthrow of Church rule and taxation. The book also contains many depictions and condemnations of the dangers ofsuperstitionand the horrors ofslavery.

The book provides evidence of Twain's growing interest inGeorgisteconomics and social theory.[10]This is particularly evident in the interpretative illustrations by Georgist activistDaniel Carter Beard. Twain approved each illustration, and the editors ofThe Mark Twain Encyclopediaconsidered the illustrations an essential part of the work.[11]

George Orwellstrongly disapproved of the book: ""[Twain] squandered his time on boffooneries [such as]A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which is a deliberate flattery of all that is worst and most vulgar in American Life"" (e.g., the various American inventions and institutions Hank Morgan introduces into sixth-century Britain and whose excellence and superiority are taken for granted).[12]

It is possible to see the book as an important transitional work for Twain in that earlier, sunnier passages recall the frontier humor of his tall tales such asThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, while the corrosive view of human behavior in the apocalyptic latter chapters is more akin to darker, later Twain works such asThe Mysterious StrangerandLetters from the Earth.

George Hardy notes, ""The final scenes of 'Connecticut Yankee' depict massed cavalry attempting to storm a position defended by wire and machine guns—and getting massacred, none reaching their objective. Deduct the fantasy anachronism of the assailants being Medieval knights, and you get a chillingly accurate prediction of a typicalFirst World Warbattle.... The modern soldiers of 1914 with their bayonets had no more chance to win such a fight than Twain's knights.""[13]

One frequently overlooked aspect of the book is the emotional intensity felt by Hank toward his family:[original research?]wife Sandy and baby Hello-Central.  Twain's own son, Langdon, died of diphtheria at the age of 19 months, which was likely reflected in Hello-Central's membranous croup. Twain also outlived two of his three daughters, but they both died after the completion of the book. The last chapters of the book are full of Hank's pronouncements of love, culminating in his final delirium, where ""an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you!"" is worse than death.[2]

WhileConnecticut Yankeeis sometimes credited as the foundational work in thetime travelsubgenre ofscience fiction, Twain's novel had several important immediate predecessors. Among them areH. G. Wells's story ""The Chronic Argonauts"" (1888), which was a precursor toThe Time Machine(1895). Also published the year beforeConnecticut YankeewasEdward Bellamy's wildly popularLooking Backward(1888), in which the protagonist is put into a hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up in the year 2000. Yet another American novel that could have served as a more direct inspiration to Twain wasThe Fortunate Island(1882) byCharles Heber Clark. In this novel, a technically proficient American is shipwrecked on an island that broke off from Britain during Arthurian times and never developed any further.[14]

Twain's book introduced what remains one of the main literary devices used in time travel literature—a modern person is suddenly hurled into the past by some force completely beyond the traveler's control, is stuck there irrevocably, and must make the best of it—typically by trying to introduce modern inventions and institutions into the past society. Several works considered classics of science fiction clearly follow on this pattern set by Twain, such asL. Sprague de Camp'sLest Darkness FallandPoul Anderson's ""The Man Who Came Early"". This strand of time travel literature is clearly distinct from that following the basic pattern of Wells's works, where the protagonist is in possession of a time machine and is able to travel at will back and forth in time. The literary device continues to see use throughout modern science fiction, from popular American time travel stories such asMichael Crichton'sTimelineto JapaneseIsekailikeHandyman Saitō in Another World.[15]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/375,An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Occurrence_at_Owl_Creek_Bridge,"Peyton Farquhar, a civilian who is also a wealthy planter andslaveowner, is being prepared for execution byhangingfrom anAlabamarailroad bridge during theAmerican Civil War. Six military men and a company ofinfantrymenare present, guarding the bridge and carrying out the sentence. Farquhar thinks of his wife and children and is then distracted by a noise that, to him, sounds like an unbearably loud clanging. It is actually the ticking of his watch. He considers the possibility of jumping off the bridge and swimming to safety if he can free his tied hands, but the soldiers drop him from the bridge before he can act on the idea.

In a flash-back, Farquhar and his wife are relaxing at home one evening when a soldier dressed inConfederategray rides up to the gate. Farquhar, a supporter of the Confederacy, learns from him thatUniontroops have seized the Owl Creek railroad bridge and repaired it. The soldier suggests that Farquhar might be able to burn the bridge down if he can slip past its guards. He then leaves, but doubles back after nightfall to return north the way he came. The soldier is actually a disguised Union scout who has lured Farquhar into a trap, as any civilian caught interfering with the railroads will be hanged.

The story returns to the present, and Farquhar falls into the creek when the rope around his neck breaks. He frees his hands, pulls the noose away and rises to the surface to begin his escape. His senses now greatly sharpened, he dives and swims downstream to avoid rifle and cannon fire. Once he is out of range, he leaves the creek to begin the journey to his home thirty miles (48 kilometres) away. Farquhar walks all day through a seemingly endless forest and that night he begins to hallucinate, seeing strange constellations and hearing whispered voices in an unknown language. He travels on, urged by the thought of his wife and children despite the pains caused by his ordeal. The next morning, after having apparently fallen asleep while walking, he finds himself at the gate to his plantation. He rushes to embrace his wife, but before he can do so he feels a heavy blow upon the back of his neck. There is a loud noise and a flash of white and ""then all is darkness and silence!"" It is revealed that Farquhar never escaped at all. He imagined his escape and journey home during the time between falling through the bridge and the noose breaking his neck.

""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" was first published in the July 13, 1890, issue ofThe San Francisco Examinerand collected in the compilationTales of Soldiers and Civilians(1891).

Editors of a modern compilation described the story as ""one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature"".[2]AuthorKurt Vonnegutwrote in 2005: ""I consider anybody a twerp who hasn't read the greatest American short story, which is '[An] Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,' by Ambrose Bierce. It isn't remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like 'Sophisticated Lady' byDuke Ellingtonor theFranklin stove.""[4]

The real Owl Creek Bridge is in Tennessee. Bierce likely changed the setting to northern Alabama because the actual bridge did not have a railroad near it at the time of the story.[5]

The story explores the concept of ""dying with dignity"". It shows the reader that the perception of ""dignity"" provides no mitigation for the deaths that occur in warfare. It further demonstrates psychological escape right before death. Farquhar experiences an intense delusion to distract him from his inevitable death. The moment of horror that the reader experiences at the end of the piece reflects the distortion of reality that Farquhar encounters.[6]

It is not only the narrator who experiences the story but also the readers themselves. Bierce said that he detested ""bad readers—readers who, lacking the habit of analysis, lack also the faculty of discrimination, and take whatever is put before them, with the broad, blindcatholicityof a slop-fed conscience of a parlor pig"".[7]

The plot device of a long period of subjective time passing in an instant, such as the imagined experiences of Farquhar while falling, has been explored by several authors.[8]An early literary antecedent appears in theTang dynasty taleThe Governor of Nanke, byLi Gongzuo. Another medieval antecedent isDon Juan Manuel'sTales of Count Lucanor, Chapter XII (c.1335), ""Of that which happened to a Dean of Santiago, with Don Illan, the Magician, who lived at Toledo,"" in which a life happens in an instant.[9][10]Charles Dickens's essay ""A Visit to Newgate"", wherein a man dreams he has escaped his death sentence, has been speculated as a possible source for the story.[11]Bierce's story, in turn, may have influenced ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" byErnest HemingwayandPincher MartinbyWilliam Golding.[5]

Bierce's story highlighted the idea of subjective time passing at the moment of death and popularized the fictional device of false narrative continuation, which has been in wide circulation ever since then. Notable examples of this technique from the early-to-mid 20th century includeH. G. Wells's ""The Door in the Wall"" (1906) and ""The Beautiful Suit"" (1909),Vladimir Nabokov's ""Details of a Sunset"" (1924) and ""The Aurelian"" (1930),Jorge Luis Borges's ""The Secret Miracle"" (1944) and ""The South"" (1949),William Golding'sPincher Martin(1956),Paul Auster'sLulu on the Bridge(1998),Claude Chabrol'sAlice or The Last Escapade(1977),Terry Gilliam'sBrazil(1985) as well asJulio Cortázar's ""The Island at Midday"", andLeo Perutz's ""From Nine to Nine"".Alexander Lernet-Holenia's novellaDer Baron Bagge(1936) shares many similarities with Bierce's story, including the setting in the midst of a war and the bridge as a symbol for the moment of passage from life to death.

Among more recent works,David Lynch's later films have been compared to ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"", although they also have been interpreted asMöbius stripstorylines.[12][13]A particularly strong inspiration for the 1990 filmJacob's Ladder, for bothBruce Joel RubinandAdrian Lyne, wasRobert Enrico's 1962 short filmAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,[14]one of Lyne's favorite movies.[15]Tobias Wolff's short story ""Bullet in the Brain"" (1995) reveals the protagonist's past through relating what he remembers—and does not—in the millisecond after he is fatally shot.John Shirley's 1999 short story ""Occurrence at Owl Street Ridge"" about a depressed housewife is modeled after Bierce's story and Bierce plays a minor role in it.

Critics have noted a similar final act in the 1985 filmBrazil.[16]In the 2005 filmStay(withEwan McGregor,Naomi WattsandRyan Gosling; directed byMarc Forster; written byDavid Benioff) the entire story takes place in a character's mind after a tragic accident. Similar to Bierce's story, in theBoardwalk Empireepisode ""Farewell Daddy Blues"" (2013),Richard Harrowhallucinates a long journey home to his family before his death is revealed.[17]In an interview with Afterbuzz,Teen Wolfwriter and creatorJeff Davissaid that the final sequence of theSeason 3finale (2014) was inspired by ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""

An episode of the British TV seriesBlack Mirrorfollowed a similar plot. In the episode ""Playtest"", Cooper tests a revolutionary video game that causes him to confuse the game with reality. Similar to Bierce's protagonist, it is revealed at the end that the entire sequence of events has taken place in the short span of his death. InScrubs,the episode ""My Occurrence"" has a similar plot structure, where the main character J.D. believes that a clerical mistake was made with his patient Ben. J.D. spends the entire episode trying to get it rectified, only to realize at the end that this was all a fantasy to avoid the reality that Ben had been diagnosed with leukemia. The episode's title is also a reference to the story.

The filmGhosts of Waris about a group of soldiers who find themselves in a time loop. In one scene, one of the main characters briefly tells his fellow soldiers aboutAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, implying that they may be going through a similar situation. It is later revealed that they are in fact part of an experiment and the entire situation is taking place in their minds. The broken hangman's knot and lost traveler cliché figure into the plot for the movieFrom Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughterin which Ambrose Bierce is a character.

The story has also influenced music. For example, the fourteenth track onBressa Creeting Cake'sself-titled 1997 album is entitled ""Peyton Farquhar"". The heavy metal bandDeceasedretold the tale in the song ""The Hanging Soldier"" on its 2000 albumSupernatural Addiction. Adam Young has said that the story was the inspiration for the name of his 2007 electronica musical project,Owl City.[18]TheDoobie Brotherssong ""I Cheat The Hangman"" was inspired by the story according its composer,Patrick Simmons. The song Mendokusai onTellison's2015 albumHope Fading Nightlyfeatures the refrain ""We are all broken necked, swinging from the timbers of Owl Creek Bridge.""

Several adaptations of ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" have been produced."

The story begins with an invocation to theMuse. The events beginin medias restowards the end of the Trojan War, fought between the Trojans and the besiegingAchaeans. The Achaean forces consist of armies from many different Greek kingdoms, led by their respective kings or princes.Agamemnon, king ofMycenae, acts as commander for these united armies.

Chryses, a priest ofApollo, offers Agamemnon and the Achaeans wealth for the return of his daughterChryseis, held captive by Agamemnon. Although most of the Achaeans are in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chrysespraysfor Apollo's help, and Apollo sends a plague to afflict the Achaean army. After nine days of plague,Achilles, the leader of theMyrmidon forcesandaristos achaion(""best of the Greeks""), calls an assembly to deal with the problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father but decides to take Achilles's slave,Briseis, as compensation. Viewing Agamemnon's decision as a huge dishonour in front of the assembled Achaean forces, Achilles furiously declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon.Odysseusreturns Chryseis to her father, causing Apollo to end the plague.

In the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles becomes very upset and prays to his mother,Thetis, a minor goddess and sea nymph.[13]Achilles asks his mother tosupplicateZeus, wanting the Achaeans to be beaten back by the Trojans until their ships are at risk of being burnt. Only then will Agamemnon realise how much the Achaeans need Achilles and restore his honour. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees. Zeus then sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack Troy. Agamemnon heeds the dream but first decides to test the Achaean army's morale by telling them to go home. However nine years into the war, the soldiers' morale has worn thin. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired byAthena, stops arout. Odysseus confronts and beatsThersites, a common soldier who voices discontent about fighting Agamemnon's war.

The Achaeans deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. When news of the Achaean deployment reaches KingPriam, the Trojans respond in asortieupon the plain. The armies approach each other, but before they meet,Parisoffers to end the war by fighting a duel withMenelaus, urged byHector, his brother and hero ofTroy. Here, the initial cause of the entire war is explained:Helen, wife of Menelaus, and the most beautiful woman in the world, was taken by Paris from Menelaus's home inSparta. Menelaus and Paris agree to duel; Helen will marry the victor. However, when Paris is defeated,Aphroditerescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus can kill him.

The gods deliberate over whether the war should end here, butHeraconvinces Zeus to wait for the utter destruction of Troy. Athena prompts the Trojan archerPandarusto shoot Menelaus. Menelaus is wounded, and the truce is broken. Fighting breaks out, and many Achaeans and Trojans are killed.

Source:[3]

In the fighting,Diomedeskills many Trojans, including Pandarus, and defeatsAeneas. Aphrodite rescues him before he can be killed, but Diomedes attacks her and wounds the goddess's wrist. Apollo faces Diomedes and warns him against warring with gods, which Diomedes ignores. Apollo sendsAresto defeat Diomedes. Many heroes and commanders join in, including Hector, and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds Ares and puts him out of action.

Hector rallies the Trojans and prevents a rout. Diomedes and the TrojanGlaucusfind common ground after a duel and exchange unequal gifts, sparked by Glaucus' story ofBellerophon. Hector enters the city, urging his motherHecubato perform prayers and sacrifices, inciting Paris to battle, and bidding his wifeAndromacheand sonAstyanaxfarewell on the city walls. He then rejoins the battle. Hector duels withAjax, but nightfall interrupts the fight, and both sides retire. The Trojans quarrel about returning Helen to the Achaeans. Paris offers to return the treasure he took and give further wealth as compensation, but not Helen, and the offer is refused. Both sides agree to a day's truce to bury the dead. The Achaeans also build a wall and trench to protect their camp and ships.

Source:[3][4]

The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Achaeans back to their wall. Hera and Athena are forbidden to help. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Achaean wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.

Meanwhile, the Achaeans are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, andPhoenixto offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, if he will return to the fighting. Achilles and his companionPatroclusreceive the embassy, yet Achilles angrily refuses the offer, considering the slight to his honour too great. He declares that he will only return to battle if the Trojans reach his ships and threaten them with fire. The embassy returns, unsuccessful.

Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, kill the TrojanDolon, and wreak havoc in the camp of someThracianallies of Troy. In the morning, the fighting is fierce, and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Achaean casualties, and while there, Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech byNestor. Nestor asks Patroclus to beg Achilles to rejoin the fighting, or if he will not, to lead the army himself wearing Achilles's armor.

The Trojans attack the Achaean wall on foot. Hector leads the terrible fighting, despite an omen that their charge will fail. The Achaeans are overwhelmed and routed, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in. The Achaeans fall back to their ships.

Poseidon pities the Achaeans and decides to disobey Zeus and help them. He rallies the Achaeans' spirits, and they begin to push the Trojans back. Poseidon's nephew Amphimachus is killed in the battle; Poseidon imbuesIdomeneuswith godly power. Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seerPolydamasurges Hector to fall back because of a bad omen but is ignored.

Hera seduces Zeus and lulls him to sleep, allowingPoseidonto help the Greeks. The Trojans are driven back onto the plain. Ajax wounds Hector, who is then carried back to Troy. Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. However, he reassures Hera that Troy is still fated to fall once Hector kills Patroclus. Poseidon is recalled from the battlefield, and Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans. The Trojans once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.

Source:[4]

Patroclus cannot stand to watch any longer and goes to Achilles, weeping. He admonishes him for his stubbornness and then asks him to allow him to fight in his place, wearing Achilles's armor so that he will be mistaken for him. Achilles relents and lends Patroclus his armor but sends him off with a stern warning to come back once the Trojans have been pushed back and not to pursue them to the walls. Achilles says that after all has been made right, he and Patroclus will take Troy together.

Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing Zeus's sonSarpedon, a leading ally of the Trojans. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles's command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus kills Hector's charioteerCebriones, is weakened by Apollo andEuphorbos, and is finally killed by Hector.

Hector takes Achilles' armor from the fallen Patroclus. The Achaeans fight to retrieve Patroclus's body from the Trojans, who attempt to carry it back to Troy at Hector's command.Antilochusis sent to tell Achilles the news and asks him to help retrieve the body.

When Achilles hears of Patroclus's death, his grief is so overwhelming that his mother, Thetis, hears him from the bottom of the ocean. Thetis grieves too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die if he kills Hector. Although he knows it will seal his own fate, Achilles vows to kill Hector in order to avenge Patroclus.

Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus's body but has no armor to wear. Bathed in a brilliant radiance by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Achaean wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are terrified by his appearance, and the Achaeans manage to bear Patroclus's body away. Polydamas again urges Hector to withdraw into the city; again, Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp on the plain at nightfall.

Achilles mourns Patroclus, brokenhearted. Meanwhile, at Thetis's request,Hephaestusfashions a new set of armor for Achilles, including amagnificently wrought shield.[14]

Source:[4]

In the morning, Thetis brings Achilles his new set of armor, only to find him weeping over Patroclus's body. Achilles arms for battle and rallies the Achaean warriors. Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, includingBriseis, but Achilles is indifferent to them. The Achaeans take their meal, but Achilles refuses to eat. His horse,Xanthos, prophesies Achilles's death; Achilles is indifferent. Achilles goes into battle, withAutomedondriving his chariot.

Zeuslifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely help both sides. Achilles, burning with rage and grief, slays many Trojans. Achilles slaughters half the Trojans' number in the river, clogging the water with bodies. The river god,Scamander, confronts Achilles and commands him to stop killing Trojans, but Achilles refuses. They fight until Scamander is beaten back by Hephaestus's firestorm. The gods fight amongst themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan. When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans have retreated into the safety of the city, all except for Hector.

Despite the pleas of his parents, Priam andHecuba, Hector resolves to face Achilles. When Achilles approaches, however, Hector's will fails him. He flees and is chased by Achilles around the city. Finally, Athena tricks him into stopping by taking on the form of his brotherDeiphobus, and he turns to face his opponent. After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck. Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he, too, is fated to die. Achilles strips Hector of his own armour, gloating over his death. Achilles then dishonours Hector's body by lashing it to the back of his chariot and dragging it around the city. Hecuba and Priam lament, with the latter attempting to face Achilles himself. Andromache hears the news and comes to the walls, fainting on seeing the scene below. The Trojans grieve.

The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream, urging him to carry out the burial rites so that his spirit can move on to theUnderworld. Patroclus asks Achilles to arrange for their bones to be entombedtogether in a single urn; Achilles agrees, and Patroclus's body is cremated. The Achaeans hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.

Achilles is lost in his grief and spends his days mourning Patroclus and dragging Hector's body behind his chariot. Dismayed by Achilles's continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led byHermes, Priam takes a wagon filled with gifts across the plains and into the Achaean camp unnoticed. He clasps Achilles by the knees and begs for his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears and finally relents, softening his anger. The two lament their losses in the war. Achilles agrees to give Hector's body back and to give the Trojans twelve days to properly mourn and bury him. Achilles apologises to Patroclus, fearing he has dishonored him by returning Hector's body. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11231,"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener","The narrator is an unnamed elderly lawyer who works with legal documents and has an office on Wall Street in New York. In his employ are twoscriveners, Turkey and Nippers, whose ages are 60 and 25, as well as an errand boy nicknamed Ginger Nut, age 12. He then takes on another scrivener, Bartleby.

At first, Bartleby produces a large volume of high-quality work, but one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request: ""I would prefer not to."" To the dismay of the narrator and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby begins to perform fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none. He instead spends long periods of time staring out one of the office's windows at a brick wall. The narrator makes several attempts to reason with Bartleby or to learn something about him, but never has any success. When the narrator stops by the office one Sunday morning, he discovers that Bartleby is living there. He is saddened by the thought of the life the young man must lead.

Tension builds as business associates wonder why Bartleby is always present in the office, yet does not appear to do any work. Sensing the threat to his reputation, but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business to a different building. The new tenant of his old office comes to ask for help in removing Bartleby, and the narrator tells the man that he is not responsible for his former employee. A week or so after this, several other tenants of the narrator's former office building come to him with their landlord because Bartleby is still making a nuisance of himself; though he has been put out of the office, he sits on the building stairs all day and sleeps in its doorway at night. The narrator agrees to visit Bartleby and attempts to reason with him. He suggests several jobs that Bartleby might try and even invites Bartleby to live with him until they figure out a better solution, but Bartleby declines these offers. The narrator leaves the building and flees the neighborhood for several days, so as not to be bothered by the landlord and tenants.

When the narrator returns to work, he learns that the landlord has called the police. The officers have arrested Bartleby and imprisoned him inthe Tombs, or ""the Hall of Justice"", as a vagrant. He goes to visit Bartleby, who spurns him, and bribes a cook to make sure Bartleby gets enough food. The narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby and discovers him dead ofstarvation, having preferred not to eat.

Months later, the narrator hears a rumor that Bartleby had once worked in adead letter officeand reflects on how this might have affected him. The story ends with the narrator saying, ""Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!""

Melville's major source of inspiration for the story was an advertisement for a new book,The Lawyer's Story, printed in theTribuneand theTimeson February 18, 1853. The book, published anonymously later that year, was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland.[2]This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which started: ""In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who interested me considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties."" Melville biographerHershel Parkersaid nothing else in the chapter besides this ""remarkably evocative sentence"" was notable.[3]Critic Andrew Knighton said Melville may have been influenced by an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White'sLaw and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure, which features an idle scrivener,[4]while Christopher Sten suggests that Melville found inspiration inRalph Waldo Emerson's essays, particularly ""The Transcendentalist"", which shows parallels to ""Bartleby"".[5]

Melville may have written the story as an emotional response to the bad reviews garnered byPierre, his preceding novel.[6]Financial difficulties may also have played a part:Moby-DickandPierresold so poorly that Melville was in debt to his publisherHarper and Brothers.[7]

The story was first published anonymously as ""Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street"" in two installments inPutnam's Monthly Magazine, in November and December 1853.[8]It was included in Melville'sThe Piazza Tales, published by Dix and Edwards in the United States in May 1856 and in Britain in June.[9]

The narrator and the text do not explicitly explain the reason for Bartleby's behavior, leaving it open to interpretation.

A 1978 article inELHposits that Bartleby shows classic symptoms ofdepression, such as his lack of motivation. He is a passive person, and good at the work he agrees to do. He refuses to divulge any personal information to the narrator. Bartleby's death is consistent with depression—having no motivation to survive, he refrains from eating until he dies.[10]

Bartleby has been interpreted as a ""psychological double"" for the narrator who criticizes the ""sterility, impersonality, and mechanical adjustments of the world which the lawyer inhabits.""[11]Until the end of the story, Bartleby's background is unknown and may have sprung from the narrator's mind. The narrator screens off Bartleby in a corner, which has been interpreted as symbolizing ""the lawyer's compartmentalization of the unconscious forces which Bartleby represents.""[11]

PsychoanalystChristopher Bollassays the main focus of the story is the narrator, whose ""willingness to tolerate [Bartleby's] work stoppage is what needs to be explained ... As the story proceeds, it becomes increasingly clear that the lawyer identifies with his clerk. To be sure, it is an ambivalent identification, but that only makes it all the more powerful.""[12]

Scholars have long explored the possibility that Bartleby serves as an autobiographical portrait.[13]Lawrence Buellsuggested that the scrivener may reflect Melville as disenchanted writer or artist,[14]Leo Marxconnected the story's theme of alienation with Melville's experiences and feelings of isolation,[15]and Giles Gunn posited that Melville's personal struggles and disillusionment with the literary world influenced his portrayal of Bartleby as a withdrawn and passive character.[16]

""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" alludes toJonathan Edwards's ""Inquiry into the Freedom of the Will"" and Jay Leyda, in his introduction toThe Complete Stories of Herman Melville,comments on the similarities between Bartleby andThe Doctrine of Philosophical NecessitybyJoseph Priestley. Both Edwards and Priestley wrote about free will anddeterminism. Edwards states that free will requires the will to be isolated from the moment of decision, in which case Bartleby's isolation from the world would allow him to be completely free. He has the ability to do whatever he pleases. The reference to Priestley and Edwards in connection with determinism may suggest that Bartleby's exceptional exercise of his personal will, though it leads to his death, spares him from an externally determined fate.[17]

""Bartleby"" is also seen as an inquiry into ethics. CriticJohn Mattesonsees the story (and other Melville works) as explorations of the changing meaning of 19th-century ""prudence"". The story's narrator ""struggles to decide whether his ethics will be governed by worldly prudence or Christianagape.""  He wants to be humane, as shown by his accommodations of the four staff and especially of Bartleby, but this conflicts with the newer, pragmatic and economically based notion of prudence supported by changing legal theory. The 1850 caseBrown v. Kendall, three years before the story's publication, was important in establishing the ""reasonable man"" standard in the United States, and emphasized the positive action required to avoidnegligence. Bartleby's passivity has no place in a legal and economic system that increasingly sides with the ""reasonable"" and economically active individual. His fate, an innocent decline into unemployment, prison, and starvation, dramatizes the effect of the new prudence on the economically inactive members of society.[18]

Though no great success at the time of publication, ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" is now among the most noted of American short stories.[citation needed]

On November 5, 2019, theBBC Newslisted ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" on its list of the100 most influential novels.[19]

In a 2025 ""Read Your Way Through New York City"" feature forThe New York Times,Hernan Diazcalled it a ""quintessential New York book"", describing it as a tale of a ""unclassifiable weirdo who is always on the verge of being crushed by an ever-expanding city ruled by profit and... the compassionate mensch who tries to come to his aid.""[20]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022,A Christmas Carol,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol,"The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled ""staves"".

A Christmas Carolopens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death ofEbenezer Scrooge's business partner,Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageingmiser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaidclerk,Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.

That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.

The first spirit, theGhost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer,Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.

The second spirit, theGhost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market where people are buying the makings ofChristmas dinnerand to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in alighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son,Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.

The third spirit, theGhost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. Hischarwoman,laundressand the localundertakersteal his possessions to sell to afence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.

Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.

The writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature ofhis father John. In 1824 John was committed to theMarshalsea, adebtors' prisoninSouthwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced topawnhis collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infestedshoe-blackingfactory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a ""deep personal and social outrage"", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.[1]

By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works[n 1]as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces.[2]On 31 December that year he began publishing his novelMartin Chuzzlewitas a monthly serial;[n 2]it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.[3]

Celebrating theChristmas seasonhad been growing in popularity through theVictorian era.[4]TheChristmas treewas introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised byQueen VictoriaandPrince Albert.[5]In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest inChristmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication ofDavies Gilbert's 1823 workSome Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of EnglandandWilliam Sandys's1833 collectionChristmas Carols, Ancient and Modernled to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.[6]

Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was ""Christmas Festivities"", published inBell's Weekly Messengerin 1835; the story was then published as ""A Christmas Dinner"" inSketches by Boz(1836).[7]""The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton"", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novelThe Pickwick Papers. In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropicsexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited bygoblinswho show him the past and future.[8]Slater considers that ""the main elements of theCarolare present in the story"", but not yet in a firm form.[9]The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorialMaster Humphrey's Clock.[9]The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the ""Goblins"" story appears to be a prototype ofA Christmas Carol, all Dickens's earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.[10]

Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[11]Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens wasWashington Irving, whose 1819–20 workThe Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.included four essays on old EnglishChristmas traditionsthat he experienced while staying atAston Hallnear Birmingham.[12]The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.[13]

Several works had an influence on the writing ofA Christmas Carol, including two essays by his friendDouglas Jerrold: one from an 1841 issue ofPunch, ""How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas"" and one from 1843, ""The Beauties of the Police"".[14]More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[15]

Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[16]In early 1843 he toured theCornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeingchildren workingin appalling conditions.[17]The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field LaneRagged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.[18]

In February 1843 theSecond Report of the Children's Employment Commissionwas published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of theIndustrial Revolutionupon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled,An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year.[19]In March he wrote to DrSouthwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for theSecond Report, about his change in plans: ""you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea"".[20]

In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at theManchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[21]and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[22]

By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales ofMartin Chuzzlewitwere falling off, and his wife,Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened whenChapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further.[23]He beganA Christmas Carolin October 1843.[24]Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being ""written at white heat""; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December.[25]He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) around London.[26]Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he ""wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition"".[27]Slater says thatA Christmas Carolwas

George Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens onSketches by Boz(1836) andOliver Twist(1838), introduced him to the caricaturistJohn Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work onA Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[28]Dickens's hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph ""... and to Tiny Tim, who didnotdie""; this was added later, during the printing process.[29][n 3]

The central character ofA Christmas Carolis Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman,[30]described in the story as ""a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!""[31]Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[32]The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty ""is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself""; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[33]

Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentricJohn Elwes,MP,[34]orJemmy Wood, the owner of theGloucester Old Bankand also known as ""The Gloucester Miser"".[35]According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of thedemographerandpolitical economistThomas Malthus,[36]while the miser's questions ""Are there no prisons? ... And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?"" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopherThomas Carlyle, ""Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?""[37][n 4]

There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works.Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is ""a more fantastic image"" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[39]Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub fromThe Pickwick Paperswas also an influence when creating Scrooge.[40][n 5]It is possible that Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as ""mean man"".[42][n 6]This theory has been described as ""a probable Dickens hoax"" for which ""[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence"".[44]

When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign ""Goodge and Marney"", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[45]For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to theWestern PenitentiaryinPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners.[37]For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the timeA Christmas Carolwas written.[46][n 7]The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in theEast End of London.[18]

The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[48]Davis considers Scrooge to be ""aproteanfigure always in process of reformation"";[49]Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who ""possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities"".[50]Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running throughA Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as anallegoryof the Christian concept ofredemption.[51][n 8]Dickens's biographer,Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that ""even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man"".[54]Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex;[n 9]he based his beliefs and principles on theNew Testament.[53]His statement that Marley ""had no bowels"" is a reference to the ""bowels of compassion"" mentioned in theFirst Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[57][n 10]

Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a ""secular vision of this sacred holiday"".[11]The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues thatA Christmas Carolshows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friendJohn Forsteras his ""Carolphilosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside"".[58]From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores ""the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects"" of Dickens's ""Carolphilosophy"" ofcharityandaltruism.[59]

Dickens wroteA Christmas Carolin response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularlychild poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[60]The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[61]The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim.[62]Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[63]

As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures ofMartin Chuzzlewit,[64]Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[33]Production ofA Christmas Carolwas not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive greenendpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens's publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades.[65]The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[66]Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in redMorocco leatherand presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[67][n 11]

Priced at five shillings (equal to £31 in 2025 pounds),[68]the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[70]By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[71]Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[72]It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[52]

The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £29,000 in 2025 pounds)[68]rather than the £1,000 (equal to £124,000 in 2025 pounds)[68]he expected.[73]A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[64][n 12]

According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews ofA Christmas Carol""were almost uniformly kind"".[75]The Illustrated London Newsdescribed how the story's ""impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity"" all put the reader ""in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author"".[76]The critic fromThe Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a ""tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King.""[77]William Makepeace Thackeray, writing inFraser's Magazine, described the book as ""a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'""[74]

The poetThomas Hood, inhis own journal, wrote that ""If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.""[78]The reviewer forTait's Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[75]—spoke well ofA Christmas Carol, noting it was ""a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good"".[79]After Dickens's death,Margaret Oliphantdeplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as ""a new gospel"", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better.[75]The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844,Christian Remembrancerthought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[80]The writer and social thinkerJohn Ruskintold a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as ""mistletoe and pudding—neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds"".[81]

There were critics of the book.The New Monthly Magazinepraised the story, but thought the book's physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[82]An unnamed writer forThe Westminster Reviewmocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking ""Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without"".[83]

Dickens had criticised the US inAmerican NotesandMartin Chuzzlewit, making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of theAmerican Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households.[84]In 1863The New York Timespublished an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the ""old Christmas ... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today"".[85]

In January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold fortwopence.[n 13]Dickens wrote to his solicitor

Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis ofcopyright infringementand won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs.[88]The small profits Dickens earned fromA Christmas Carolfurther strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour ofBradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[16]

Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories:The Chimes(1844),The Cricket on the Hearth(1845),The Battle of Life(1846) andThe Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain(1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[89]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/541,The Age of Innocence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence,"The story opens in the 1870s with Newland Archer, gentleman lawyer and heir of one of New York City's most illustrious families, happily anticipates his highly desirable marriage to the sheltered and beautiful May Welland. But he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's exotic and fascinating cousin. Ellen strikes Archer as the opposite of the innocent and ignorant May. She has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a disastrous marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential effect on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturbs Newland, but he becomes intrigued by Ellen, who brazenly flouts New York society's fastidious rules. As Newland's admiration for her grows, so do his doubts about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; the match no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.

Ellen's decision to divorce Count Olenski causes a social crisis for the other members of her family, who are terrified of scandal and disgrace. Living apart can be tolerated, but divorce is unacceptable. To save the Wellands' reputation, a law partner of Newland asks him to dissuade Ellen from going through with the divorce. He succeeds, but in the process comes to care for her. Afraid of falling in love with Ellen, Newland begs May to elope and accelerate their wedding date, but she refuses.

Some weeks later, Newland tells Ellen he loves her; Ellen reciprocates, but is horrified that their love will hurt May, and so does not want him to leave May for her. Newland receives May's telegram agreeing to wed sooner.

Newland and May marry. He tries to forget Ellen. His society marriage is mediocre, and the social life he once found absorbing has become empty and joyless. Though Ellen lives in Washington and has remained distant, he is unable to cease loving her. Their paths cross while he and May are inNewport, Rhode Island. Newland discovers that Count Olenski wishes Ellen to return to him, but she has refused, although her family wants her to reconcile with him and return to Europe. Frustrated by her independence, the family has cut off her money, as the count had already done.

Newland obsessively seeks a way to leave May and be with Ellen. Despairing of ever making Ellen his wife, he urges her to run away with him, but she refuses. Then Ellen is recalled to New York City to care for her sick grandmother, who accepts her decision to remain separated and agrees to reinstate her allowance.

Back in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to meet with him in secret to consummate their relationship. But shortly after their conversation, Newland discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. When May announces that she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen, Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe. That night, after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. The implication is that May did so because she suspected the affair and that this is Ellen's reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly trapped, Newland decides to remain with May and not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for his child's sake.

Twenty-six years later, after May's death, Newland and his eldest son are in Paris. The son, learning that his mother's cousin lives there, has arranged to visit Ellen in her Paris apartment. Newland is stunned at the prospect of seeing Ellen again. On arriving outside the apartment building, Newland sends up his son (who resembles his youthful self) alone to meet Ellen, while he waits outside, watching the balcony of her apartment. Newland considers going up, but in the end decides not to; he walks back to his hotel without seeing her. Newland's final words about the love affair are ""It's more real to me here than if I went up.""[7]

The story's protagonist is a young, popular, and successful lawyer living with his mother and sister in an elegant New York City house. Since childhood, his life has been shaped by the customs and expectations of upper-class New York City society. His engagement to May Welland is one in a string of accomplishments. At the story's start, he is proud and content to dream about a traditional marriage in which he will be the husband-teacher and she the wife-student. His life changes when he meets Countess Ellen Olenska. Through his relationship with her—first friendship, then love—he begins questioning the values on which he was raised. He sees the sexual inequality of New York society and the shallowness of its customs, and struggles to balance social commitment to May with love for Ellen. He cannot find a place for their love in the intricate, judgmental web of New York society. Throughout the story, he transgresses the boundaries of acceptable behavior for love of Ellen: first following her to Skuytercliff, then Boston, and finally deciding to follow her to Europe (though he changes his mind). In the end, Newland finds that the only place for their love is in his memories. Some scholars see Wharton most in Newland, rather than Ellen.[8]

Newland Archer's fiancée, then wife. Raised to be a perfect wife and mother, she follows and perfectly obeys all of society's customs. Mostly, she is the shallow, uninterested and uninteresting young woman that New York society requires. When they are in St. Augustine, though, May gives Newland a rare glimpse of the maturity and compassion he had previously ignored. She offers to release him from their engagement so he can marry the woman he truly loves, thinking he wants to be with Mrs. Rushworth, a married woman with whom he had recently ended a love affair. When he assures May that he loves only her, May appears to trust him, at least at first. Yet after their marriage, she suspects that Newland is Ellen's lover. Nonetheless, May pretends to be happy before society, maintaining the illusion that she and he have the perfect marriage expected of them. Her unhappiness activates her manipulative nature, and Newland does not see it until too late. To drive Ellen away from him, May tells Ellen of her pregnancy before she is certain of it. Yet there still is compassion in May, even in their mediocre marriage's long years after Ellen's leaving. After May's death, Newland Archer learns she had always known of his continued love for Ellen; as May lay dying, she told their son Dallas that the children could always trust their father, Newland, because he surrendered the thing most meaningful to him out of loyalty to their marriage. Outwardly, May is a picture of Innocence.

May's cousin and Mrs. Manson Mingott's granddaughter. She became a countess by marrying Polish Count Olenski, a European nobleman. Her husband was allegedly cruel and abusive, stole Ellen's fortune and had affairs with other women. When the story begins, Ellen has fled her unhappy marriage, lived inVenicewith her husband's secretary, and has returned to her family in New York City. She is a free spirit who helps Newland Archer see beyond narrow New York society. She treats her maid, Nastasia, as an equal, offering the servant her own cape before sending her out on an errand. She attends parties with disreputable people such as Julius Beaufort and Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and she invites Newland, the fiancé of her cousin May, to visit her. Ellen suffers as much as Newland from their impossible love, but she is willing to live in emotional limbo so long as they can love each other at a distance. Ellen's love for Newland drives her important decisions: dropping divorce from Count Olenski, remaining in America, and offering Newland the choice of sexual consummation only once, and then disappearing from his life. Her conscience and responsibility to family complicate her love for Newland. When she learns of May's pregnancy, Ellen immediately decides to leave America, refusing Newland's attempt to follow her to Europe, and so allow cousin May to start her family with her husband Newland. The reception of Ellen's character has changed over time. From a willful temptress to a fabulously independent woman, far ahead of her time, one thing is for certain: “Ellen has only to walk alone across a drawing room to offend its definitions.”[9]

The matriarch of the powerful Mingott family, and grandmother to Ellen and May. She was born Catherine Spicer, to an inconsequential family. Widowed at 28, she has ensured her family's social position through her own shrewdness and force of character. She controls her family: at Newland's request, she has May and Mrs. Welland agree to an earlier wedding date. She controls the money—withholding Ellen's living allowance (when the family is angry with Ellen), and having niece Regina Beaufort ask for money when in financial trouble. Mrs. Mingott is a maverick in the polite world of New York society, at times pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior, such as receiving guests in her house's ground floor, though society associates that practice with women of questionable morals. Her welcoming Ellen is viewed skeptically, and she insists the rest of the family support Ellen. Mrs. Mingott was inspired by Edith Wharton's own portly great-great-aunt, Mary Mason Jones, who is said to have given rise to the phrase ""Keeping up with the Joneses"", due to her belief that fashionable society would always strive to keep up with her.[10]

May's mother, who has raised her daughter to be a proper society lady. May's dullness, lack of imagination, and rigid views of appropriate and inappropriate behavior are a consequence of this influence. Augusta has effectively trained her husband, the weak-willed Mr. Welland, to conform to her desires and wishes. Mrs. Welland is the driving force behind May's commitment to a long engagement. Without her mother's influence, May might have agreed sooner to Newland's request for an earlier wedding date. After a few years of marriage, Newland Archer foresees in May the attributes of his mother-in-law — a woman who is stolid, unimaginative, and dull. Later he comes to experience the same molding by May which was imposed upon Mr. Welland.

One of the most prominent themes that can be seen throughout the text is the idea of wealth and social class. The characters take pride in their social standings and those that come from ""old money"" feel threatened by those that are coming from ""new money"". The characters' lives revolve around staying up to date on the latest fashion, gatherings, appearances, etc. Being accepted by this high society is the most important thing to the people in this novel and they're willing to do anything to be accepted. Being accepted by high-class acquaintances is another common theme that is displayed throughout this novel. Another theme that is clear in the novel is love, whether it be the love between Newland Archer and May Welland, or the undeniable love and lust between Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska. Newland Archer's infatuation with May Welland's innocence can't be missed in the beginning scenes of the novel. The theme of innocence changes throughout the novel, as May states she is pregnant only to ensure that Ellen stays away from Newland.

Helen Killoran explains inThe Critical Reception of Edith Whartonthat critics have always admired Wharton's craftsmanship, her attention to structure, and her subtle ironies, along with her description of interiors (attributed to her time as an interior designer).[11]In the decades since the book's publication, critics have placed more stress on the portrayal of money and class distinctions in the book.[12]

Ellen Olenska and May Welland have also long been at the heart of critical discussion. Originally perceived as having done the right thing by talking about her pregnancy in order to save her marriage, May Welland can also be seen as manipulative rather than sympathetically desperate. Ellen Olenska brings up the generalwoman questionin modern literary criticism.[13]

Rather than focusing on the lavish lifestyle which Newland Archer has not had to work for, some modern readers identify with his grim outlook.[13]

Hillary Kelly suggests that Wharton's ""status made her story more than believable—it made the story real ... Novelists before Wharton understood that storytelling was an act of exposure, but she built it into the architecture ofThe Age of Innocenceand weaponized it.""[14]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271,Black Beauty,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Beauty,"The story is narrated in thefirst personas an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm with his mother, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country. Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness. Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty's life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal ofverisimilitude.[1]

The book describes conditions among London horse-drawncabdrivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixedfares. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day cab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day cab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the cab licence fee was much reduced.

Black Beautyis considered to be one of the first fictional animal autobiographies.[9]Originally meant to be informative literature read by adults on the norms of horse cruelty and preventions of these unjust acts,Black Beautyis now seen as a children's book.[10]Narrated by the main character, Black Beauty, the novel is read by thousands of children worldwide.[11]

Sewell usesanthropomorphisminBlack Beauty. The text advocates the fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England. The story is narrated from Black Beauty's perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the ""bearing rein"" and ""blinkers"" as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses. For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the ""bearing rein"" to Black Beauty, by stating, ""it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don't know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips"".[12]Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty's story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves. The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings. Coslett emphasizes that, whileBlack Beautyis not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that ""allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide"".[13]Dwyer suggests that  ""by the end of the nineteenth century the concern for animal welfare was often mediated by considerations of utility"", implying that these animals (horses) were seen to get the job done by any means rather than the approach that they could be demonizing the animal.[14][clarification needed]

Published in 1877, in the last years of Anna Sewell's life,Black Beautysold over 50 million copies worldwide in 50 different languages.[15]This different viewpoint sparked people's interest to speak for horses' well-being and implement legislation.[16]According to Sewell, providing information was her original goal of horse injustice.[1]Although the shift of perspectives was seen as good for some, it was also an issue to others including horse owners and people who sold such equipment for horses (equipment like blinders).[17]It has been alleged thatBlack Beautywas banned in some countries, e.g. South Africa, for containing the words ""Black"" and ""Beauty"" during its apartheid restrictions on African natives.[18]However, Claire Datnow, in her memoirBehind the Walled Garden of Apartheid: Growing up White in Segregated South Africa,[19]writes that this ""fact"" was a standing joke among her circle of friends, invented to make fun of the ""ignorance of the censors""—the idea being thatBlack Beautyhad been banned ""because the censors thought it referred to a black woman.""

Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimized horses, sympathized and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses. Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies ofBlack Beautywere in circulation in the United States.[20]In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables.[21]The depiction of the ""bearing rein"" inBlack Beautyspurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly. The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses inBlack Beautyinspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals.[22]The impact of the novel is still very much recognized today. Writing in theEncyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, Bernard Unti callsBlack Beauty""the most influential anti-cruelty novel of all time"".[23]Comparisons have also been made betweenBlack Beautyand the most importantsocial protest novelin the United States,Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.[22]

The book has been adapted into film and television several times, including:

Black Beautywas adapted for the stage in 2011 by playwright James Stone. The play was performed at the Broughton Hall Estate, North Yorkshire and Epsom Racecourse, Surrey. The production was a critical success and was performed around the UK in 2012.[28]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1522,Julius Caesar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play),"The play opens with twotribunesFlaviusandMarullus(appointed leaders/officials of Rome) discovering thecommonersof Rome celebratingJulius Caesar'striumphant returnfromdefeatingthe sons of his military rival,Pompey. The tribunes, insulting the crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the insults. During thefeast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade and asoothsayerwarns him to ""Bewarethe ides of March,"" which he ignores. Meanwhile,Cassiusattempts to convinceBrutusto join hisconspiracyto kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he agrees that Caesar may be abusing his power. They then hear fromCascathatMark Antonyhas offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times. Casca tells them that each time Caesar refused it with increasing reluctance, hoping that the crowd watching would insist that he accept the crown. He describes how the crowd applauded Caesar for denying the crown, and how this upset Caesar. On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed topreventhim from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.

After ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wifeCalpurnia's own premonitions, Caesar goes to the Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf ofMetellus Cimber's banished brother. As Caesar predictably rejects the petition, Casca and the others suddenly stab him; Brutus is last. At this, Caesar asks ""Et tu, Brute?""[1](""And you, Brutus?""), concluding with ""Then fall, Caesar!""

The conspirators attempt to demonstrate that they killed Caesar for the good of Rome, to prevent an autocrat. They prove this by not attempting to flee the scene. Brutus delivers an oration defending his actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. However, Antony makes a subtle and eloquent speech over Caesar's corpse, beginning ""Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!""[2]He deftly turnspublic opinionagainst the assassins by manipulating the emotions of thecommon people, in contrast to the rational tone of Brutus's speech, yet there is a method in his rhetorical speech and gestures. Antony reminds the crowd of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with the poor, and his refusal of the crown at the Lupercal, thus questioning Brutus's claim of Caesar's ambition; he shows Caesar's bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar's will, in which every Roman citizen would receive 75drachmas. Antony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to drive the conspirators from Rome. The mob takes Caesar's body to the Forum, lights his funeral pyre, and uses the pyre to light up torches for burning down the homes of the conspirators. Amid the violence, an innocent poet,Cinna, is confused with the conspiratorLucius Cinnaand is taken by the mob, which kills him for such ""offences"" as his bad verses.

Brutus then attacks Cassius for supposedly soiling the noble act ofregicideby having accepted bribes. (""Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake? / What villain touched his body, that did stab, / And not for justice?""[3]) The two are reconciled, especially after Brutus reveals that hisbeloved wifecommitted suicide under the stress of his absence from Rome; they prepare for acivil waragainst Antony, Caesar's adopted sonOctavius, andLepiduswho have formed a triumvirate in Rome. That night, Caesar's ghost appears to Brutus with a warning of defeat. (He informs Brutus, ""Thou shalt see me at Philippi.""[4])

At theBattle of Philippi, Cassius and Brutus, knowing that they will probably both die, smile their last smiles to each other and hold hands. During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend,Titinius. After Titinius, who was not captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He asks his friends to kill him, but the friends refuse. He loses and commits suicide by running on his sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.

The play ends with a tribute to Brutus by Antony, who proclaims that Brutus has remained ""the noblest Roman of them all""[5]because he was the only conspirator who acted, in his mind, for the good of Rome. There is then a small hint at the friction between Antony and Octavius which characterizes another of Shakespeare's Roman plays,Antony and Cleopatra.

The main source of the play isThomas North's translation ofPlutarch'sLives.[7][8]

Shakespeare deviated from these historical facts to curtail time and compress the facts so that the play could be staged more easily. The tragic force is condensed into a few scenes for heightened effect.

Julius Caesarwas originally published in theFirst Folioof 1623, but a performance was mentioned byThomas Platter the Youngerin his diary in September 1599. The play is not mentioned in the list of Shakespeare's plays published byFrancis Meresin 1598. Based on these two points, as well as several contemporary allusions, and the belief that the play is similar toHamletin vocabulary, and toHenry VandAs You Like Itin metre,[12]scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date.[13]

The text ofJulius Caesarin the First Folio is the onlyauthoritativetext for the play. The Folio text is notable for its quality and consistency; scholars judge it to have been set into type from a theatrical prompt-book.[14]

The play contains manyanachronisticelements from theElizabethan era. The characters mention objects such asdoublets(large, heavy jackets) – which did not exist in ancient Rome. Caesar is mentioned to be wearing an Elizabethan doublet instead of a Roman toga. At one point a clock is heard to strike and Brutus notes it with ""Count the clock"".

Maria Wyke has written that the play reflects the general anxiety of Elizabethan England over a succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance,Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that acivil warsimilar to that of Rome might break out after her death.[15]

Critics of Shakespeare's playJulius Caesardiffer greatly in their views of Caesar and Brutus. Many[who?]have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies onrepublicanismandmonarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay ""Ironic Epithet inJulius Caesar"". He points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him analchemist, ""Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offense in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and worthiness"" (I.iii.158–160). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his ""Colossus"" epithet, which he points out has obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser-known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.[16]

Myron Taylor, in his essay ""Shakespeare'sJulius Caesarand the Irony of History"", compares the logic and philosophies of Caesar and Brutus. Caesar is deemed an intuitive philosopher who is always right when he goes with his instinct; for instance, when he says he fears Cassius as a threat to him before he is killed, his intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar, but whose passions lead him to the wrong reasoning, which he realizes in the end when he says in V.v.50–51, ""Caesar, now be still:/ I killed not thee with half so good a will"".[17]

Joseph W. Houppert acknowledges that some critics have tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus is the driving force in the play and is, therefore, the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions, and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.[18]

Traditional readings of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated largely byenvyand ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands ofhonorandpatriotism. Certainly, this is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But one of the central strengths of the play is that it resists categorizing its characters as either simple heroes or villains. Thepolitical journalistand classicistGarry Willsmaintains that ""This play is distinctive because it has no villains"".[19]

The play was probably one of Shakespeare's first to be performed at theGlobe Theatre.[21]Thomas Platter the Younger, aSwisstraveler, saw a tragedy aboutJulius Caesarat aBanksidetheatre on 21 September 1599, and this was most likely Shakespeare's play, as there is no obvious alternative candidate. (While the story of Julius Caesar was dramatized repeatedly in the Elizabethan/Jacobean period, none of the other plays known is as good a match with Platter's description as Shakespeare's play.)[22]

After the theatres re-opened at the start of theRestorationera, the play was revived byThomas Killigrew'sKing's Companyin 1672.Charles Hartinitially played Brutus, as didThomas Bettertonin later productions.Julius Caesarwas one of the very few Shakespeare plays that was not adapted during the Restoration period or the eighteenth century.[23]

One of the earliest cultural references to the play came in Shakespeare's ownHamlet.Prince HamletasksPoloniusabout his career as a thespian at university, and Polonius replies: ""I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me."" This is a likelymeta-reference, asRichard Burbageis generally accepted to have played leading men Brutus and Hamlet, and the olderJohn Hemingesto have played Caesar and Polonius.

In 1851, the German composerRobert Schumannwrote aconcert overtureJulius Caesar, inspired by Shakespeare's play. Other musical settings include those byGiovanni Bononcini,Hans von Bülow,Felix Draeseke,Josef Bohuslav Foerster,John Ireland,John Foulds,Gian Francesco Malipiero,Manfred Gurlitt,Darius Milhaud, andMario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.[32]

The Canadian comedy duoWayne and ShusterparodiedJulius Caesarin their 1958 sketchRinse the Blood off My Toga. Flavius Maximus, Private Roman Eye, is hired by Brutus to investigate the death of Caesar. The police procedural combines Shakespeare,Dragnet, and vaudeville jokes and was first broadcast onThe Ed Sullivan Show.[33]

In 1984, theRiverside Shakespeare Companyof New York City produced a modern dressJulius Caesarset in contemporary Washington, called simplyCAESAR!, starringHarold Scottas Brutus, Herman Petras as Caesar, Marya Lowry as Portia, Robert Walsh as Antony, and Michael Cook as Cassius, directed by W. Stuart McDowell atThe Shakespeare Center.[34]

In 2006,Chris Taylorfrom the Australian comedy teamThe Chaserwrote a comedy musical calledDead Caesarwhich was shown at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney.[35]

The line ""The Evil That Men Do"", from the speech made by Mark Antony following Caesar's death (""The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones."") has had many references in media, including the titles of:

The 2008 movieMe and Orson Welles, based on a book of the same name byRobert Kaplow, is a fictional story centered aroundOrson Welles' famous 1937 production ofJulius Caesarat theMercury Theatre. British actorChristian McKayis cast as Welles, and co-stars withZac EfronandClaire Danes.

The 2012 Italiandrama filmCaesar Must Die(Italian:Cesare deve morire), directed byPaolo and Vittorio Taviani, follows convicts in their rehearsals ahead of a prison performance ofJulius Caesar.

In theRay BradburybookFahrenheit 451, some of the character Beatty's last words are ""There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind, which I respect not!""

The play's line ""the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves"", spoken by Cassius in Act I, scene 2, is often referenced in popular culture. The line gave its name to theJ.M. BarrieplayDear Brutus, and also gave its name to the best-selling young adult novelThe Fault in Our StarsbyJohn Greenand itsfilm adaptation. The same line was quoted inEdward R. Murrow's epilogue of his famous 1954See It Nowdocumentary broadcast concerning SenatorJoseph R. McCarthy. This speech and the line were recreated in the 2005 filmGood Night, and Good Luck. It was also quoted byGeorge Clooney's character in theCoen brothersfilmIntolerable Cruelty.

The line ""And therefore think him as a serpent's egg / Which hatched, would, as his kind grow mischievous; And kill him in the shell"" spoken by Brutus in Act II, Scene 1, is referenced in theDead Kennedyssong ""California über alles"".

The title ofAgatha Christie's novelTaken at the Flood, titledThere Is a Tidein its American edition, refers to an iconic line of Brutus: ""There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."" (Act IV, Scene III).

The line ""There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures"" is recited byJean-Luc Picardat the end of theStar Trek: Picardseries finale, ""The Last Generation."" The play was previously discussed in a conversation betweenJulian BashirandElim Garakin theStar Trek: Deep Space Nineepisode ""Improbable Cause"".

Julius Caesarhas beenadaptedto a number of film productions, including:

Modern adaptions of the play have often made contemporary political references,[47]with Caesar depicted as resembling a variety of political leaders, includingHuey Long,Margaret Thatcher, andTony Blair,[48]as well asFidel CastroandOliver North.[49][50]ScholarA. J. Hartleystated that this is a fairly ""common trope"" ofJulius Caesarperformances: ""Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the rule has been to create a recognizable political world within the production. And often people in the title role itself look like or feel like somebody either in recent or current politics.""[48]A 2012 production ofJulius Caesarby theGuthrie TheaterandThe Acting Company""presented Caesar in the guise of a black actor who was meant to suggestPresident Obama.""[47]This production was not particularly controversial.[47]

In 2017, however, a modern adaptation of the play atNew York's Shakespeare in the Park(performed byThe Public Theater) depicted Caesar with the likeness of then-presidentDonald Trumpand thereby aroused ferocious controversy, drawing criticism by media outlets such asThe Daily CallerandBreitbartand prompting corporate sponsorsBank of AmericaandDelta Air Linesto pull their financial support.[47][51][52][53]The Public Theater stated that the message of the play is not pro-assassination and that the point is that ""those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save."" Shakespeare scholarsStephen Greenblatt[54]and Peter Holland agreed with this statement.[48]Pallotta stated that ""I have never read anyone suggesting that 'Julius Caesar' is a play that recommends assassination. Look what happens: Caesar is assassinated to stop him from becoming a dictator. Result: civil war, massive slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn't look much like a successful result for the conspirators to me.""[48]The play was interrupted several times byright-wingprotesters, who accused the play of ""violence against the right"", and actors and members of theatres with Shakespeare in the name were harassed and receiveddeath threats, including the wife of the play's directorOskar Eustis.[55][56][57][58]The protests were praised byAmerican Family Associationdirector Sandy Rios who compared the play with theexecution of Christians by damnatio ad bestias.[59]

The 2018Bridge Theatreproduction also incorporates modern political imagery. The commoners in the first scene sing modern punk music and Caesar distributes red hats to the audience that are remarkably similar toDonald Trump's campaign merchandise.[60]The conspirators also use modern firearms during the assassination and theBattle of Phillipi.[60]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857,A Journey to the Centre of the Earth,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth,"The story begins in May 1863, at the home of Professor Otto Lidenbrock inHamburg,Germany. While leafing through an original runic manuscript of an Icelandicsaga, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a cyphered note written inrunic scriptalong with the name of a 16th-century Icelandicalchemist, Arne Saknussemm. When translated into English, the note reads:

Lidenbrock departs for Iceland immediately, taking the reluctant Axel with him. After a swift trip viaKielandCopenhagen, they arrive inReykjavík. There they hire as their guide Icelander Hans Bjelke, a Danish-speakingeiderduckhunter, then travel overland to the base ofSnæfellsjökull.

In late June they reach the volcano and set off into the bowels of the earth, encountering many dangers and strange phenomena. After taking a wrong turn, they run short of water and Axel nearly perishes, but Hans saves them all by tapping into asubterranean river, which shoots out a stream of water that Lidenbrock and Axel name the ""Hansbach"" in the guide's honor.

Following the course of the Hansbach, the explorers descend many miles, during which, Axel accidentally gets separated from Lidenbrock and Hans and briefly gets lost in the caverns, but survives a rockslide before being found again.  Eventually, the explorers reach an underground world, with an ocean (which Lidenbrock christens the Lidenbrock Sea, after himself) and a vast ceiling with clouds, as well as a permanentAuroragiving light. The travelers build a raft out of semipetrified wood and set sail. On the shoreline, they see thegazelle-likeLeptotherium, thecattle-likeMerycotherium, aLophiodon(which is described to betapir-like), anAnoplotherium(which is described to be a compound of ahorse, arhinoceros, acamel, and ahippopotamus), amastodon, aMegatherium, and aProtopithecuswhile aPterodactylusflies in the sky.

While at sea, they encounter prehistoric fish such asPterichthyodes(here called ""Pterichthys"")Dipterus(referred to as ""Dipterides"") and giant marine reptiles from the Age of theDinosaurs, namely anIchthyosaurusand aPlesiosaurus, in which a fight between the monsters almost endangers the raft. A lightning storm threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the site of an enormous fossil graveyard (which Lidenbrock, at first, thinks is on the coast they'd departed from, assuming the storm blew them back the way they'd come), including bones from aPterodactylus, aMegatherium, aDeinotherium, aGlyptodon,amammothand the preserved body of a prehistoric hominid.

Lidenbrock and Axel venture into a forest featuring primitive vegetation from theTertiary Period. In its depths they are stunned to find a prehistoric humanoid that is described to be more than twelve feet in height with a head that was huge and unshapely like aEuropean bison, a mane that is similar to a prehistoricelephantthat hid most of its head, and wielding a primitive staff. It was watching over a herd of mastodons like ashepherdand surpassed the height of the known prehistoric hominids that Lidenbrock and Axel know. Fearing the humanoid may be hostile, Lidenbrock and Axel leave the forest before it can see them.

Continuing to explore the coastline, the travellers find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead, but it has been blocked by a recent cave-in. The adventurers lay plans to blow the rock open withgun cotton, meanwhile paddling their raft out to sea to avoid the blast. On executing this scheme, they open a bottomless pit beyond the impeding rock and are swept into it as the sea rushes down the huge open gap. After spending hours descending at breakneck speed, their raft reverses direction and rises inside a volcanic chimney that ultimately spews them into the open air. When they regain consciousness, they learn that they have been ejected fromStromboli, avolcanic islandlocated offSicily.

The trio returns to Germany, where they enjoy great acclaim; Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of the day, Axel discovers that the poles on the compass got reversed during the storm and marries his sweetheart Gräuben, and Hans returns to his peaceful, eiderduck-hunting life inIceland.

The original French editions of 1864 and 1868 were issued by J. Hetzel et Cie, a major Paris publishing house owned byPierre-Jules Hetzel.

The novel's first English edition, translated by an unknown hand and published in 1871 by the London house Griffith & Farran, appeared under the titleA Journey to the Centre of the Earthand is now available atProject Gutenberg.[2]A drastically rewritten version of the story, it adds chapter titles where Verne gives none, meanwhile changing the professor's surname to Hardwigg, Axel's name to Harry, and Gräuben's to Gretchen. In addition, many paragraphs and details are completely recomposed.[citation needed]

An 1877 London edition from Ward, Lock, & Co. appeared under the titleA Journey into the Interior of the Earth. Its translation, credited to Frederick Amadeus Malleson, is more faithful than the Griffith & Farran version, though it, too, concocts chapter titles and modifies details. Its text is likewise available at Project Gutenberg.[3]

There are two modern English translations: one byFrank Wynnewith notes by Peter Cogman, published byPenguin Classicsin 2009, and one by Matthew Jonas, published by Birch Hill Publishing in 2022.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257,The three musketeers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers,"In 1625 France, D'Artagnan leaves his family inGasconyand travels toParisto join theMusketeers of the Guard. At a house inMeung-sur-Loire, an older man derides D'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, D'Artagnan demands a duel. The older man's companions instead beat D'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, a King's elite regiment, is stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the older man, who is actually theComte de Rochefort, an agent ofCardinal Richelieu, who is passing the latter's orders to his spy,Milady de Winter.

In Paris, D'Artagnan visits Tréville at the Musketeers' headquarters. Without the letter, he faces a lukewarm reception from Tréville. Before their conversation concludes, D'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street through Tréville's window and rushes out of the building to confront him. Pursuing Rochefort, he separately offends three musketeers,Athos,PorthosandAramis, who each demand satisfaction; D'Artagnan must fight a duel with each of them that afternoon.

As D'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos'ssecondsare Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the Gascon intends to duel them all. As D'Artagnan and Athos begin, Richelieu's guards appear and attempt to arrest the musketeers for illegal dueling. Offered to leave by the Cardinal's guards, D'Artagnan decides to help the musketeers. Despite being outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle. D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of Richelieu's officers and a renowned fighter. KingLouis XIIIappoints D'Artagnan to Des Essart's company of the King's Guards, a less prestigious regiment, and gives him fortypistoles.

D'Artagnan hires a servant named Planchet and finds lodgings with Bonacieux, a merchant. His landlord later mentions the kidnapping of his wife, Constance Bonacieux, who works forQueen Anne of France. When she is released, D'Artagnan falls inlove at first sightwith her.  Queen Anne secretly meets theDuke of Buckingham, England's first minister. At the meeting, she gives him a diamond necklace, the King's gift to her, as a keepsake.

Richelieu, who wants to diminish the influence of Queen Anne and her Spanish entourage on French internal affairs, plots to persuade the King that his wife is having an affair with Buckingham. On his advice, the King demands that the Queen wears the diamonds to an upcoming soirée. Constance tries to send her husband to London to fetch the diamonds, but he is instead manipulated by Richelieu and thus does not go, so D'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route to England, Richelieu's henchmen attack them and only D'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before arriving, D'Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly to kill Comte de Wardes, a friend of Richelieu, cousin of Rochefort and Milady's love interest. Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan thus returns a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne in time to save her honor.

D'Artagnan hopes to begin an affair with the grateful Constance. Invited to a date, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and Bonacieux, acting under the orders of Richelieu, have kidnapped Constance. D'Artagnan traces his steps back to find his friends whom he abandoned wounded on his way to London. At their meeting, Athos, drunk, tells D'Artagnan a story about a count who fell in love with and married a young woman. Months later, the count discovered that his wife was branded with afleur-de-lison her shoulder, a punishment for felony. The count left her to die in a forest with her hands tied, abandoned his family castle and joined the King's guard under another name. D'Artagnan understands that Athos is telling his own story.

In Paris, D'Artagnan meets Milady and recognizes her as one of Richelieu's agents. He becomes infatuated with her, though her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent towards him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be Comte de Wardes, whom she invited in a letter that D'Artagnan intercepted andmakes love to her. However, D'Artagnan is not content with Milady's having sex with him thinking that he is de Wardes. He fakes a rude letter from de Wardes, offending Milady. She asks D'Artagnan to duel and kill the Comte. As a prepayment, he has sex with her again, without assuming a fake identity. In the heat of passion, D'Artagnan reveals that it is not the first time they are together. Milady is enraged and in the subsequent scuffle, D'Artagnan discovers afleur-de-lisbranded on her shoulder. Milady attempts to kill D'Artagnan, who eludes her. He later tells Athos that his former wife is alive.

Cardinal Richelieu offers D'Artagnan a career in his guards' ranks. Dreading the prospect of losing his friends, D'Artagnan refuses despite understanding that his career prospects diminish as a result. With their regiments, D'Artagnan and the three musketeers are ordered to theSiege of La Rochelle. There, the four friends survive two assassination attempts by Milady's agents. The would-be assassins die in the process.

At an inn, Athos overhears Richelieu asking Milady to murder Buckingham, whose support is critical to the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle. Richelieu gives her his order absolving the bearer from any responsibility, but Athos takes the order from her. To get time to secretly consult with his friends, Athos bets that he, D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis will hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour next morning. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing a dozen Rochelaise in the process, which adds to their legend. They warn the Queen and Lord de Winter about Milady's plan to assassinate Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England, but seduces her guard, Felton,[a]and persuades him to allow her to escape and to kill Buckingham himself.

D'Artagnan is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. He gets a permission to take her from a convent where the Queen sent her to hide.

Upon her return to France, Milady hides, coincidentally, in the convent where Constance is hiding. The naïve Constance clings to Milady who pretends to be another victim of the Cardinal's intrigues. Seeking revenge on D'Artagnan, Milady poisons Constance before he arrives to rescue her. The musketeers catch Milady before she reaches Richelieu. Summoning a local executioner, they put Milady on trial, sentence her to death, and have her executed. The executioner reveals that it was he who branded Milady as a felon years before after she, a young nun at the time, seduced and then abandoned his brother, a local priest.

When the four friends return to the Siege of La Rochelle, Richelieu's Guards arrest D’Artagnan. D'Artagnan gives the Cardinal the secret order absolving the bearer of any responsibility which Athos had taken from Milady. Impressed with D'Artagnan's candor and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, Richelieu destroys the order and writes a new one, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in Tréville's company, leaving the name blank. D'Artagnan offers the letter to his three friends in turn, but each refuses it; Athos because it is beneath him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress, and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood. D'Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, receives the promotion he had coveted.

Les Trois Mousquetaireswas translated into three English versions by 1846. One of these, by William Barrow (1817–1877),[6]is still in print and fairly faithful to the original, available in the Oxford World's Classics 1999 edition. To conform to 19th-century English standards, all of the explicit and many of the implicit references to sexuality were removed, adversely affecting the readability of several scenes, such as the scenes between d'Artagnan and Milady.

In 1960 Manfred E.Graham adapted the book for the Longman's Simplified English Series.

There are 3 modern translations as well. One recent English translation is by Will Hobson in 2002.

Another is byRichard Pevear(2006),[7]who, though applauding Barrow's work, states that most of the modern translations available today are ""textbook examples of bad translation practices"" which ""give their readers an extremely distorted notion of Dumas' writing.""[8]

The most recent translation is by the American translator Lawrence Ellsworth (Lawrence Schick) published by Pegasus Books in February 2018 from the 1956 French edition.

Ellsworth decided to translate the full trilogy ofThe d'Artagnan Romancesas well as the two novels of The Count of Moret for 21st century readers in nine volumes, making it the first complete translation in over a century and a half. Seven out of nine volumes have been published and the eighth volume is in progress in a serialized online publication.[9][needs update]"

In London in 1814, Rebecca Sharp (""Becky""), daughter of an art teacher and a French dancer, is a strong-willed, cunning, moneyless young woman determined to make her way in society. After leaving school, Becky stays with her friend Amelia Sedley (""Emmy""), who is a good-natured, simple-minded young girl, of a wealthy London family. There, Becky meets the dashing and self-obsessed Captain George Osborne (Amelia's betrothed) and Amelia's brother Joseph (""Jos"") Sedley, a clumsy and vainglorious but rich civil servant home from theEast India Company. Hoping to marry Sedley, the richest young man she has met, Becky entices him, but she fails. George Osborne's friend Captain William Dobbin loves Amelia, but only wishes her happiness, which is centred on George.

Becky Sharp says farewell to the Sedley family and enters the service of the crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However, he finds that Becky has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley, a plot orchestrated by Bute Crawley to ensure that Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, who is very rich (having inherited her mother's fortune) disinherits Rawdon; and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth. Initially her favourite is Rawdon Crawley, but his marriage with Becky enrages her. First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she leaves her money to Sir Pitt's eldest son, also called Pitt.

News arrives thatNapoleonhas escaped from Elba, and as a result the stockmarket becomes jittery, causing Amelia's stockbroker father, John Sedley, to become bankrupt. George's rich father forbids George to marry Amelia, who is now poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia, and George is consequently disinherited. George Osborne, William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley are deployed to Brussels, accompanied by Amelia and Becky, and Amelia's brother, Jos.

George is embarrassed by the vulgarity of Mrs. Major O'Dowd, the wife of the head of the regiment. The newly wedded Osborne is already growing tired of Amelia, and he becomes increasingly attracted to Becky, which makes Amelia jealous and unhappy. He is also losing money to Rawdon at cards and billiards. At a ball in Brussels, George gives Becky a note inviting her to run away with him (although this fact is not revealed until the end of the book). But then the army have marching orders to theBattle of Waterloo, and George spends a tender night with Amelia and leaves.

The noise of battle horrifies Amelia, and she is comforted by the brisk but kind Mrs. O'Dowd. Becky is indifferent and makes plans for whatever the outcome (for example, if Napoleon wins, she would aim to become the mistress of one of his Marshals). She also makes a profit selling her carriage and horses at inflated prices to Jos, who is seeking to flee Brussels.

George Osborne is killed at theBattle of Waterloo, while Dobbin and Rawdon survive the battle. Amelia bears him a posthumous son, who carries on the name George. She returns to live ingenteel povertywith her parents, spending her life in memory of her husband and care of her son. Dobbin pays for a small annuity for Amelia and expresses his love for her by small kindnesses toward her and her son. She is too much in love with her husband's memory to return Dobbin's love. Saddened, he goes with his regiment to India for many years.

Becky also gives birth to a son, named Rawdon after his father. Becky is a cold, distant mother, although Rawdon loves his son. Becky continues her ascent first in post-war Paris and then in London where she is patronised by the rich and powerful Marquis of Steyne. She is eventually presented at court to thePrince Regentand charms him further at a game of ""acting charades"" where she plays the roles ofClytemnestraandPhilomela. The elderly Sir Pitt Crawley dies and is succeeded by his son Pitt, who had married Lady Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdown's third daughter. Becky is on good terms with Pitt and Jane originally, but Jane is disgusted by Becky's attitude to her son and jealous of Becky's relationship with Pitt.

At the summit of their social success, Rawdon is arrested for debt, possibly at Becky's connivance.[23]The financial success of the Crawleys had been a topic of gossip; in fact they were living on credit even when it ruined those who trusted them, such as their landlord, an old servant of the Crawley family. The Marquis of Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts but Becky does not use them for expenses or to free her husband. Instead, Rawdon's letter to his brother is received by Lady Jane, who pays the £170 that prompted his imprisonment.

He returns home to find Becky singing to Steyne and strikes him down on the assumption—despite her protestations of innocence—that they are having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the £1000 he had just given Becky was part of an arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pestilential and disease-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in the care of Pitt and Lady Jane.

As Amelia's adored son George grows up, his grandfather Mr Osborne relents towards him (though not towards Amelia) and takes him from his impoverished mother, who knows the rich old man will give him a better start in life than she could manage. After twelve years abroad, both Joseph Sedley and Dobbin return. Dobbin professes his unchanged love to Amelia. Amelia is affectionate, but she cannot forget the memory of her dead husband. Dobbin mediates a reconciliation between Amelia and her father-in-law, who dies soon after. He had amended his will, bequeathing young George half his large fortune and Amelia a generous annuity.

After the death of Mr Osborne, Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to Pumpernickel (WeimarinGermany),[23]where they encounter the destitute Becky. Becky has fallen in life. She lives among card sharps and con artists, drinking heavily and gambling. Becky enchants Jos Sedley all over again, and Amelia is persuaded to let Becky join them. Dobbin forbids this, and reminds Amelia of her jealousy of Becky with her husband. Amelia feels that this dishonours the memory of her dead and revered husband, and this leads to a complete breach between her and Dobbin. Dobbin leaves the group and rejoins his regiment, while Becky remains with the group.

However, Becky has decided that Amelia should marry Dobbin, even though Becky knows Dobbin is her enemy. Becky shows Amelia George's note, kept all this time from the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, and Amelia finally realises that George was not the perfect man she always thought, and that she has rejected a better man, Dobbin. Amelia and Dobbin are reconciled and return to England. Becky and Jos stay in Europe. Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, thereby setting her up with an income. She returns to England, and manages a respectable life, although all her previous friends refuse to acknowledge her.

Amelia, called Emmy, is good-natured but passive and naïve. Pretty rather than beautiful, she has a snub nose and round, rosy cheeks. She is well-liked by men, and women when few men are around, as was the case when she was at school. She begins the work as its heroine (""selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of all"")[27]and marries the dashing George Osborne against his father's wishes, but the narrator is soon forced to admit ""she wasn't a heroine"" after all[28]as she remains soppily devoted to him despite his neglect of her and his flirtation with Becky.

After George dies in theBattle of Waterloo, she brings up little George alone while living with her parents. She is completely dominated by her increasingly peevish mother and her spendthrift father, who, to finance one of his failing investment schemes, sells the annuity Jos had provided. Amelia becomes obsessed with her son and the memory of her husband. She ignores William Dobbin, who courts her for years and treats him shabbily until he leaves. Only when Becky shows her George's letter to her, indicating his unfaithfulness, can Amelia move on. She then marries Dobbin.

In a letter to his close friendJane Octavia Brookfieldwhile the book was being written, Thackeray confided that ""You know you are only a piece of Amelia, my mother is another half, my poor little wifey est pour beaucoup"".[29][c][30]Within the work, her character is compared and connected toIphigenia,[31]although two of the references extend the allusion to all daughters in all drawing rooms as potential Iphigenias waiting to be sacrificed by their families.[32]

Rebecca Sharp, called Becky, is Amelia's opposite: an intelligent, conniving young woman with a gift for satire. She is described as a short, sandy-haired girl who has green eyes and a great deal of wit. Becky is born to a French opera dancer mother and an art teacher and artist father Francis. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky resolves that ""I must be my own Mamma"".[33]

She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's ""anti-heroine"".[34]She does not seem to have the ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere.

Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind.

Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she is less successful with women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres,[35]dismissive of Mrs. O'Dowd, and Lady Jane, although initially friendly, eventually distrusts and dislikes her.

The exceptions to this trend are (at least initially) Miss Crawley, hercompanionMiss Briggs, and her school friend Amelia; the latter is the recipient of more-or-less the only kindnesses Becky expresses in the work, persuading her to marry Dobbin in light of what Becky comes to appreciate to be his good qualities and protecting Amelia from two ruffians vying for her attentions. This comparative loyalty to Amelia stems from Becky having no other friends at school, and Amelia having ""by a thousand kind words and offices, overcome... (Becky's) hostility""; 'The gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia?'

Beginning with her determination to be her ""own Mamma"", Becky begins to assume the role ofClytemnestra.[36]Becky and her necklace from Steyne also allude to the fallenEriphyleinRacine'sretellingofIphigenia at Aulis, where shedoublesand rescues Iphigenia.[37]In lesser contexts, Becky also appears asArachneto Miss Pinkerton'sMinerva[38]and as a variety of classical figures in the works' illustrations.

George Osborne, his father (a merchant, of considerably superior social status to Dobbin's grocer father, albeit self made, and ironically a mere corporal in the City Light Horse regiment of which Dobbin senior, by this time an alderman and a knight, is colonel), and his two sisters are close to the Sedley family until Mr. Sedley (the father of Jos and Amelia, and George Osborne's godfather, from whom the latter takes his middle name of 'Sedley') goes bankrupt following some ill-advised speculation. Since George and Amelia were raised in close company and were childhood sweethearts, George defies his father to marry Amelia. Before father and son can be reconciled, George is killed at the battle of Waterloo, leaving the pregnant Amelia to carry on as well as she can.

Raised to be a selfish, vain, profligate spender, handsome and self-obsessed, George squanders the last of the money he receives from his father and sets nothing aside to help support Amelia. After marrying Amelia, he finds after a couple of weeks that he is bored. He flirts with Becky quite seriously and is reconciled to Amelia only a short time before he is killed in battle.

The best friend of George Osborne, Captain William Dobbin is tall, ungainly, and not particularly handsome. He is a few years older than George but has been friends with him since his schooldays, even though Dobbin's father is a fig-merchant (Dobbin & Rudge, grocers and oilmen, Thames Street, London - he is later an alderman and colonel of the City Light Horse regiment, and knighted) and the Osbornes belong to the genteel class and have become independently wealthy. He defends George and is blind to his faults in many ways, although he tries to force George to do the right thing. He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself. After George is killed, Dobbin puts together an annuity to help support Amelia, ostensibly with the help of George's fellow officers.

Later, Major and Lieutenant Colonel Dobbin discreetly does what he can to help support Amelia and her son George. He allows Amelia to continue with her obsession over George and does not correct her erroneous beliefs about him. He hangs about for years, either pining away over her while serving in India or waiting on her in person, allowing her to take advantage of his good nature. After Amelia finally chooses Becky's friendship over his during their stay in Germany, Dobbin leaves in disgust. He returns when Amelia writes to him and admits her feelings for him, marries her (despite having lost much of his passion for her), and has a daughter whom he loves deeply.

Rawdon, the younger of the two Crawley sons, is an empty-headed cavalry officer who is his wealthy aunt's favourite until he marries Becky Sharp, who is of a far lower class. He permanently alienates his aunt, who leaves her estate to Rawdon's elder brother Sir Pitt instead. Sir Pitt has by this time inherited their father's estate, leaving Rawdon destitute.

The well-meaning Rawdon does have a few talents in life, most of them having to do with gambling and duelling. He is very good at cards and billiards, and although he does not always win he is able to earn cash by betting against less talented gamblers. He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he is content to let Becky manage his career.

Although Rawdon knows Becky is attractive to men, he believes her reputation is spotless even though she is widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.

After Rawdon finds out the truth and leaves Becky for an assignment overseas, he leaves his son to be brought up by his brother Sir Pitt and his wife Lady Jane. While overseas, Rawdon dies of yellow fever.

Rawdon Crawley's elder brother inherits the Crawley estate from his father, the boorish and vulgar Sir Pitt, and also inherits the estate of his wealthy aunt, Miss Crawley, after she disinherits Rawdon. Pitt is very religious and has political aspirations, although not many people appreciate his intelligence or wisdom because there's not much there to appreciate.

Somewhat pedantic and conservative, Pitt does nothing to help Rawdon or Becky even when they fall on hard times. This is chiefly due to the influence of his wife, Lady Jane, who dislikes Becky because of her callous treatment of her son, and also because Becky repaid Lady Jane's earlier kindness by patronising her and flirting with Sir Pitt.

The elderly Miss Crawley is everyone's favourite wealthy aunt. Sir Pitt and Rawdon both dote on her, although Rawdon is her favourite nephew and sole heir until he marries Becky. While Miss Crawley likes Becky and keeps her around to entertain her with sarcasm and wit, and while she loves scandal and particularly stories of unwise marriage, she does not want scandal or unwise marriage in her family. A substantial part of the early section of the book deals with the efforts the Crawleys make to kowtow to Miss Crawley in the hope of receiving a big inheritance.

Thackeray spent time in Paris with his maternal grandmother Harriet Becher, and Miss Crawley's character is said to be based on her.[39]

Amelia's older brother, Joseph ""Jos"" Sedley, is a ""nabob"", who made a respectable fortune as acollectorin India. Obese and self-important but very shy and insecure, he is attracted to Becky Sharp but circumstances prevent him from proposing. He never marries, but when he meets Becky again he is easily manipulated into falling in love with her. Jos is not a courageous or intelligent man, displaying his cowardice at the Battle of Waterloo by trying to flee and purchasing both of Becky's overpriced horses. Becky ensnares him again near the end of the book and, it is hinted, murders him for his life insurance.

Thackeray may have begun working out some of the details ofVanity Fairas early as 1841 but probably began writing it in late 1844.[43]Like many novels of the time,Vanity Fairwas published as aserialbefore being sold in book form. It was printed in 20 monthly parts between January 1847 and July 1848 forPunchby Bradbury & Evans in London. The first three had already been completed before publication, while the others were written after it had begun to sell.[44]

As was standard practice, the last part was a ""double number"" containing parts 19 and 20. Surviving texts, his notes, and letters show that adjustments were made – e.g., the Battle of Waterloo was delayed twice – but that the broad outline of the story and its principal themes were well established from the beginning of publication.[45]

The parts resembled pamphlets and contained the text of several chapters between outer pages ofsteel engravingsand advertising.Wood engravings, which could be set along with normal moveable type, appeared within the text. The same engraved illustration appeared on the canary-yellow cover of each monthly part; this colour became Thackeray's signature, as a light blue-green was Dickens's, allowing passers-by to notice a new Thackeray number in a bookstall from a distance.[46]

Vanity Fairwas the first work that Thackeray published under his own name and was extremely well received at the time. After the conclusion of its serial publication, it was printed as a bound volume by Bradbury & Evans in 1848 and was quickly picked up by other London printers as well. As a collected work, the novels bore the subtitleA Novel without a Hero.[d]By the end of 1859,royaltiesonVanity Fairhad only given Thackeray about£2000, a third of his take fromThe Virginians, but was responsible for his still more lucrative lecture tours in Britain and the United States.[46][e]

From his first draft and following publication, Thackeray occasionally revised his allusions to make them more accessible for his readers. In Chapter 5, an original ""Prince Whadyecallem""[48]became ""Prince Ahmed"" by the 1853 edition.[49]In Chapter 13, a passage about the filicidalBiblicalfigureJephthahwas removed, although references toIphigeniaremained important.[49]In Chapter 56, Thackeray originally confusedSamuel– the boy whose motherHannahhad given him up when called to byGod– withEli,[50]the old priest to whose care he was entrusted; this mistake was not corrected until the 1889 edition,[51]after Thackeray's death.

The serials had been subtitledPen and Pencil Sketches of English Societyand both they and the early bound versions featured Thackeray's own illustrations. These sometimes provided symbolically-freighted images, such as one of the female characters being portrayed as a man-eatingmermaid. In at least one case, a major plot point is provided through an image and its caption. Although the text makes it clear that other characters suspect Becky Sharp to have murdered her second husband, there is nothing definitive in the text itself. However, an image reveals her overhearing Jos pleading with Dobbin while clutching a small white object in her hand. The caption that this isBecky's second appearance in the character ofClytemnestraclarifies that she did indeed murder him for the insurance money,[19]likely throughlaudanumor another poison.[52][40]

""The final three illustrations ofVanity Fairare tableaux that insinuate visually what the narrator is unwilling to articulate: that Becky... has actually been substantially rewarded – by society – for her crimes.""[53]One of the Thackeray's plates for the 11th issue ofVanity Fairwas suppressed from publication by threat of prosecution forlibel, so great was the resemblance of its depiction of Lord Steyne to theMarquis of Hertford.[54]Despite their relevance, most modern editions either do not reproduce all the illustrations or do so with poor detail."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61221,A passage to India,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India,"British schoolmistress Adela Quested and her elderly friend Mrs. Moore visit the fictional Indian city of Chandrapore. Adela is to decide if she wants to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aziz, a young Indian Muslim physician, is called from dining with friends by Major Callendar, Aziz's superior at the hospital, but is delayed. Disconsolate at finding him gone, Aziz walks back and enters his favourite mosque on impulse. Seeing Mrs Moore there, he yells at her not to profane this sacred place, but the two then chat and part as friends. When Mrs. Moore relates her experience later, Ronny becomes indignant at the native's presumption.

Because the newcomers had expressed a desire to meet Indians, Mr. Turton, the city tax collector, invites several to his house, but the party turns out awkwardly, due to the Indians' timidity and the Britons' bigotry. Also there is Cyril Fielding, principal of Chandrapore's government-run college for Indians, who invites Adela and Mrs. Moore to a tea party with him and a Hindu-Brahmin professor named Narayan Godbole. At Adela's request, he extends his invitation to Dr. Aziz.

At the party, Fielding and Aziz become friends and Aziz promises to take Mrs. Moore and Adela to see the distant Marabar Caves. Ronny arrives and, finding Adela ""unaccompanied"" with Dr. Aziz and Professor Godbole, rudely breaks up the party.

Aziz mistakenly believes that the women are offended that he has not followed through on his promise and arranges an outing to the caves at great expense to himself. Fielding and Godbole are supposed to accompany the expedition, but they miss the train. In the first cave they visit, Mrs. Moore is overcome with claustrophobia and disturbed by the echo. When she declines to continue, Adela and Aziz climb the hill to the upper caves, accompanied by a guide.

Asked by Adela whether he has more than one wife, Aziz is disconcerted by her bluntness and ducks into a cave to compose himself. When he comes out, he is told by the guide that Adela has gone into a cave by herself. After quarreling with the guide, Aziz discovers Adela'sfield glassesbroken on the ground and puts them in his pocket. He then looks down the hill and sees Adela speaking to Miss Derek, who has arrived with Fielding in a car. Aziz runs down and greets Fielding, but Miss Derek and Adela drive off, leaving Fielding, Mrs. Moore and Aziz to return to Chandrapore by train.

Aziz is arrested on arrival and charged with sexually assaulting Adela. The run-up to his trial increases racial tensions. Adela alleges that Aziz followed her into the cave and that she fended him off by swinging her field glasses at him. The only evidence is the field glasses in the possession of Aziz. When Fielding proclaims his belief in Aziz's innocence, he is ostracised and condemned as a blood-traitor.

While awaiting the trial, Mrs Moore becomes concerned at her failing health; taking a ship to England, she dies on the way. Then during the trial, Adela admits that she had been similarly disoriented by the cave's echo. She was no longer sure who or what had attacked her and, despite great demand to persist in her accusation, withdraws the charge. When the case is dismissed, Heaslop breaks off his engagement to Adela and she stays at Fielding's house until a return to England is arranged.

Although he is vindicated, Aziz is angry that Fielding befriended Adela after she nearly ruined his life. Believing it to be the gentlemanly thing to do, Fielding convinces Aziz not to seek monetary redress, but the men's friendship suffers and Fielding departs for England. Believing that he is leaving to marry Adela for her money, and bitter at his friend's perceived betrayal, Aziz vows never again to befriend a white person.

Two years later, Aziz has moved to the Hindu-ruled state of Mau and is now the Raja's chief physician by the time Fielding returns, married to Stella, Mrs. Moore's daughter from a second marriage. Though the two meet and Aziz still feels drawn to Fielding, he realises that they cannot be truly friends until India becomes independent from British rule.

The nature of critiques ofA Passage to Indiais largely based upon the era of writing and the nature of the critical work. While many earlier critiques found that Forster's book showed an inappropriate friendship between colonizers and the colonized, new critiques on the work draw attention to the depictions of sexism, racism and imperialism in the novel.

Reviews ofA Passage to Indiawhen it was first published challenged specific details and attitudes included in the book that Forster drew from his own time in India.[11]Early critics also expressed concern at the interracial camaraderie between Aziz and Fielding in the book.[12]Others saw the book as a vilification ofhumanistperspectives on the importance of interpersonal relationships, and effects of colonialism on Indian society.[13]More recent critiques by postcolonial theorists and literary critics have reinvestigated the text as a work ofOrientalistfiction contributing to a discourse on colonial relationships by a European. Today it is one of the seminal texts in the postcolonial Orientalist discourse, among other books likeHeart of Darkness, byJoseph Conrad, andKim, byRudyard Kipling.[11]

A Passage to Indiaemerged at a time when portrayals of India as a savage, disorganized land in need of domination were more popular in mainstream European literature than romanticized depictions. Forster's novel departed from typical narratives about colonizer-colonized relationships and emphasized a more ""unknowable"" Orient, rather than characterizing it with exoticism, ancient wisdom and mystery. Postcolonial theorists like Maryam Wasif Khan have termed this novel a Modern Orientalist text, meaning that it portrays the Orient in an optimistic, positive light while simultaneously challenging and critiquing European culture and society.[14]However, Benita Parry suggests that it also mystifies India by creating an ""obfuscated realm where the secular is scanted, and in which India's long traditions of mathematics, science and technology, history, linguistics and jurisprudence have no place.""[13]

One of the most notable critiques comes from literary professorEdward Said, who referencedA Passage to Indiain bothCulture and ImperialismandOrientalism. In his discussion about allusions to theBritish Empirein early 20th-century novels, Said suggests that though the work subverted typical views on colonialism and colonial rule in India, it also fell short of outright condemning either nationalist movements in India or colonialism itself. Of Forster's attitude toward colonizer-colonized relationships, Said says Forster:

Stereotyping and Orientalist thought is also explored in postcolonial critiques. Said suggests that Forster deals with the question of British-Indian relationships by separating Muslims and Hindus in the narrative. He says Forster connects Islam to Western values and attitudes while suggesting that Hinduism is chaotic and orderless, and subsequently uses Hindu characters as the background to the main narrative.[15]Said also identifies the failed attempt at friendship between Aziz and Fielding as a reinforcement of the perceived cultural distance between the Orient and the West. The inability of the two men to begin a meaningful friendship is indicative of what Said suggests is the irreconcilable otherness of the Orient, something that has originated from the West and also limits Western readers in how they understand the Orient.[16]

Other scholars have examined the book with a critical postcolonial andfeministlens. Maryam Wasif Khan's reading of the book suggestsA Passage to Indiais also a commentary on gender, and a British woman's place within the empire. Khan argued that the female characters coming to ""the Orient"" to break free of their social roles in Britain represent the discord between Englishwomen and their social roles at home, and tells the narrative of ""pioneering Englishwomen whose emergent feminism found form and voice in the colony"".[17]

Sara Sulerihas also critiqued the book's orientalist depiction of India and its use of racialized bodies, especially in the case of Aziz, as sexual objects rather than individuals.[18]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22367,Die Verwandlung (German),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis,"Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a ""monstrousvermin"". He initially considers the transformation to be temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of hismetamorphosis. Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which he characterizes as being full of ""always changing, never enduring human exchanges that don't ever become intimate"".[4]He sees his employer as adespotand would quickly quit his job if he were not his family's sole breadwinner and working off hisbankruptfather's debts. While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor's unexcused absence. Gregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees the apartment. Gregor's family is horrified, and his father drives him back towards his room. Gregor is injured when he tries to force himself through the doorway (which is too narrow for him) but gets unstuck when his father shoves him through.

With Gregor's unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which she finds Gregor only likes if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around on the floor, walls, and ceiling. Upon discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space. She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything, except the sofa under which Gregor hides whenever anyone comes in. He finds their actions deeply distressing, fearing that he might forget his past as a human, and desperately tries to save a particularly loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it. When Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in his back and severely wounds him.

Gregor suffers from his injuries and eats very little. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and increasingly begin to neglect him, and his room begins to be used for storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor's door open in the evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male tenants, since they are not told about Gregor. One day, thecharwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and before she leaves, neglects to close his door fully. Attracted by Grete's violin-playing in the living room, Gregor crawls out and is spotted by the unsuspecting tenants, who complain about the apartment's unhygienic conditions and say they are leaving, will not pay anything for the time they have already stayed, and may take legal action. Grete, who is tired of taking care of Gregor and realizes the burden his existence puts on each member of the family, tells her parents they must get rid of ""it"" or they will all be ruined. Gregor, understanding that he is no longer wanted, laboriously makes his way back to his room and dies of starvation before sunrise. His body is discovered by the charwoman, who alerts his family and then disposes of the corpse. The relieved and optimistic father, mother, and sister all take the day off work. They travel by tram into the countryside and make plans to move to a smaller apartment to save money. During the short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, despite the hardships that have brought some paleness to her face, Grete has grown up into a pretty young lady with a good figure and they think about finding her a husband."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/159,The island of Doctor Moreau,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau,"Edward Prendick is an Englishman with a scientific education who survives a shipwreck of his boat, the Lady Vain, in the southern Pacific Ocean. A passing ship calledIpecacuanhatakes him aboard and a man named Montgomery revives him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M'ling who appears to be Montgomery'smanservant. The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery, most strangely apuma. As they approach the island which is Montgomery's destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in adinghyand sails away. Seeing that the captain has abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an enclosed compound.

The island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome experiments invivisectionhad been publicly exposed, and who fled Great Britain as a result of his exposure.

The next day, Moreau begins working on the puma, eventually revealed as being experimented into a woman. Prendick gathers that Moreau is performing a painful experiment on the animal and its anguished cries drive Prendick out into the jungle. While he wanders, he comes upon a group of people who seem human but have an unmistakable resemblance toswine. As he walks back to the enclosure, he suddenly realises he is being followed by a figure in the jungle. He panics and flees, and the figure gives chase. As his pursuer bears down on him, Prendick manages to stun him with a stone and observes that the pursuer is a monstrous hybrid of animal and man. When Prendick returns to the enclosure and questions Montgomery, Montgomery refuses to be open with him. After failing to get an explanation, Prendick finally gives in and takes asleeping draught.

Prendick awakes the next morning with the previous night's activities fresh in his mind. Seeing that the door to Moreau's operating room has been left unlocked, he walks in to find a humanoid form lying in bandages on the table before he is ejected by a shocked and angry Moreau. He believes that Moreau has been vivisecting humans and that he is the next test subject. He flees into the jungle where he meets anApe-Man who takes him to a colony of similarly half-human/half-animal creatures including aSloth-Man. Their leader is a large grey unspecified creature named the Sayer of the Law who has him recite a strange litany called the Law that involves prohibitions against bestial behaviour and praise for Moreau:

Suddenly, Dr. Moreau bursts into the colony looking for Prendick, but Prendick escapes to the jungle. He makes for the ocean where he plans to drown himself rather than allow Moreau to experiment on him. Moreau explains that the creatures called theBeast Folkwere not formerly men, but rather animals. Prendick returns to the enclosure where Moreau explains that he has been on the island for eleven years and has been striving to make a complete transformation of an animal to a human. He explains that while he is getting closer to perfection, his subjects have a habit of reverting to their animal form and behaviour. Moreau regards the pain he inflicts as insignificant and an unavoidable side effect in the name of his scientific experiments. He also states that pain is an animalistic instinct that one who is truly human cannot have, cutting his thigh with apenknifewith no apparent reaction, to further prove his point.

One day, Prendick and Montgomery encounter a half-eaten rabbit. Since eating flesh and tasting blood are strong prohibitions, Dr. Moreau calls an assembly of the Beast Folk and identifies theLeopard-Man (the same one that chased Prendick the first time he wandered into the jungle) as the transgressor. Knowing that he will be sent back to Dr. Moreau's compound for more painful sessions of vivisection, the Leopard-Man flees. Eventually, the group corners him in some undergrowth, but Prendick takes pity and shoots him to spare him from further suffering. Prendick also believes that although the Leopard-Man was seen breaking several laws, such as drinking water bent down like an animal, chasing men (Prendick), and running on all fours, the Leopard-Man was not solely responsible for the deaths of the rabbits. It was also theHyena-Swine, the next most dangerous Beast Man on the island. Dr. Moreau is furious that Prendick killed the Leopard-Man but can do nothing about the situation.

As time passes, Prendick becomes inured to the grotesqueness of the Beast Folk. However one day, the half-finished puma woman rips free of her restraints and escapes from the lab. Dr. Moreau pursues her, but the two end up fighting each other, leading to their mutual deaths. Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island, but later hears a commotion outside in which Montgomery, his servant M'ling, and the Sayer of the Law die after a fight with the Beast Folk. At the same time, the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp. With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure, Prendick realizes that Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island during the night.

Prendick lives with the Beast Folk on the island for months after the deaths of Moreau and Montgomery. As the time goes by, the Beast Folk increasingly revert to their original animal instincts, beginning to hunt the island's rabbits, returning to walking on all fours, and leaving their shared living areas for the wild. They cease to follow Prendick's instructions. Eventually, the Hyena-Swine kills Prendick's faithful Dog-Man companion created from a St. Bernard. With help from the Sloth Creature, Prendick shoots the Hyena-Swine in self-defence.

Prendick's efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful. Luckily for him, a lifeboat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (Perhaps the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor).[8]Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days later. When he tells his story, he is thought to be mad. So he feigns amnesia.

Upon his return to England, Prendick is no longer comfortable in the presence of humans, all of whom seem to him to be about to revert to an animal state. He leaves London and lives in near-solitude in the countryside, devoting himself to chemistry and astronomy in the studies of which he finds some peace.

TheBeast Folkare animals which Moreau has experimented upon, giving them human traits via vivisection for which the surgery is extremely painful. They include:

The publication of the novel caused an outrage among critics and the media.The London Timescalled it ""loathsome and repulsive"". Famous zoologistPeter Chalmers Mitchellwas hired by theSaturday Reviewto write a review, where he called Wells a scientific heretic. And the humor magazinePunchpublished a parody called ""The Island of Doctor Menu"", by James F. Sullivan. All the attention and publicity also made it Wells' best selling novel to date.[9]

At the time of the novel's publication in 1896, there was growing discussion in Europe of the possibility of thedegenerationof the human race. Increasing opposition to animalvivisectionled to formation of groups like theNational Anti-Vivisection Societyin 1875, and theBritish Union for the Abolition of Vivisectionin 1898.[10]The Island of Dr. Moreaureflects the ethical, philosophical, and scientific concerns and controversies raised by these themes and the ideas ofDarwinian evolutionwhich were so disrupting to social norms in the late 1800s.

In his preface to The Works of H.G. Wells, Volume 2, The Atlantic Edition (1924), Wells explains thatThe Island of Dr. Moreauwas inspired by thetrial of Oscar Wilde."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175,The Phantom of the Opera,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(novel),"In the 1880s, inParis, thePalais GarnierOpera House is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the 'Phantom of the Opera', or simply the 'Opera Ghost', after stagehand Joseph Buquet is found hanged, the noose around his neck missing.

At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house's managers, a young, little-known Swedish soprano,Christine Daaé, is called upon to sing in place of the opera's leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill. Christine's performance is a success. Among the audience is the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who recognizes her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine leaves, only to find it empty.

AtPerros-Guirec, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine says she has been tutored by the ""Angel of Music"", whom her father used to tell her and Raoul about. When Raoul suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms off. Christine visits her father's grave one night, where a mysterious figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront the figure but is struck and knocked out in the process.

Back at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite inFaustand that box 5 be left empty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers assume his demands are a prank and ignore them. Soon after, Carlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and a chandelier drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man calledErik.

Erik intends to hold her prisoner in his lair with him for a few days. Still, she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his skull-like face. Fearing that she will leave him, he decides to hold her permanently. However, when Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him.

On the roof of the Opera House, Christine tells Raoul about her abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul says he will act on his promise the next day. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik is watching them and overheard their whole conversation.

The following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a production ofFaustand tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a mysterious Opera House regular, 'the Persian', into Erik's secret lair in the bowels of the building. Still, they end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives.

Under duress, Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives. Still, Christine begs, promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride. Erik releases Raoul and 'the Persian' from his torture chamber.

When Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead and is eventually given a kiss back. Erik reveals he has never kissed anyone, including his own mother, who would run away if he ever tried to kiss her. Moved, he and Christine cry together. She also holds his hand and says, ""Poor, unhappy Erik"", which reduces him to ""a dog ready to die for her"".

He allows 'the Persian' and Raoul to escape, though not before making Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day and return the ring he gave her. He also makes 'the Persian' promise that afterward, he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon ""of love.""

Later, Christine returns to Erik's lair, and per his request returns the ring and buries him 'somewhere he will never be found'. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the note: ""Erik is dead"".

Christine and Raoul then elope together, never to return.

The epilogue reveals that Erik was born deformed, and the son of a construction business owner. He ran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and caravans, schooling himself in the circus arts across Europe and Asia, and eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey.

Returning to France, he started his own construction business. After being subcontracted to work on the Palais Garnier's foundations, Erik discreetly built his secret lair, complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.

Leroux uses the operatic setting inThe Phantom of the Operato use music as a device for foreshadowing.[8]Ribière makes note that Leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician, so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device. She uses the example of how Leroux introducesDanse macabrewhich means ""dance of death"" in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the Phantom plays the fiddle for Christine and attacks Raoul when he tries to intervene.

Drumright points out that music is evident throughout the novel in that it is the basis for Christine and Erik's relationship. Christine sees Erik as her Angel of Music that her father promised would come to her one day. The Phantom sees Christine as his musical protégé, and he uses his passion for music to teach her everything he knows.[9]

The novel is styled as amystery novel, as its frame is narrated by a detective acquiring his information through various investigations.[10]The mystery under investigation is the identity and motive of 'the Phantom' who lurks through the opera house, seemingly appearing out of nowhere as if by magic in inaccessible places. But, it seems that the mystery novel frame story is a façade for the genre being more aGothic romance.[11]

In his article, Fitzpatrick compares the Phantom to other monsters featured inGothic novelssuch asFrankenstein's monster,Dr. Jekyll,Dorian Gray, andCount Dracula. The Phantom has a torture chamber where he kidnaps and kills people, and the walls of the chapel in the graveyard are lined with human bones.[11]Drumright notes thatThe Phantom of the Operachecks off every trope necessary to have a Gothic novel according to theEncyclopedia of Literature'sdescription which says, ""Such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts, madness, outrage,
superstition, and revenge.""[12]Although the Phantom is really just a deformed man, he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster. People are frightened by him because of his deformities and the acts of violence he commits.[9]

The novel features alove trianglebetween the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. Raoul is seen as Christine's childhood love whom she is familiar with and has affection for. He is rich and therefore offers her security as well as a wholesome, Christian marriage. The Phantom, on the other hand, is not familiar. He is dark, ugly and dangerous, and therefore represents the forbidden love. However, Christine is drawn to him because she sees him as her Angel of Music, and she pities his existence of loneliness and darkness.[9]

By the time Leroux publishedThe Phantom of the Opera, he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both French- and English-speaking countries. He had written six novels prior, two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication:The Mystery of the Yellow RoomandThe Perfume of the Lady in Black.[8]Although previous commentators have asserted thatThe Phantom of the Operadid not attain as much success as these previous novels, being particularly unpopular in France where it was first published,[13]recent research into the novel's early reception and sales has indicated the contrary.[14]One book review from theNew York Timesexpressed disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed, saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man.[15]The majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in French, American, and English newspapers. This serialized version of the story became important when it was read and sought out by Universal Pictures to be adapted into a movie in 1925.[13]Leroux did not live to see all the success from his novel and its subsequent critical re-evaluation; he died in April 1927.[16]

The book currently holds a rating of 3.96 out of 5 onGoodreadswith 35% of a total 263,089 ratings being 5 stars.[17]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4078,The Picture of Dorian Gray,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray,"InVictorianEngland, Lord Henry Wotton observes artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a wealthy young man who is Basil's ultimatemuse. ThehedonisticLord Henry thinks thatbeautyis the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.

Under Lord Henry's influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performsShakespeareplays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian courts her and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him ""Prince Charming"". Her brother, James, warns that if ""Prince Charming"" harms her, he will murder him.

Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in a play.[a]Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, saying that acting is her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. Returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish came true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.

Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but is too late; she has killed herself. Rationalizing his cruelty, the young man decides that he has no need for love since his immortality protects him from any consequence. Dorian locks the portrait up, and for eighteen years, he experiments with everyvice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry gave him.

One night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgentsensualism. Dorian does not deny his debauchery and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil can only identify it as his by the signature on it. Horrified, Basil beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation; angered by Basil's reaction, Dorian stabs him to death. Dorian then blackmails an old friend, scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy Basil's body. Alan later kills himself.

To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to anopium den, where, unbeknownst to him, an older James Vane is present. James has been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl's death but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the nickname she called him. There, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as ""Prince Charming"". James accosts Dorian, who deceives him into believing he is too young to have known Sibyl, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian but is then approached by a woman from the den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms Dorian's identity and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years.

James begins to stalk Dorian, who starts to fear for his life. During a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells the elderly Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that he can never be truly redeemed as he only wishes to be absolved of his sins, without truly believing that what he has done is wrong.

Deciding that only a fullconfessionwill suffice, Dorian finds the knife with which he murdered Basil and stabs the picture in a bout of fury.

His servants awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard it calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. They identify the corpse as Dorian only by the rings on the fingers, while the portrait beside him is beautiful again.

Throughout the novel, Wilde delves into the themes of morality and influence, exploring how societal values, individual relationships, and personal choices intersect to shape one's own moral compass. Dorian initially falls under Lord Henry's influence and ""narcissistic perspective on art and life"", despite Basil's warnings, but ""eventually recognizes its limitations"".[24]Through Lord Henry's dialogue, Wilde is suggesting, as professor Dominic Manganiello pointed out, that creating art enacts the innate ability to conjure criminal impulses.[24]Dorian's immersion in the elite social circles of Victorian London exposes him to a culture of superficiality and moral hypocrisy.[25]Supporting this idea, Sheldon W. Liebman offered the example of Wilde's inclusion of a great psychological intellect held by Lord Henry. Before Sybil's death, Henry was also a firm believer in vanity as the origin of a human being's irrationality.[25]This concept is broken for Henry after Sybil is found dead, the irony being that Dorian is the cause of her death and his motives are exactly as Lord Henry has taught them to him.[25]

The novel presents other relationships that influence Dorian's way of life and his perception of the world, proving the influence of society and its values on a person. While Lord Henry is clearly a persona that fascinates and captures Dorian's attention, Manganiello also suggests that Basil is also a person that may ""evoke a change of heart"" in Dorian.[24]However, at this point in the novel, Dorian has spent far too much time under Lord Henry's wing and brushes Basil off in ""appositeness"", leading Basil to claim that man has no soul but art does.[24]Dorian's journey serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of hedonism and moral relativism, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility and moral accountability in navigating the complexities of human existence.[25]

The novel's representation ofhomoeroticismis subtle yet present by manifesting itself through interactions between male characters in a way that challenges the strict social norms ofVictorianEngland.[26]The novel begins with a conversation between Lord Henry and Basil, where Basil reveals his artistic admiration for Dorian, setting the scene for a story with themes such as beauty, art, and the consequences of vanity. The interaction introduces the characters and foreshadows the complicated relationship between the artist and his muse.[3]

It has been noted by scholars that Wilde possibly chose the protagonist's name, Dorian, in reference to theDoriansofancient Greece, argued to have been the first to introduce male same-sex initiation rituals to ancient Greek culture, being an allusion toGreek love.[27]

Similarly,gender rolesinfluence the relationships between characters and form their expectations and behaviors; in particular, the expectations of masculinity and the critique of the Victorian ideal of manhood are seen throughout the narrative.[28]Dorian, with his eternal youth and beauty, challenges traditional male roles and the slow decay of his portrait reflects the deception of societal expectations. Additionally, the few female characters in the story, such as Sybil, are portrayed in ways that critique the limited roles and harsh judgments reserved for women during that era.[28]The novel's exploration of these themes provides commentary on the structures of Victorian society, revealing the performative side of gender roles that restrict and define both men and women.[3][28]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849,The Trial,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial,"On the morning of his thirtieth birthday, Josef K., the chief clerk of a bank, is unexpectedly arrested by two agents from an unidentified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents discuss the situation with Josef in the unoccupied room of his fellow lodger Fräulein Bürstner, in the unexplained presence of three junior clerks from Josef's bank. Josef is not imprisoned, but left free to go about his business. His landlady, Frau Grubach, tries to console Josef about the trial. He visits Bürstner to explain the events, and then harasses her by kissing her without consent.

Josef finds that Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, has moved in with Fräulein Bürstner. He suspects that this is a coy manoeuvre meant to distance him from Bürstner, and resolves that she will eventually fall for his charms.

Josef is summoned to appear at the court's address the coming Sunday, without being told the time or location. After a period of exploration he finds the court in the attic of a dilapidated working-class tenement block, at the back of a young washerwoman's home. Josef is rebuked for his lateness and mistaken for a house painter rather than a bank clerk. He arouses the assembly's hostility after a passionate plea about the absurdity of the trial and the falseness of the accusation, despite still not knowing the charges. The proceedings are interrupted by a man sexually assaulting the washerwoman in a corner. Josef notices that all the assembly members are wearing pins on their lapels which he interprets as signifying their membership of a secret organisation.

The following Sunday Josef goes to the courtroom again, but the court is not in session. The washerwoman gives him information about the process and attempts to seduce him before a law student, the man who assaulted her the previous week, takes her away, claiming her to be his mistress. The woman's husband, a court usher, then takes Josef on a tour of the court offices, which ends after Josef becomes extremely weak in the presence of other court officials and defendants.

One evening, in a storage room at his own bank, Josef discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped for soliciting bribes from Josef, which he had complained about at court. Josef tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the storage room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the whipper and the two agents.

Josef is visited by his uncle Karl, who lives in the country. Worried by the rumors about his nephew, Karl introduces Josef to Herr Huld, a sickly and bedridden lawyer tended to by Leni, a young woman who shows an immediate attraction to Josef. During a conversation between Karl and Huld about Josef's case, Leni calls Josef away for a sexual encounter. Afterwards, Josef meets his angry uncle outside, who claims that Josef's lack of respect for the advocate, by leaving the meeting and romantically engaging with the woman who is apparently Huld's mistress, has hurt his case.

Josef has become increasingly preoccupied by his case, to the detriment of his work. He has further meetings with Huld, and continues to engage in discreet trysts with Leni, but the advocate's work appears to be having no effect on the proceedings. At the bank, one of Josef's clients recommends he seek the advice of Titorelli, the court's official painter. Titorelli outlines the options he can help Josef pursue: indefinite postponement of the process, or a temporary acquittal that could at any point result in re-arrest. Unequivocal acquittal is not a viable option.

Suspicious of the advocate's motives and the apparent lack of progress, Josef finally decides to dismiss Huld and take control of matters himself. Upon arriving at Huld's office, he meets a downtrodden merchant, Rudi Block, who offers Josef some insight from a fellow defendant's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of Josef for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons Josef's opinion of his lawyer.

Josef is put in charge of accompanying an important Italian client to the city's cathedral, but the client never meets him there. While inside the cathedral, a priest calls Josef by name and tells him a fable (which was published earlier as ""Before the Law"") that is meant to explain his situation. The priest tells Josef that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have interpreted it differently.

On the eve of Josef's thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. The three walk through the city, and Josef catches a brief glimpse of Fräulein Bürstner. They arrive at a small quarry outside the city, and the men kill Josef, stabbing him in the heart with a butcher's knife while strangling him. Josef summarizes his situation with his last words: ""Like a dog!"".

After a series of interrogations that take place over a period of six days, Marcus, Jolu, and Vanessa are finally released; Darryl's whereabouts are unknown. The DHS tells Marcus that they will be monitoring his actions and moves because he is still a suspect. Marcus is ""infuriated at how his civil rights [are] ignored.""[12]

In response to the increasing surveillance of the city and its citizens, Marcus creates Xnet, a privatemesh networkintended to allow people to communicate freely while fighting ""the surveillance state.""[13]Through XNet, using his pseudonym 'Mik3y', Marcus encourages his peers to rebel against the DHS surveillance.

Little Brotherhas major themes that, according to some, are too serious for ayoung adultnovel. In an interview, theJournal of Adolescent & Adult Literacyasked Doctorow about his ""potentially heavy themes, including paranoia, loyalty, sex, torture, [and] fear""[14]and when his editing staff asked to censor the themes, he replied, ""Oh, no.""

The Hollywood Reporterremarked, ""The book tackles many themes, including civil liberties and social activism"".[15]

According to journalist April Spisak's article on ""What Makes a Good Young Adult Dystopian Novel?"" Spisak claims, ""Cory Doctorow's Little Brother probably represents the purest example on the list—modern technology meets classic dystopic elements—even while the book itself is part instructional guide, part love story, and part rant at the increasingly dictatorial powers-that-be that consider safety at any cost a reasonable exchange. Small personal victories for the protagonist and his friends are present, but the power of Big Brother is hardly tempered by their work, and the folks who tangled with the government are all permanently scarred by the encounter.""[16]

The book has also been characterized as ""[expressing] astonishment, fear, uncertainty, shame, and guilt""[17]and addressing ""issues of political authority, social order, individual freedom and electronic security.""[18]

Little Brothertakes place in the ""near future rather than decades or centuries away.""[19]Little Brotheralso makes use of ""obvious parallels toOrwellianwarnings and post9/11policies.""[20]

Cindy Dobrez in her review forBooklistsaid that ""Doctorow's novel blurs the lines between current and potential technologies, and readers will delight in the details of how Marcus attempts to stage a techno-revolution. Obvious parallels to Orwellian warnings and post-9/11policies, such as thePatriot Act, will provide opportunity for classroom discussion and raise questions about our enthusiasm for technology, who monitors our school library collections, and how we contribute to our own lack of privacy.""[20]Kirkus Reviewsdescribed it as an ""unapologetically didactic tribute to1984"", and called it a ""Terrifying glimpse of the future—or the present.""[21]Publishers Weeklysaid that it was ""filled with sharp dialogue and detailed descriptions of how to counteractgait-recognition cameras, RFID's (radio frequency IDtags), wireless Internet tracers and other surveillance devices, this work makes its admittedly didactic point within a tautly crafted fictional framework.""[22]TheInstitute of Public Affairs, a thinktank, says that ""Doctorow, like many freedom-fighting writers before him likes his women smart and strong. Male or female, freedom-loving writers tend to like writing strong female characters, often protagonists.""[23]

In 2014, a high school principal inPensacola, Florida, Michael Roberts, pulledLittle Brotherfrom his school's summer reading list because the book is ""about questioning authority"" and portrays questioning authority ""as a positive thing.""; however it was kept on the list for advanced placement and grade 11 honors students. Roberts also described Cory Doctorow, a Canadian author living in England, as ""an outsider to theGeorge W. Bushadministration.""[24]In response, his publisher sent 200 copies of the book directly to the school.[25]

In early 2012, it was announced that the novelLittle Brotherwritten by Cory Doctorow will be made into a play directed by Josh Costello calledLittle Brother. The play was augmented with animated video projections, an original score by Chris Houston and original choreography by Daunielle Rasmussen.

Marin Independentsaid thatLittle Brotheris ""required watching!'[26]

Charlie Jane Andersofio9praised theLittle Brotherplay: ""I was lucky enough to catch a preview performance of the Custom Made Theatre Co.'s new stage adaptation of Cory Doctorow's award-winning novelLittle Brotherthe other day—and it was a total marvel. Somehow, writer/director Josh Costello managed to condense the novel down to a two-hour play, without losing any of the impact. If anything, the staged version hits a bit harder than the book, because of the intense, but not overstated, performances.""[27]

According toTheatreStorm, ""Costello has wisely tightened Doctorow's book to three main characters. On a nearly empty stage, Costello utilizes video and sound effects superbly, creating multiple San Francisco locations, mass demonstrations, press conferences, online experiences and coaching his actors to create multiple characterizations as necessary. This is the best kind of political theatre. Thought provoking, suspenseful, emotionally real, uncomfortably close to the hard truth.""[28]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146,A Little Princess,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess,"Captain Ralph Crewe, a wealthy Englishwidower, has been raising his only child, a daughter named Sara, inIndiawhere he is stationed with theBritish Army. Because the Indian climate is considered too harsh for their children, British families living there traditionally send their children to boarding school back home inEngland. The Captain enrolls his seven-year-old daughter at an all-girlsboarding schoolinLondonand dotes on his daughter so much that he orders and pays the haughtyheadmistress, Miss Minchin, for special treatment and exceptional luxuries for Sara, such as a private room for her with a personal maid and a separate sitting room (seeparlour boarder), along with Sara's own private carriage and a pony. Miss Minchin openly fawns over Sara for her money, but is secretly envious and dislikes Sara almost from the outset.

Intelligent, imaginative and kind, Sara sees through flattery and remains unspoiled; she embraces the status of a 'princess' accorded by the other students, and lives up to it with her compassion and generosity. She befriends Ermengarde, the schooldunce; Lottie, a four-year-old student given to tantrums; and Becky, the stuntedscullery maid.

Four years later, Sara's eleventh birthday is celebrated at Miss Minchin's with a lavish party. Just as it ends, Miss Minchin learns of Captain Crewe's unfortunate demise due tojungle fever. Furthermore, the previously wealthy captain has lost his entire fortune, investing in a friend's diamond mines. Preteen Sara is left an orphan and a pauper with nowhere to go. Miss Minchin is left with a sizable debt for Sara's school fees and luxuries, including her birthday party. Infuriated and pitiless, she takes away all of Sara's possessions (except for an old black frock and her doll, Emily), and makes her live in a cold and poorly furnished attic, forcing her to earn her keep by working as a servant.

For the next two years Miss Minchin starves and overworks Sara, turning her into a menial servant and unpaid tutor, with the prospect of turning her into an under-paid teacher when she is old enough. Most of the students take their tone from Miss Minchin, but Sara is consoled by her few friends and uses her imagination to cope with her bleak existence. She continues to be kind and polite to everyone, even her abusers, in the belief that conduct, not money, make a true princess. On one of the bleakest days when she herself is ravenous, she finds a coin and buys six buns, but gives a starving beggar-child five of them.

During this time Mr. Carrisford moves into the house next to the seminary. He is an extremely wealthy invalid come from abroad and retains Mr. Carmichael, a solicitor who lives nearby. Sara has often observed Mr. Carmichael's big and loving family, whom she has dubbed the ""Large Family"" – while they are equally curious about her and call her ""the little girl who is not a beggar"".

Mr. Carrisford is revealed to have been Captain Crewe's partner in the diamond mine venture. Thinking all was lost and both suffering from severe illness, Carrisford abandoned Captain Crewe and wandered in a delirium. When he recovered, it was to find Crewe dead – and the mines a reality. Extremely rich but suffering both ill health and pangs of conscience, he returns to England and makes it his mission to find Sara, though he does not know where to look.

Meanwhile Ram Dass, Mr Carrisford's Indian servant, climbs across the roof to retrieve a pet monkey which has taken refuge in Sara's attic. He sees the poor condition of her room and, touched by her courtesy and demeanor, sets out to discover her history. To distract his master from his own sorrows, he tells Mr Carrisford about the ""little girl in the attic"". Between them they devise a scheme whereby Mr Carrisford becomes ""The Magician"", a mysterious benefactor who transforms her barren existence with gifts of food and warmth and books – snuck in by Ram Dass.

One night the monkey again visits Sara's attic, and she decides to return it to Mr. Carrisford next morning. He learns that Sara is Captain Crewe's daughter; Sara also learns that Mr. Carrisford was her father's friend – and The Magician.

Miss Minchin pays a visit to collect Sara, but is informed that Sara will be living with Mr. Carrisford from now on; not only is her fortune restored, she is now heiress to diamond mines. Miss Minchin tries to retrieve the situation, going so far as to threaten legal action if she does not return to the school, and that she will never see any of her friends again, but Sara refuses and Mr Carrisford is adamant. Becky becomes Sara's personal servant and, with her newfound wealth, Sara makes a deal with a baker, proposing to cover the cost of food given to any hungry child.

Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted the book as one of its ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[5]In 2012 it was ranked number 56 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published bySchool Library Journal.[6]

The novella appears to have been inspired in part byCharlotte Brontë's unfinished novelEmma, the first two chapters of which were published inCornhill Magazinein 1860, featuring a rich heiress with a mysterious past who is apparently abandoned at a boarding school.[7]

Burnett first introducedSara Crewein 1888 in print.[8]She returned to the material in 1902, penning the three-act stage playA Little Un-fairy Princess, which ran in London over the autumn of that year. Around the time it transferred to New York City at the start of 1903 the title was shortened toA Little Princess. It wasA Little Princessin London, butThe Little Princessin New York.[citation needed]

Burnett said that after the production of the play on Broadway, her publisher, Charles Scribner's Sons, asked her to expand the story into a full-length novel and ""put into it all the things and people that had been left out before"".[9]The book was illustrated by Ethel Franklin Betts[9]and published in 1905 under the full titleA Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time.[10]

Due in part to the novel'spublic domainstatus, several musical versions ofA Little Princesshave emerged in recent years, including:

Some of these productions have made significant changes to the book, story and characters, most notably the Sickinger/Atkey version, which moves the action toCivil War-era America.

In addition,Princesses, a 2004 musical currently in development for Broadway, features students at a boarding school presenting a production ofA Little Princess. Music and book was by Cheri Steinkellner and Bill Steinkellner, and lyrics and direction byDavid Zippel.

In 1995, Apple published a series of three books written byGabrielle Charbonnet. ""The Princess Trilogy"" was an updated version of the classic, with the title character named Molly, rather than Sara. Molly Stewart's father was a famous film director who left his daughter in a posh upscale boarding school. There were three books in the series, which ended in a similar way as the original:Molly's Heart,The Room on the Attic, andHome at Last.

A sequel byHilary McKaywas published by Hodder Children's Books in September 2009:Wishing for Tomorrow: The Sequel to A Little Princess.[20]It tells the story of what happened to the rest of the boarding school girls after Sara and Becky left (""life must go on at Miss Minchin's"").

In 2017 a further sequel was published by Scholastic,The Princess and the SuffragettebyHolly Webb.[21]This centres on Lottie, the smallest girl in the original story, who is now 10 and learning about the Suffragettes. Sara makes some brief appearances."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8117,"The possessed :  or, The devils",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demons_(Dostoevsky_novel),"The novel is in three parts. There are two epigraphs, the first from Pushkin's poem ""Demons"" and the second from Luke 8:32–36.

After an almost illustrious but prematurely curtailed academic career Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky is residing with the wealthy landowner Varvara Petrovna Stavrogina at her estate, Skvoreshniki, in a provincial Russian town. Originally employed as a tutor to Stavrogina's son Nikolai Vsevolodovich, Stepan Trofimovich has been there for almost twenty years in an intimate but platonic relationship with his noble patroness. Stepan Trofimovich also has a son from a previous marriage but he has grown up elsewhere without his father's involvement.

A troubled Varvara Petrovna has just returned from Switzerland where she has been visiting Nikolai Vsevolodovich. She berates Stepan Trofimovich for his financial irresponsibility, but her main preoccupation is an ""intrigue"" she encountered in Switzerland concerning her son and his relations with Liza Tushina—the beautiful daughter of her friend Praskovya. Praskovya and Liza arrive at the town, without Nikolai Vsevolodovich who has gone to Petersburg. According to Praskovya, Varvara Petrovna's young protégée Darya Pavlovna (Dasha), has also somehow become involved with Nikolai Vsevolodovich, but the details are ambiguous. Varvara Petrovna suddenly conceives the idea of forming an engagement between Stepan Trofimovich and Dasha. Though dismayed, Stepan Trofimovich accedes to her proposal, which happens to resolve a delicate financial issue for him. Influenced by gossip, he begins to suspect that he is being married off to cover up ""another man's sins"" and writes ""noble"" letters to his fiancée and Nikolai Vsevolodovich. Matters are further complicated by the arrival of a mysterious ""crippled woman"", Marya Lebyadkina, to whom Nikolai Vsevolodovich is also rumoured to be connected, although no one seems to know exactly how. A hint is given when Varvara Petrovna asks the mentally disturbed Marya, who has approached her outside church, if she is Lebyadkina and she replies that she is not.

Varvara Petrovna takes Marya (and Liza who has insisted on coming with them) back to Skvoreshniki. Already present are Dasha, her older brother Ivan Shatov, and a nervous Stepan Trofimovich. Praskovya arrives, accompanied by her nephew Mavriky Nikolaevich, demanding to know why her daughter has been dragged in to Varvara Petrovna's ""scandal"". Varvara Petrovna questions Dasha about a large sum of money that Nikolai Vsevolodovich supposedly sent through her to Marya's brother, but in spite of her straightforward answers matters don't become any clearer. Marya's brother, the drunkard Captain Lebyadkin, comes looking for his sister and confuses Varvara Petrovna even further with semi-deranged rantings about some sort of dishonour that must remain unspoken. At this point the butler announces that Nikolai Vsevolodovich has arrived. To everyone's surprise, however, a complete stranger walks in and immediately begins to dominate the conversation. It turns out to be Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, Stepan Trofimovich's son. As he is talking, Nikolai Stavrogin quietly enters. Varvara Petrovna stops him imperiously and, indicating Marya, demands to know if she is his lawful wife. He looks at his mother impassively, says nothing, kisses her hand, and unhurriedly approaches Marya. In soothing tones he explains to Marya that he is her devoted friend, not her husband or fiancé, that she should not be here, and that he will escort her home. She agrees and they leave. In the din that breaks out after their departure, the strongest voice is that of Pyotr Stepanovich, and he manages to persuade Varvara Petrovna to listen to his explanation for what has occurred. According to him, Nikolai Vsevolodovich became acquainted with the Lebyadkins when he was living a life of ""mockery"" in Petersburg five years earlier. The downtrodden, crippled and half mad Marya had fallen hopelessly in love with him and he had responded by treating her ""like a marquise"". She began to think of him as her fiancé, and when he left he made arrangements for her support, including a substantial allowance, which her brother proceeded to appropriate as though he had some sort of right to it. Varvara Petrovna is elated and almost triumphant to hear that her son's actions had a noble foundation rather than a shameful one. Under interrogation from Pyotr Stepanovich, Captain Lebyadkin reluctantly confirms the truth of the whole story. He departs in disgrace as Nikolai Vsevolodovich returns from escorting Marya home. Nikolai Vsevolodovich addresses himself to Dasha with congratulations on her impending marriage, of which, he says, he was expressly informed. As if on cue, Pyotr Stepanovich says that he too has received a long letter from his father about an impending marriage, but that one cannot make sense of it—something about having to get married because of ""another man's sins"", and pleading to be ""saved"". An enraged Varvara Petrovna tells Stepan Trofimovich to leave her house and never come back. In the uproar that follows no-one notices Shatov, who has not said a word the entire time, walking across the room to stand directly in front of Nikolai Vsevolodovich. He looks him in the eye for a long time without saying anything, then suddenly hits him in the face with all his might. Stavrogin staggers, recovers himself, and seizes Shatov; but he immediately takes his hands away, and stands motionless, calmly returning Shatov's gaze. It is Shatov who lowers his eyes, and leaves, apparently crushed. Liza screams and collapses on the floor in a faint.

News of the events at Skvoreshniki spreads through society surprisingly rapidly. The main participants seclude themselves, with the exception of Pyotr Stepanovich who actively insinuates himself into the social life of the town. After eight days, he calls on Stavrogin and the true nature of their relations begins to become apparent. There was not, as some suspect, an explicit understanding between them. Rather Pyotr Stepanovich is trying to involve Stavrogin in some radical political plans of his own, and is avidly seeking to be of use to him. Stavrogin, while he seems to accept Pyotr Stepanovich acting on his behalf, is largely unresponsive to these overtures and continues to pursue his own agenda.

That night Stavrogin leaves Skvoreshniki in secret and makes his way on foot to Fillipov's house, where Shatov lives. The primary object of his visit is to consult his friend Kirillov, who also lives at the house. Stavrogin has received an extraordinarily insulting letter from Artemy Gaganov, the son of a respected landowner—Pavel Gaganov—whose nose he pulled as a joke some years earlier, and has been left with no choice but to challenge him to a duel. He asks Kirillov to be his second and to make the arrangements. They then discuss philosophical issues arising out of Kirillov's firm intention to commit suicide in the near future. Stavrogin proceeds to Shatov, and once again the background to the events at Skvoreshniki begins to reveal itself. Shatov had guessed the secret behind Stavrogin's connection to Marya (they are in fact married) and had struck him out of anger at his ""fall"". In the past Stavrogin had inspired Shatov with exhortations of the Russian Christ, but this marriage and other actions have provoked a complete disillusionment, which Shatov now angrily expresses. Stavrogin defends himself calmly and rationally, but not entirely convincingly. He also warns Shatov, who is a former member but now bitter enemy of Pyotr Verkhovensky's revolutionary society, that Verkhovensky might be planning to murder him. Stavrogin continues on foot to a distant part of town where he intends to call at the new residence of the Lebyadkins. On the way he encounters Fedka, an escaped convict, who has been waiting for him at the bridge. Pyotr Stepanovich has informed Fedka that Stavrogin may have need of his services in relation to the Lebyadkins, but Stavrogin emphatically rejects this. He tells Fedka that he won't give him a penny and that if he meets him again he will tie him up and take him to the police. At the Lebyadkins' he informs the Captain, to the Captain's horror, that in the near future he will be making a public announcement of the marriage and that there will be no more money. He goes in to Marya, but something about him frightens her and she becomes mistrustful. His proposal that she come to live with him in Switzerland is met with scorn. She accuses him of being an imposter who has come to kill her with his knife, and demands to know what he has done with her ""Prince"". Stavrogin becomes angry, pushes her violently, and leaves, to Marya's frenzied curse. In a fury, he barely notices when Fedka pops up again, reiterating his requests for assistance. Stavrogin seizes him, slams him against a wall and begins to tie him up. However, he stops almost immediately and continues on his way, with Fedka following. Eventually Stavrogin bursts into laughter: he empties the contents of his wallet in Fedka's face, and walks off.

The duel takes place the following afternoon, but no-one is killed. To Gaganov's intense anger, Stavrogin appears to deliberately miss, as if to trivialize the duel and insult his opponent, although he says it is because he doesn't want to kill anyone any more. He returns to Skvoreshniki where he encounters Dasha who, as now becomes apparent, is in the role of a confidant and ""nurse"" in relation to him. He tells her about the duel and the encounter with Fedka, admitting to giving Fedka money that could be interpreted as a down payment to kill his wife. He asks her, in an ironic tone, whether she will still come to him even if he chooses to take Fedka up on his offer. Horrified, Dasha does not answer.

Pyotr Stepanovich meanwhile is very active in society, forming relationships and cultivating conditions that he thinks will help his political aims. He is particularly focused on Julia Mikhaylovna Von Lembke, the Governor's wife. By flattery, surrounding her with a retinue and encouraging her exaggerated liberal ambition, he acquires a power over her and over the tone of her salon. He and his group of co-conspirators exploit their new-found legitimacy to generate an atmosphere of frivolity and cynicism in society. They indulge in tasteless escapades, clandestinely distribute revolutionary propaganda, and agitate workers at the local Spigulin factory. They are particularly active in promoting Julia Mikhaylovna's 'Literary Gala' to raise money for poor governesses, and it becomes a much anticipated event for the whole town. The Governor, Andrey Antonovich, is deeply troubled by Pyotr Stepanovich's success with his wife and casual disregard for his authority, but is painfully incapable of doing anything about it. Unable to cope with the strange events and mounting pressures, he begins to show signs of acute mental disturbance. Pyotr Stepanovich adopts a similarly destabilizing approach toward his father, driving Stepan Trofimovich into a frenzy by relentlessly ridiculing him and further undermining his disintegrating relationship with Varvara Petrovna.

Pyotr Stepanovich visits Kirillov to remind him of an ""agreement"" he made to commit suicide at a time convenient to the revolutionary society. He invites Kirillov, and subsequently Shatov, to a meeting of the local branch of the society to be held later that day. He then calls on Stavrogin, arriving just as Mavriky Nikolaevich, Liza's new fiancé, is angrily departing.  Stavrogin, however, seems to be in a good mood and he willingly accompanies Pyotr Stepanovich to the meeting. Present are a wide variety of idealists, disaffected types and pseudo-intellectuals, most notably the philosopher Shigalyev who attempts to expound his theory on the historically necessary totalitarian social organization of the future. The conversation is inane and directionless until Pyotr Stepanovich takes control and seeks to establish whether there is a real commitment to the cause of violent revolution. He claims that this matter can be resolved by asking a simple question of each individual: in the knowledge of a planned political murder, would you inform the police? As everyone else is hurrying to assert that they would of course not inform, Shatov gets up and leaves, followed by Stavrogin and Kirillov. Uproar ensues. Pyotr Stepanovich abandons the meeting and rushes after Stavrogin. Meeting them at Kirillov's place, where Fedka is also present, Verkhovensky demands to know whether Stavrogin will be providing the funds to deal with the Lebyadkins. He has acquired proof, in the form of a letter sent to Von Lembke, that the Captain is contemplating betraying them all. Stavrogin refuses, tells him he won't give him Shatov either, and departs. Verkhovensky tries to stop him, but Stavrogin throws him to the ground and continues on his way. Verkhovensky rushes after him again and, to Stavrogin's astonishment, suddenly transforms into a raving madman. He launches into an incoherent monologue, alternately passionately persuasive and grovelingly submissive, desperately pleading with Stavrogin to join his cause. The speech amounts to a declaration of love, reaching a climax with the exclamation ""Stavrogin, you're beautiful!"" and an attempt to kiss his hand. Verkhovensky's cause, it turns out, has nothing to do with socialism, but is purely about destroying the old order and seizing power, with Stavrogin, the iron-willed leader, at the helm. Stavrogin remains cold, but does not actually say no, and Pyotr Stepanovich persists with his schemes.

Social disquiet escalates as the day of the literary gala approaches. The Governor's assistant, under the false impression that Stepan Trofimovich is the source of the problem, orders a raid on his residence. Deeply shocked, Stepan Trofimovich goes to the Governor to complain. He arrives as a large group of workers from the Spigulin factory are staging a protest about work and pay conditions. Already in a precarious state of mind, Andrey Antonovich responds to both problems in a somewhat demented authoritarian fashion. Julia Mikhaylovna and her retinue, among whom are Varvara Petrovna and Liza, return from a visit to Skvoreshniki and the Governor is further humiliated by a public snubbing from his wife. As Julia Mikhaylovna engages charmingly with Stepan Trofimovich and the 'great writer' Karmazinov, who are to read at the Gala tomorrow, Pyotr Stepanovich enters. Seeing him, Andrey Antonovich begins to show signs of derangement. But attention is immediately diverted to a new drama: Stavrogin has entered the room, and he is accosted by Liza. In a loud voice she complains of harassment from a certain Captain Lebyadkin, who describes himself as Stavrogin's relation, the brother of his wife. Stavrogin calmly replies that Marya (née Lebyadkina) is indeed his wife, and that he will make sure the Captain causes her no further trouble. Varvara Petrovna is horrified, but Stavrogin simply smiles and walks out. Liza follows him.

The much vaunted literary matinée and ball takes place the next day. Most of the town has subscribed and all the influential people are present for the reading, with the exception of the Stavrogins. Julia Mikhaylovna, who has somehow managed to reconcile Andrey Antonovich, is at the summit of her ambition. But things go wrong from the beginning. Pyotr Stepanovich's associates Lyamshin and Liputin take advantage of their role as stewards to alter proceedings in a provocative way, and allow a lot of low types in without paying. The reading starts with the unscheduled appearance on stage of a hopelessly drunk Captain Lebyadkin, apparently for the purpose of reading some of his poetry. Realizing the Captain is too drunk, Liputin takes it upon himself to read the poem, which is a witless and insulting piece about the hard lot of governesses. He is quickly followed by the literary genius Karmazinov who is reading a farewell to his public entitled ""Merci"". For over an hour the great writer plods through an aimless stream of self-absorbed fantasy, sending the audience into a state of complete stupefaction. The torture only comes to an end when an exhausted listener inadvertently cries out ""Lord, what rubbish!"" and Karmazinov, after exchanging insults with the audience, finally closes with an ironic ""Merci, merci, merci."" In this hostile atmosphere Stepan Trofimovich takes the stage. He plunges headlong into a passionate exhortation of his own aesthetic ideals, becoming increasingly shrill as he reacts to the derision emanating from the audience. He ends by cursing them and storming off. Pandemonium breaks out as an unexpected third reader, a 'professor' from Petersburg, immediately takes the stage in his place. Apparently delighted by the disorder, the new orator launches into a frenzied tirade against Russia, shouting with all his might and gesticulating with his fist. He is eventually dragged off stage by six officials, but he somehow manages to escape and returns to briefly continue his harangue before being dragged off again. Supporters in the audience rush to his aid as a schoolgirl takes the stage seeking to rouse oppressed students everywhere to protest.

In the aftermath, Pyotr Stepanovich (who was mysteriously absent from the reading) seeks to persuade a traumatized Julia Mikhaylovna that it wasn't as bad as she thinks and that it is essential for her to attend the ball. He also lets her know that the town is ringing with the news of another scandal: Lizaveta Nikolaevna has left her home and fiancé and gone off to Skvoreshniki with Stavrogin.

Despite the disaster of the reading, the ball goes ahead that evening, with Julia Mikhaylovna and Andrey Antonovich in attendance. Many of the respectable public have chosen not to attend but there is an increased number of dubious types, who make straight for the drinking area. Hardly anyone is dancing, most are standing around waiting for something to happen and casting curious glances at the Von Lembkes. A 'literary quadrille' has been especially choreographed for the occasion, but it is vulgar and stupid and merely bemuses the onlookers. Shocked by some of the antics in the quadrille and the degenerating atmosphere in the hall, Andrey Antonovich lapses back into his authoritarian persona and a frightened Julia Mikhaylovna is forced to apologise for him. Someone shouts ""Fire!"" and the news quickly spreads that a large fire is raging in part of the town. There is a stampede for the exits, but Andrey Antonovich screams that all must be searched, and when his distressed wife calls out his name he orders her arrest. Julia Mikhaylovna faints. She is carried to safety, but Andrey Antonovich insists on going to the fire. At the fire he is knocked unconscious by a falling beam, and although he later recovers consciousness, he does not recover his sanity, and his career as governor comes to an end. The fire rages all night, but by morning it has dwindled and rain is falling. News begins to spread of a strange and terrible murder: a certain Captain, his sister and their serving maid have been found stabbed to death in their partially burned down house on the edge of town.

Stavrogin and Liza have spent the night together and they wake to the dying glow of the fire. Liza is ready to leave him, convinced that her life is over. Pyotr Stepanovich arrives to impart the news of the Lebyadkins' murder. He says the murderer was Fedka the Convict, denies any involvement himself, and assures Stavrogin that legally (and of course morally) he too is in the clear. When Liza demands the truth from Stavrogin, he replies that he was against the murder but knew it was going to happen and didn't stop the murderers. Liza rushes off in a frenzy, determined to get to the place of the murders to see the bodies. Stavrogin tells Pyotr Stepanovich to stop her, but Pyotr Stepanovich demands an answer. Stavrogin replies that it might be possible to say yes to him if only he were not such a buffoon, and tells him to come back tomorrow. Appeased, Pyotr Stepanovich pursues Liza, but the attempt to stop her is abandoned when Mavriky Nikolaevich, who has been waiting for her outside all night, rushes to her aid. He and Liza proceed to the town together in the pouring rain. At the scene of the murders an unruly crowd has gathered. By this time it is known that it is Stavrogin's wife who has been murdered, and Liza is recognized as 'Stavrogin's woman'. She and Mavriky Nikolaevich are attacked by drunk and belligerent individuals in the crowd. Liza is struck several times on the head and is killed.

Most of society's anger for the night's events is directed toward Julia Mikhaylovna. Pyotr Stepanovich is not suspected, and news spreads that Stavrogin has left on the train for Petersburg. The revolutionary crew, however, are alarmed. They are on the point of mutiny until Pyotr Stepanovich shows them Lebyadkin's letter to Von Lembke. He points to their own undeniable involvement and tells them that Shatov is also determined to denounce them. They agree that Shatov will have to be killed and a plan is made to lure him to the isolated location where he has buried the society's printing press. Pyotr Stepanovich explains that Kirillov has agreed to write a note taking responsibility for their crimes before he commits suicide. Shatov himself is preoccupied with the unexpected return of his ex-wife Marie, who has turned up on his doorstep, alone, ill and poverty-stricken. He is overjoyed to see her, and when it turns out that she is going into labour with Stavrogin's child he frantically sets about helping her. The child is born and, reconciled with Marie, he is happy that he is going to be the father. That night the emissary from the revolutionary group—Erkel—arrives to escort Shatov to the isolated part of Skvoreshniki where the printing press is buried. Thinking this will be his final interaction with the society, Shatov agrees to come. As he shows Erkel the spot, the other members of the group jump out and grab him. Pyotr Verkhovensky puts a gun to Shatov's forehead and fires, killing him. As they clumsily weight the body and dump it in the pond, one of the participants in the crime—Lyamshin—completely loses his head and starts shrieking like an animal. He is restrained and eventually quietened, and they go their separate ways. Early the following morning Pyotr Stepanovich proceeds to Kirillov's place. Kirillov has been forewarned and is eagerly awaiting him. However, his aversion to Pyotr Stepanovich and the news of Shatov's death arouse a reluctance to comply, and for some time they parley, both with guns in hand. Eventually Kirillov seems to be overcome by the power of his desire to kill himself and despite his misgivings he hurriedly writes and signs the suicide note taking responsibility for the crimes, and runs into the next room. But there is no shot, and Pyotr Stepanovich cautiously follows him into the darkened room. A strange and harrowing confrontation ends with Pyotr Stepanovich fleeing in a panic. A shot rings out and he returns to find that Kirillov has shot himself through the head.

Meanwhile, Stepan Trofimovich, oblivious to the unfolding horrors, has left town on foot, determined to take the high road to an uncertain future. Wandering along with no real purpose or destination, he is offered a lift by some peasants. They take him to their village where he meets Sofya Matveyevna, a travelling gospel seller, and he firmly attaches himself to her. They set off together but Stepan Trofimovich becomes ill and they are forced to take a room at a large cottage. He tells Sofya Matveyevna a somewhat embellished version of his life story and pleads with her not to leave him. To his horror, Varvara Petrovna suddenly turns up at the cottage. She has been looking for him since his disappearance, and her ferocity greatly frightens both Stepan Trofimovich and Sofya Matveyevna. When she realizes that he is extremely ill and that Sofya Matveyevna has been looking after him, her attitude softens and she sends for her doctor. A difficult reconciliation between the two friends, during which some painful events from the past are recalled, is effected. It becomes apparent that Stepan Trofimovich is dying and a priest is summoned. In his final conscious hours he recognizes the deceit of his life, forgives others, and makes an ecstatic speech expressing his re-kindled love of God.

When Shatov fails to return, Marie, still exhausted from the birth, seeks out Kirillov. Encountering the terrible scene of the suicide, she grabs her newborn baby and rushes outside into the cold, desperately seeking help. Eventually the authorities are called to the scene. They read Kirillov's note and a short time later Shatov's body is discovered at Skvoreshniki. Marie and the baby become ill, and die a few days later. The crime scene at Skvoreshniki reveals that Kirillov must have been acting with others and the story emerges that there is an organized group of revolutionary conspirators behind all the crimes and disorders. Paranoia grips the town, but all is revealed when Lyamshin, unable to bear it, makes a groveling confession to the authorities. He tells the story of the conspiracy in great detail, and the rest of the crew, with the exception of Pyotr Stepanovich who left for Petersburg after Kirillov's suicide, are arrested.

Varvara Petrovna, returning to her town house after Stepan Trofimovich's death, is greatly shaken by all the terrible news. Darya Pavlovna receives a disturbing letter from Nikolai Vsevolodovich, which she shows to Varvara Petrovna. News arrives from Skvoreshniki that Nikolai Vsevolodovich is there and has locked himself away without saying a word to anyone. They hurry over, and find that Nikolai Vsevolodovich has hanged himself.

The editor ofThe Russian Messenger,Mikhail Katkov, refused to publish the chapter ""At Tikhon's"".[53]The chapter concerns Stavrogin's visit to the monk Tikhon at the local monastery, during which he confesses, in the form of a lengthy and detailed written document, to taking sexual advantage of a downtrodden and vulnerable 11-year-old girl—Matryosha—and then waiting and listening as she goes through the process of hanging herself. He describes his marriage to Marya Lebyadkina as a deliberate attempt to cripple his own life, largely as a consequence of his inability to forget this episode and the fear he experienced in its aftermath.[54]Dostoevsky considered the chapter to be essential to an understanding of the psychology of Stavrogin, and he tried desperately but unsuccessfully to save it through revisions and concessions to Katkov. He was eventually forced to drop it and rewrite parts of the novel that dealt with its subject matter.[55]He never included the chapter in subsequent publications of the novel, but it is generally included in modern editions as an appendix. It has also been published separately, translated from Russian to English by S.S. Koteliansky andVirginia Woolf, with an essay on Dostoevsky bySigmund Freud.[56]

Dostoevsky wrote to Maykov that the chief theme of his novel was ""the very one over which, consciously and unconsciously, I have been tormented all my life: it is the existence of God.""[57]Much of the plot develops out of the tension between belief and non-belief, and the words and actions of most of the characters seem to be intimately bound to the position they take up within this struggle.

Dostoevsky saw atheism as the root cause of Russia's deepening social problems. He further wrote to Maykov on October 9, 1870: ""a man who loses his people and his national roots also loses the faith of his fathers and his God.""[58]It is in this letter that he speaks, referring primarily to Stavrogin and secondarily to Stepan Verkhovensky, of the 'Russian Man' as comparable to the man possessed by demons who is healed by Jesus in the parable of the swine. InDemonsthe Russian man has lost his true national identity (inextricably linked, for Dostoevsky, with the Orthodox Christian faith) and tries to fill the void with ideas derived from Western modes of thought—Catholicism, atheism, scientism, socialism, idealism, etc.  As teachers and strong personalities, Stavrogin and Stepan Trofimovich influence those around them, and thus the demons enter the swine. Only at the end, after a heartfelt acknowledgment of their fault, are they given the possibility of redemption—Stavrogin when Tikhon offers him life as a Christian renunciate (an offer that Stavrogin refuses) and Stepan Trofimovich as he approaches death.[59]

Instead of belief in God, Stavrogin has rationality, intellect, self-reliance, and egoism, but the spiritual longing and sensual ardour of his childhood, over-stimulated by his teacher Stepan Trofimovich, has never left him.[60][61]Unfettered by fear or morality, his life has become a self-centred experiment and a heartless quest to overcome the torment of his growing ennui.[62]The most striking manifestation of his dilemma is in the dialogue with Tikhon, where we find him, perhaps for the only time, truthfully communicating his inner state. In this dialogue there is an alternation in his speech between the stern, worldly voice of rational self-possession and the vulnerable, confessional voice of the lost and suffering soul.[63][64]

Many of the other characters are deeply affected by one or other of the two aspects of Stavrogin's psyche. The nihilist Pyotr Verkhovensky is in love with the cynical, amoral, power-seeking side, while Shatov is affected by the ardour of the feeling, spiritually-bereft side. Shatov ""rose from the dead"" after hearing Stavrogin's uncompromising exhortation of Christ as the supreme ideal (an assertion made in a futile effort to convince himself: he succeeds in convincing Shatov but not himself).[65]Conversely, Kirillov was convinced by Stavrogin's exhortation of atheism—the supremacy of Man's will, not God's—and forges a plan to sacrifice himself to free humanity from its bondage to mystical fear. But Stavrogin himself does not even believe in his own atheism, and as Shatov and Tikhon recognize, drives himself further into evil out of a desire to torture himself and avoid the truth. Kirillov sums up Stavrogin's dilemma thus: ""If Stavrogin believes, then he doesn't believe that he believes. But if he doesn't believe, then he doesn't believe that he doesn't believe.""[66]

Dostoevsky saw Russia's growing suicide rate as a symptom of the decline of religious faith and the concomitant disintegration of social institutions like the family.[67]Self-destruction as a result of atheism or loss of faith is a major theme inDemonsand further recalls the metaphor of the demon-possessed swine in the epigraph.[68]

In addition to a number of extended dialogues on the subject, mostly involving Kirillov, there are four actual suicides described in the novel. The first is in anecdotal form, told by the narrator after the pranksters associated with Julia Mikaylovna pay a visit to the scene of a suicide. Entrusted with a large sum of money by his family, a hitherto quiet and responsible young man deliberately squanders it all on riotous living over a period of several days. Returning to his hotel, he calmly and politely orders a meal and some wine, writes a short note, and shoots himself through the heart.

The first plot-related suicide is that of Kirillov. Kirillov is a kind of philosopher of suicide and, under questioning from several interlocutors (the narrator, Stavrogin, Pyotr Verkhovensky), expounds his ideas on the subject, mostly as it relates to him personally but also as a general phenomenon. According to him there are two types of people who commit suicide: those who do it suddenly upon being overwhelmed by an unbearable emotion, and those who do it after much thought for good reason. He thinks that everyone could fall into the latter category if it were not for two prejudices: fear of pain, and fear of the next world. ""God"" he says, ""is the pain of the fear of death. Whoever conquers pain and fear will himself become God."" In his mind he is the man who, by his own intentional death, will demonstrate to humanity the transcendence of pain and fear and free them of the need to invent God.[69]

Stavrogin's suicide at the end of the novel is only fully understood with reference to the censored chapter. The enormity of his crimes, the desolation of his inner being, the madness born of his ""sacrilegious, proto-Nietzschean attempt to transcend the boundaries of good and evil"", are hidden realities that only become visible in the confession and dialogue with Tikhon.[70]Despite this 'madness', it is 'rationality' that is emphasized in the narrator's description of the suicide itself. The efficiency of the procedure, the brief, precise note, and the subsequent medical opinion of his mental state emphatically ruling out madness, all point to his 'reasonable' state of mind at the time of the act.

The final suicide is that of the little girl Matryosha, described by Stavrogin in his confessional letter. After her encounter with Stavrogin, she tells her mother that she has ""killed God"". When she hangs herself Stavrogin is present in the next room and aware of what she is doing.

A common criticism ofDemons, particularly from Dostoevsky's liberal and radical contemporaries, is that it is exaggerated and unrealistic, a result of the author's over-active imagination and excessive interest in the psycho-pathological. However, despite giving freedom to his imagination, Dostoevsky took great pains to derive the novel's characters and story from real people and real ideas of the time. According to Frank, ""the book is almost a compressed encyclopedia of the Russian culture of the period it covers, filtered through a witheringly derisive and often grotesquely funny perspective, and it creates a remarkable 'myth' of the main conflicts of this culture reconstructed on a firm basis of historical personages and events.""[71]

Almost all of the principal characters, or at least their individual guiding ideas, had actually existing contemporary prototypes. Stavrogin was partly based on Dostoevsky's comrade from the Petrashevsky Circle,Nikolay Speshnev, and represented an imagined extreme in practice of an amoral, atheistic philosophy like that ofMax Stirner.[72]The darkness of Stavrogin is confronted by the radiance of Bishop Tikhon, a character inspired byTikhon of Zadonsk.

Of Pyotr Verkhovensky, Dostoevsky said that the character is not a portrait of Nechayev but that ""my aroused mind has created by imagination the person, the type, that corresponds to the crime... To my own surprise he half turns out to be a comic figure.""[73]Most of the nihilist characters associated with Pyotr Verkhovensky were based on individuals who appeared in the transcripts of the trial of the Nechayevists, which were publicly available and studied by Dostoevsky. The character of Shatov represents a Russian nationalist response to socialist ideas, and was initially based on Nechayev's victim Ivanov, but later on the contemporaryslavophileideas ofDanilevsky[43]and to some extent on Dostoevsky's own reformed ideas about Russia.

Stepan Verkhovensky began as a caricature of Granovsky, and retained the latter's neurotic susceptibilities, academic interests, and penchant for writing long confessional letters, but the character was grounded in the idealistic tendencies of many others from the generation of the 1840s, including Herzen,Belinsky,Chaadaev, Turgenev, and Dostoevsky himself.[74]Liberal figures like Stepan Trofimovich, Varvara Petrovna, Liputin, Karmazinov, and the Von Lembkes, and minor authority figures like the old Governor Osip Osipovich and the over-zealous policeman Flibusterov, are parodies of a variety of establishment types that Dostoevsky held partially responsible for the excesses of the radical generation. Karmazinov was an openly hostile parody of Turgenev—his personality and mannerisms, his perceived complicity with nihilism, and, in the Gala reading scene, the style of some of his later literary works.[75]

Even the most extreme and unlikely characters, such as Kirillov and Shigalev, were grounded in real people or ideas of the time. Kirillov was initially inspired by a Nechayev associate who spoke openly at the trial of his plan to commit suicide, but the apocalyptic philosophy the character builds around his obsession is grounded in an interpretation of the anthropotheistic ideas ofFeuerbach.[76]Shigalev was initially based on the radical critic V.A. Zaitsev who advocated a form ofSocial Darwinismthat included, for example, an argument that without the protection of slavery the black race would become extinct due to its inherent inferiority.[77]Shigalev's notion of human equality, the ""earthly paradise"" in which nine tenths of humanity are to be deprived of their will and turned into a slave-herd by means of a program of inter-generational 're-education', had a contemporary prototype in the ideas ofPetr Tkachev. Tkachev argued that the only biologically possible 'equality' for human beings was ""an organic, physiological equality conditioned by the same education and common living conditions"" and he saw this as the supreme goal of all historical and social progress.[78]

Kjetsaa claims that Dostoevsky did not regardRevelationas ""merely a consolatory epistle to first century Christians during the persecution they suffered"", but as a ""prophecy being fulfilled in his own time"".[79]Dostoevsky wrote that ""Communism will conquer one day, irrespective of whether the Communists are right or wrong. But this triumph will stand very far from the Kingdom of Heaven. All the same, we must accept that this triumph will come one day, even though none of those who at present steer the world's fate have any idea about it at all.""[80]

Since theRussian Revolution, many commentators have remarked on the prophetic nature ofDemons.André Gide, writing in the early 1920s, suggested that ""the whole of (the novel) prophesies the revolution of which Russia is presently in the throes"".[81]InSovietRussia, a number ofdissidentauthors found a prototype for the Sovietpolice statein the system expounded by Shigalev at the meeting of Pyotr Verkhovensky's revolutionary society.Boris Pasternak,Igor Shafarevich, andAlexander Solzhenitsyn, have called Dostoevsky's description of Shigalevism prophetic, anticipating the systematicpoliticidewhich followed theOctober Revolution. Pasternak often used the term ""Shigalevism"" (shigalevshchina) to refer toJoseph Stalin'sGreat Purge.[82][83][84]According to Richard Pevear, Dostoevsky even presaged the appearance ofLeninhimself with his description of the final reader at the ill-fated literary gala: ""a man of about forty, bald front and back, with a grayish little beard, who...keeps raising his fist over his head and bringing it down as if crushing some adversary to dust.""[85]

Dostoevsky biographer Ronald Hingley described the novel as ""an awesome, prophetic warning which humanity, no less possessed of collective and individual devilry in the 1970s than in the 1870s, shows alarmingly few signs of heeding.""[86]Robert L. Belknapnotes its relevance to the twentieth century in general, ""when a few Stavrogins empowered thousands of Pyotr Stepanovichs to drive herds of 'capital', to use Nechayev's term, to slaughter about a hundred million people, the very number Shigalyev and Pyotr hit upon.""[87]In his bookDostoyevsky in ManhattanFrench philosopherAndré Glucksmannargued that 'nihilism', as depicted inDemons, is the underlying idea or 'characteristic form' of modern terrorism.[88]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4276,North and South,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_and_South_(Gaskell_novel),"Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale has lived for almost 10 years in London with her cousin Edith and her wealthy Aunt Shaw, but when Edith marries Captain Lennox, Margaret happily returns home to the southern village of Helstone. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother Henry, an up-and-comingbarrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves theChurch of Englandand therectoryof Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him adissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend fromOxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and is in the middle of the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.[13]

Margaret initially finds the bustling, smoky town of Milton harsh and strange, and she is upset by its poverty. Mr. Hale (in reduced financial circumstances) works as a tutor; one of his pupils is the wealthy and influential manufacturer John Thornton, master of Marlborough Mills. From the outset, Margaret and Thornton are at odds with each other; she sees him as coarse and unfeeling, and he sees her as haughty. He is attracted to her beauty and self-assurance, however, and she begins to admire how he has risen from poverty.

During the 18 months she spends in Milton, Margaret gradually learns to appreciate the city and its hard-working people, especially Nicholas Higgins (aunionrepresentative) and his daughter Bessy, whom she befriends. Bessy is ill withbyssinosisfrom inhaling cotton dust, which eventually kills her.

A workers' strike ensues. An outraged mob of workers breaks into Thornton's compound, where he has his home and his factory, after he imports Irish workers as replacements. Thornton sends for soldiers, but before they arrive, Margaret begs him to talk to the mob to try to avoid bloodshed. When he appears to be in danger, Margaret rushes out and shields him; she is struck by a stone. The mob disperses, and Thornton carries the unconscious Margaret indoors.

Thornton proposes; Margaret declines, unprepared for his unexpected declaration of love and offended by assumptions that her action in front of the mob meant that she cares for him. Thornton's mother, wary of Margaret's haughty ways, is galled by Margaret's rejection of her son.

Margaret's brother Frederick (who lives in exile as he is wanted for his part in a naval mutiny) secretly visits their dying mother. Thornton sees Margaret and Frederick together and assumes that he is her lover. Leonards, Frederick's shipmate, later recognises Frederick at the train station. They argue; Frederick pushes Leonards away, and Leonards dies shortly afterwards. When the police question Margaret about the scuffle, she lies and says she was not present. Thornton knows that Margaret lied, but in his capacity as magistrate, declares the case closed to save her from possible perjury. Margaret is humbled by his deed on her behalf; she no longer merely looks down on Thornton as a hard master, but begins to recognise the depth of his character.

Nicholas, at Margaret's behest, approaches Thornton for a job and eventually obtains one.  Thornton and Higgins learn to appreciate and understand each other.

Mr. Hale visits his oldest friend, Mr Bell, in Oxford. He dies there, and Margaret returns to live in London with Aunt Shaw. She visits Helstone with Mr. Bell and asks him to tell Thornton about Frederick, but Mr Bell dies before he can do so. He leaves Margaret a legacy which includes Marlborough Mills and the Thornton house.

Thornton faces bankruptcy, due to market fluctuations and the strike. He learns the truth about Margaret's brother from Nicholas Higgins and comes to London to settle his business affairs with Margaret, who is his new landlord. When Margaret offers to lend Thornton some of her money, he realises that her feelings towards him have changed, and he again proposes marriage. Since she has learned to love him, she accepts.

In her introduction toThe Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell(2007), a collection of essays representing current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author's growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime. It was not always that way;[14]her reputation from her death to the 1950s was dominated byLord David Cecil's assessment inEarly Victorian Novelists(1934) that she was ""all woman"" and ""makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain"".[15]

Contemporary reviews were critical, similar to those ofMary Barton. A scathing, unsignedcritiqueinThe Leaderaccused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not ""understand industrial problems"", would ""know too little about the cotton industry"" and had no ""right to add to the confusion by writing about it"".[3]

After reading the fifth episode,Charlotte Brontëbelieved that it was only about the church and ""the defence of those who in conscience, disagree with it and consider it their duty to leave"". However, Brontë acknowledged that her friend ""understands the genius of the North"".[16]Although Richard Holt acknowledged some interest in the novel inThe Critical Review, he complained that its plot is disjointed and the characters change by leaps and bounds ""in the manner of kangaroos"".[16]George Sandsaid that the novel could interest a gentleman while being accessible to a young woman.[17]

Gaskell's novels, with the exception ofCranford, gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with ""good judgment and feminine sensibilities"". Archie Stanton Whitfield wrote that her work was ""like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar"" in 1929,[18]and Cecil said that she lacked the ""masculinity"" necessary to properly deal with social problems.[19]However, the tide began to turn in Gaskell's favour when, in the 1950s and 60s, socialist critics likeKathleen Tillotson,Arnold KettleandRaymond Williamsre-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels,[20]and—realising that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time—saw it as preparing the way for vocalfeminist movements.[21]In the early 21st century, with Gaskell's work ""enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities"",[22]North and South, one of the first industrial novels describing a conflict between employers and workers, is seen as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell's most mature creation.[23]

The change in title of Gaskell's fourth novel fromMargaret Haleto Dickens' suggestedNorth and South[2]underscores its theme of modernity versus tradition. Until the end of the 18th century, power in England was in the hands of thearistocracyandlanded gentrybased in the south. The Industrial Revolution unsettled the centuries-oldclass structure, shifting wealth and power to manufacturers who mass-produced goods in the north. Cities such as Manchester, on which Gaskell modelled her fictional Milton, were hastily developed to house workers who moved from the semi-feudal countryside to work in the new factories. The south represents the past (tradition): aristocratic landowners who inherited their property, collected rent from farmers and peasants and assumed an obligation for their tenants' welfare. The north represents the future (modernity): its leaders were self-made men like Gaskell's hero, John Thornton, who accumulated wealth as working, middle-class entrepreneurs. In their view, philanthropy or charity – giving something for nothing – was a dangerous imbalance of the relationship between employers and employees (which was based on the exchange of cash for labour).[24]

Rebellion against an authority seen as unfair is woven throughout the story. Established institutions are seen as inhumane or selfish, and therefore fallible;[25]Mr. Hale breaks with the church on a matter of conscience, and Frederick Hale participates in a mutiny against the navy and is forced into exile because the law would hang him for what he considered a just cause. His rebellion parallels the strike by workers who take up the cause to feed their children. Both are impotent and engaged in a struggle (a war, in the eyes of the workers) whose terms are dictated by those who maintain their power by force: the law and the mill masters.[26]Margaret rebels in ways that express her liberty: ignoring social proprieties and challenging authority by lying to the police to protect her brother, from whom she learns that arbitrary, unjust, and cruel power can be defied not for oneself but on behalf of the unfortunate. Even Mrs. Hale rebels in her own way; she is ""prouder of Frederick standing up against injustice, than if he had been simply a good officer"".

The theme of power is also central. Thornton represents three aspects of power and the authority of the ruling class: a manufacturer respected by his peers (economic power), a magistrate (judicial power) and someone who can summon the army (political power) to quell the strike.[27]There is energy, power and courage in the struggle for a better life by Milton's residents. Margaret demonstrates power in her verbal jousting with Thornton, forcing him to reflect on the validity of his beliefs and eventually change his view of workers from mere providers of labour to individuals capable of intelligent thought.[28]When she reaches age 21, Margaret takes control of her life, resolves to live as she chooses, and learns how to manage wealth inherited from Mr. Bell.

The notion ofseparate spheresdominated Victorian beliefs about gender roles, assuming that the roles of men and women are clearly delineated.[29]Public life (including work) is within the masculine domain, and private life (domesticity) is within the feminine. The expression of feelings is considered feminine, and aggression is seen as masculine. Resolving conflict with words is feminine, and men are likely to resort to physical resolution (including war). The mistress of the home is the guardian of morality and religion and ""The Angel in the House"". The public sphere is considered dangerously amoral and, in the work of authors such as Dickens, disasters ensue when characters do not conform to contemporary standards.[29]

This notion is questioned inNorth and South. In Margaret Hale, the separation is blurred and she is forced by circumstances to assume a masculine role, organising the family's departure from Helstone and assuming much of the responsibility for the family in Milton (including encouraging her father). She carries the load alone, behaving like a ""Roman girl"" because Mr. Hale is weak and irresolute. When Higgins slips away and her father trembles with horror at Boucher's death, Margaret goes to Mrs. Boucher, breaks the news of her husband's death, and cares for the family with dedication and efficiency. She summons her brother Frederick, a naval officer who is crushed with grief at the death of his mother. To protect her brother, Margaret later lies about their presence at the train station on the day of his departure.[30]

Thornton and Higgins, while not denying their masculinity, demonstrate compassion. Higgins in particular, whom Thornton considers among ""mere demagogues, lovers of power, at whatever costs to others"", assumes the responsibility for raising the Boucher children and embodies maternal tenderness (lacking in Mrs. Thornton) and strength (not possessed by Mrs. Hale) and dignity. Gaskell endows John Thornton with tenderness (a soft spot, according to Nicholas Higgins). Although Thornton's pride hides this capacity from public view, he shows it in his affection for his mother and his quiet attention to the Hales. He expresses it more obviously when he later develops relations with his workers beyond the usual cash-for-labour, builds a canteen for the workers, and sometimes shares meals with them. Margaret and Thornton's evolution eventually converges and, after learning humility, they are partially freed from the shackles of separate spheres; he develops friendly relations at the mill, and she asserts her independence from her cousin's life. Margaret initiates their business meeting, which he interprets as a declaration of love.[31]In the final scene, she controls the financial situation and he reacts emotionally. They now meet as man and woman, no longer the manufacturer from the north and the lady from the south. The blurring of roles is also evident among the workers, many of whom (like Bessy) are women.

Certain family relationships are emphasised (Margaret and her father, Higgins and Bessy, Mrs. Hale and Frederick), all interrupted by death. The tie between Thornton and his mother is particularly deep and, on Mrs. Thornton's side, exclusive and boundless: ""her son, her pride, her property"".[32]Ordinarily cold, she tells him: ""Mother's love is Given by God, John. It holds fast for ever and ever"". Parent-child relationships are oftenmetaphorsfor relations between employers and workers in Victorian literature.[33]In chapter XV, ""Men and Master"", Margaret rejects this paternalistic view (expressed by Thornton) as infantilising the worker. She favours, instead, helping workers grow and become emancipated.[34]Friendships between people of different social classes, education and cultural backgrounds (between Mr. Hale and Thornton, Margaret and Bessy, and Thornton and Higgins) prefigure Gaskell's desired human relations which blur class distinctions. Margaret performs ""lowly"" tasks and Dixon becomes a confidante of Mrs. Hale, who develops a relationship of respect, affection, and understanding with the maid.[35]

Gaskell, the daughter, and wife of a pastor, did not write a religious novel, although religion plays an important role in her work.[36]Unitarians interpreted biblical texts symbolically, rather than literally.[37]They did not believe inoriginal sinor that women were guiltier or weaker than men, and were more liberal thanMethodists,AnglicansorDissenters.[38]North and Southpresents a typical picture of Unitarian tolerance in one evening scene: ""Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel, knelt down together"".[39]The Thorntons do not invoke religion as the Hales do, although Mrs. Thornton readsMatthew Henry'sExposition of the Old and New Testaments. Although the re-institution in 1850 byPope Pius IXof a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England was generally strongly condemned, Gaskell has an open mind about Catholicism and Frederick Hale converts to his Spanish wife's religion.[40]

Biblical references appear in several forms. Chapter VI cites theBook of Job, ii. 13); there is an allusion to the elder brother in theParable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity (""that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own"") from theFirst Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads theApocalypseto cope with her condition and interprets the parable ofDives and Lazarusso simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: ""It won't be division enough, in that awful day, that some of us have been beggars here, and some of us have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ"". Margaret and Thornton follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their ""unworthiness"".[41]Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes.Francis de Salesencourages her to seek ""the way of humility"", despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation (""Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very"") and gives fervent thanks for the ""great blessing"" his existence gives her.

The influence ofJane Austen'sPride and PrejudiceonNorth and Southis frequently noted.[42]From plot points such as Margaret refusing Thornton's first proposal, to the protagonists' character traits, the parallels between the two novels are clear. Margaret and Elizabeth Bennet both share haughty, intelligent, but prejudiced natures, while Thornton is proud, reticent and powerful like Darcy. According to Nils Clausson in ""Romancing Manchester: Class, Gender, and the Conflicting Genres of Elizabeth Gaskell'sNorth and South"", the ""same romance plot - a rich, proud man subdued by a strong-willed, independent and intelligent woman - reappears half a century later [thanPride and Prejudice] inNorth and South""(3).Clausson asserts that Austen created the prototypical romance which Gaskell ""transposed to mid-Victorian Manchester"" (3). Combining romance with the conflicting realism of the social problem novel, Gaskell updates and complicates the earlier plot, a point explored at length by Matthew Sussman in ""Austen, Gaskell, and the Politics of Domestic Fiction.""[43]InThe Politics of Stories in Victorian Fiction(1988), Rosemarie Bodenheimer writes that she prefers to study the novel's relationship withCharlotte Brontë'sShirleybut sees in the ""description of strong domestic qualities"" and ""social optimism"" an industrialPride and Prejudice.[44]Patricia Ingham also comparesNorth and SouthtoShirley.[45]Ann Banfield comparesNorth and SouthtoMansfield Parkfor two reasons: Margaret Hale, likeFanny Price, is transplanted in a place she conquers, and the novel is built on an opposition of places on a larger scale.[46]

The novel has three beginnings, two of them illusory: the first is the wedding preparation in London, the second the heroine's return to Helstone and the third (often considered the real start of the story) narrates the departure for Milton in chapter seven.[47]The first chapters, according to Martin Dodsworth, are false leads of what the novel is about rather than the author's clumsiness; they tell the reader what the story isnotabout. Bodenheimer interprets the early chapters not as false starts but as demonstrating Gaskell's theme of societal and personal ""permanent state(s) of change"" and integral to the novel.[44]The early chapters in different places have been interpreted as presenting a theme of mobility.[48]In moving from one place to another Margaret better understands herself and the world, advancing Gaskell's intention to place her in the public sphere.

The opening chapters ofNorth and Southindicate an apparentnovel of mannersin the style of Jane Austen,[49]with preparations for the marriage in London of a silly bride and a lively, intelligent heroine; in the country village of Helstone (a fictional place in the English county ofHampshire), a bachelor in search of fortune (Henry Lennox) woos – and is rejected by – Margaret.[47]Deirdre David, inFictions of Resolution in Three Victorian Novels(1981), suggests that Margaret's abandonment of London society indicates that she is out of place in the south and her adjustment to the north is plausible.[46]

Gaskell's novel of manners has the broader context of an industrial novel about the north-west of England, where young girls (like Bessy) die of ""cotton consumption""; capitalists disregard legal obligations, and workers refuseprophylacticfacilities, instigate strikes and foment riots.[47]It can be criticised, as by Martin Dodsworth,[where?]for giving the love affair precedence over the industrial context and for dwelling on the emotional conflict between Margaret and Thornton. However,North and Southis not simply an industrialPride and Prejudice.Margaret acquires stature and a public role, challenging the Victorian idea of separate spheres.[50]She befriends Bessy Higgins (a young, working-class woman), gradually abandons her aversion to ""shoppy people"" and, recognising Thornton's qualities, crossessocial classesto consider herself ""not good enough"" for him. Although the novel ends in Harley Street (where it began), Margaret's estrangement from the vain, superficial world of her cousin Edith and Henry Lennox is emphasised by her choice of Thornton and Milton.[51]

As the chapter titles ""First Impressions"", ""Mistakes"", ""Mistakes Cleared Up"", ""Mischances"" and ""Atonement"" indicate thatNorth and Southis peppered with Margaret's blunders and problematic situations with other characters which create misunderstandings. Some of Margaret's blunders stem from ignoring customs, some from not understanding them and still others from rejecting Milton's social customs (such as a frank, familiar handshake). Other characters fail to carry out important actions: Dixon does not tell Margaret that Thornton attended her mother's funeral, and Mr. Bell dies before he can explain to Thornton why Margaret lied. Margaret feels misunderstood, unable to take control of her life and explain a world she does not understand.[52]

Other gaffes are due to Margaret's ignorance; accustomed to London's chic salons, she is unaware that she is seen as wearing her shawl ""as an empress wears her drapery"" and serving tea with ""the air of a proud reluctant slave"". She receives marriage proposals awkwardly: Henry Lennox's declaration of love is ""unpleasant"" and makes her uncomfortable, and she feels ""offended"" and assaulted by John Thornton's proposal. Margaret naively believes that the rioters can be negotiated with and is unaware that she and her brother, Frederick, resemble a loving couple on a train-station platform (O'Farrell, 1997, p. 68). Bodenheimer sees this ""mistakenness"" as purposeful: ""In its every situation, whether industrial politics or emotional life, traditional views and stances break down into confusing new ones, which are rendered in all the pain of mistakenness and conflict that real human change entails"".[44]Perhaps this is why Margaret's blunders do not always have negative consequences;[53]when she admits she is disappointed that Thornton has refused to hire Higgins, she is ashamed that he hears her remark. Thornton reconsiders, eventually offering Higgins a job. In the final chapter, she does not seem to realise that a ""simple proposition"" to bail out the factory (a business arrangement) could hurt Thornton's pride or be seen as shocking from a ""lady"". Bodenheimer interprets scenes like this as ""deep confusion in a time of personal change and revision""[44]which brings the lovers together.[53]

The first description of Marlborough Mills in Chapter XV is through Margaret's eyes and thoughts, and the omniscient narrator delves into the inner thoughts of her main characters and occasionally interjects her observations.[44]Thornton ""thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly, but he was mistaken. It was a stinging pleasure to be in the room with her ... But he was no great analyser of his own motives, and was mistaken as I have said"". The narrative sometimes slips intofree indirect discourse; Mrs. Thornton silently calls Margaret's embroidery of a small piece ofcambric""flimsy, useless work"" when she visits the Hales.

Bodenheimer believes that the narrator is interested in the psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world.[44][54]also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of ""interiority"" (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' ""trance of passion"". The phrase ""as if"" appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration: ""Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk"" and ""[Thornton] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical"".[55]The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: ""As if she felt his look, she turned to him""; ""He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it"", and ""She lifted up her head as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown"". Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins: "" ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart"".[56]

According to Bodenheimer,North and South'snarrative may sometimes appear melodramatic and sentimental (""But, for all that—for all his savage words, he could have thrown himself at her feet, and kissed the hem of her garment"" in chapter 29)—particularly in the riot scene—but she sees Gaskell's best writing as ""done with the unjudging openness to experience"" which the author shares withD. H. Lawrence.[44]Jill L. Matus finds Gaskell's vocabulary ""Gothicised"" in its descriptions of the characters' agonised inner life—their responses to suffering and pain—which may appear melodramatic out of context.  However, ""the language of shock and horror is absorbed into the realist texture of the novel's narration"" and is consistent with the extreme conditions of the novel's external world.[57]

A number of 19th-century authors were interested in nativedialects:ScottishforSir Walter Scott,IrishforMaria Edgeworth. Gaskell, influenced by her husband's work, did not hesitate to give her Milton workersMancunianexpressions and vocabulary without going as far asEmily Brontë's transcription ofYorkshirepronunciation[58]or Dickens'Yarmouthfishermen inDavid Copperfield.[59]She developed a reputation for the skilful use of dialect to indicate status, age or intimacy between speakers.[60]

Margaret's adaptation to the culture is demonstrated through language.[61]When her mother reproaches her for using Milton's vulgar provincialisms (such as ""slack of work""), Margaret replies that since she lives in an industrial city, she must speak its language when called on to do so.[62]She cites a word which may be vulgar but which she finds expressive (""knobstick"") and uses a local term (""redding up"" – tidying) to Boucher's small children: ""redding up the slatternly room"". Gaskell begins each chapter with a poetic quote to accentuate a relevant theme, such as interior conflicts (""My heart revolts within me, and two voices / Make themselves audible within my bosom""—Wallenstein, chapter XVIII), duality (""On earth is known to none / The smile that is not sister to a tear."" Elliott, chapter XXI), courtship, duty, suffering, steadfast courage, honesty, time and change.

Gaskell lived during the period of upheaval which followed the Industrial Revolution, and was aware of the difficult conditions of daily life[63]and the health problems suffered by the workers of Manchester.[64]North and Southhas been interpreted by Roberto Dainotto as ""a kind of apocalyptic journey into the inferno of the changing times—modern poverty, rage, desperation, militant trade unionism and class antagonism"".[65]The strike described inNorth and Southresembles thePreston strike, which occurred the year before the novel was published.[66]The strike's slogan was ""ten per cent and no surrender"", and it was led by George Cowell andMortimer Grimshaw. Lasting nearly seven months (from September 1853 to April 1854), it was ultimately unsuccessful.[67]

The strike is described in detail, with intelligent leaders like Higgins, the desperate violence and savagery of the rioters, and the reactions of both sides. Through the eyes of Margaret, a horrified, compassionate outsider, Gaskell illustrates the social misery of theslums[68]Margaret visits, misery occasionally documented in parliamentary papers (blue books) with suggestive illustrations which resulted in theFactory Act 1833.[69]

Gaskell uses a cause of conflict between masters and workers (the installation of ventilators in the carding rooms) to illustrate the greed of one and the ignorance of the other, making social progress difficult, and calls attention to anti-Irish prejudice in a city where the Irish are a small minority.[70]She exposes the beliefs and reasoning of manufacturers in Thornton's defence of a theory approachingsocial Darwinism: capitalism as naturally (almost physically) obeying immutable laws, a relentless race to progress in which humanity is sacrificed; the weak die, whether they are masters or workers. Mrs. Thornton expresses the middle-class view of the working class as ""a pack of ungrateful hounds"".

North and Southbelongs to the canon of ""condition of England"" novels (also known as social-problem, industrial orsocial novels) which analyse Victorian social realities, offering ""first-hand detailed observations of industrialism, urbanism, class, and gender conflicts"".[71][72]It attempts to answer questions posed by contemporary changes[73]positioning itself between the individual worker freedom championed byJohn Stuart Mill(author ofThe Claims of Labor, published in theEdinburgh Reviewin 1845) and developed by Thornton in Chapter 15 and the responsibility of employers to their employees promoted byJohn RuskinandArthur Helps.[74]It represents a certainpaternalism, challenging the cutoff between public and private spheres, freedom and responsibility, workplace and family life, trying to define a balance in relations between employers and workers.[75]Through Margaret and her father, Gaskell criticises theautocraticmodel which infantilises workers and is defended by Thornton (who does not feel accountable to his workers for his actions or decisions). She advocates for an authority which takes into account the needs of workers, a social and economic contract as advocated byJohn LockeinTwo Treatises of Government, where masters and workers are in solidarity. After the strike, Thornton finally acknowledges that ""new forms ofnegotiationbetween management and labor are part of modern life"";[76]the strike, which ruined him, was ""respectable"" because the workers depend on him for money and he depends on them to manufacture his product.[77]

In the class struggle which victimises some (such as Boucher and Bessy), Gaskell does not offer definitiveconflict resolution:[78]Thornton's hope for strikes, for instance, is that they no longer be ""bitter and venomous"". He and Higgins reach a level of understanding beyond a ""cash nexus"" through Margaret's ""ongoing involvement in the process ofsocial change"" by urging communication between masters and workers.[79]If the holders of economic power agree to talk to their workers, to consider them as human beings (not tools of production), it may not eliminate social conflicts but will reduce their brutality.[80]The protagonists experience personal transformations which unite them in the end,[44]what Stoneman calls a ""balanced emancipation"".[81]

According to Catherine Barnes Stevenson, Gaskell may have found women doing factory work problematic; she often referred to ""masters and men"" and used one dying factory worker (Bessy) to represent women workers, who constituted more than half the factory workers at the time.[82]Stevenson wrote that Gaskell's relative silence on female factory workers may reflect her struggle with the ""triumph of the domestic ideology"" by the middle class of the mid-1800s. Gaskell hints at the difficulties families such as the Hales have keeping female domestic workers (like Dixon) in their proper –  subordinate – place and becoming like members of the family (blurring class differences), a scenario facing industrial workers as well.[73]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19839,Emma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(novel),"Emma Woodhouse's friend and former governess, Miss Taylor, has just married Mr. Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage and decides that she likesmatchmaking. After returning home to Hartfield, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of her friend Mr. Knightley, whose brother is married to Emma's elder sister, Isabella. She attempts to match her new friend, Harriet Smith, to Mr. Elton, the localvicar. Emma persuades Harriet to refuse a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable young farmer, although Harriet likes him. Mr. Elton, a social climber, mistakenly believes Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma reveals she believed him attached to Harriet, he is outraged, considering Harriet socially inferior. After Emma rejects him, Mr. Elton goes toBathand returns with a pretentious,nouveau-richewife, as Mr. Knightley expected he would do. Harriet is heartbroken, and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her.

Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son, arrives for a two-week visit. Frank was adopted by his wealthy and domineering aunt and has had few opportunities to visit before. Mr. Knightley tells Emma that, while Frank is intelligent and engaging, he has a shallow character. Jane Fairfax also arrives to visit her aunt Miss Bates and grandmother Mrs. Bates for a few months before starting a governess position due to financial situation. She is the same age as Emma and has received an excellent education through her father's friend, Colonel Campbell. Emma has remained somewhat aloof from Jane because she envies her and is annoyed by everyone, including Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, praising Jane. Mrs. Elton takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find a governess post before it is wanted.

Emma decides that Jane and Mr. Dixon, Colonel Campbell's new son-in-law, are mutually attracted, and that is the reason she arrived earlier than expected. She confides this to Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells atWeymouththe previous year; he apparently agrees with Emma. Suspicions are further fuelled when a gifted piano, sent anonymously, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last. The Eltons treat Harriet poorly, culminating in Mr. Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at a ball. Mr. Knightley, who normally refrained from dancing, gallantly asks Harriet to dance. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, as she fainted after a rough encounter with localgypsies. Emma mistakes Harriet's gratitude to Frank as Harriet being in love with him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston wonders if Mr. Knightley is attracted to Jane, but Emma dismisses the idea. When Mr. Knightley says he notices a connection between Jane and Frank, Emma disagrees, as Frank appears to be courting her instead. Frank arrives late to a gathering at Donwell, while Jane departs early. The next day atBox Hill, a local scenic spot, Frank and Emma are joking when Emma thoughtlessly insults Miss Bates.

When Mr. Knightley scolds Emma for insulting Miss Bates, she is ashamed. The next day, she visits Miss Bates to atone for her bad behaviour, impressing Mr. Knightley. During the visit, Emma learns that Jane has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs. Elton's friends. Jane becomes ill and refuses to see Emma or receive her gifts. Meanwhile, Frank has been visiting his aunt, who dies soon after his arrival. He and Jane reveal to the Westons that they have been secretly engaged since autumn, but Frank knew his aunt would disapprove of the match. Maintaining the secrecy strained the conscientious Jane and caused the couple to quarrel, with Jane ending the engagement. Frank's easygoing uncle readily gives his blessing to the match. The engagement is made public, leaving Emma annoyed to discover that she had been so wrong.

Emma believes Frank's engagement will devastate Harriet, but instead, Harriet says she loves Mr. Knightley, and though she knows the match is too unequal, Emma's encouragement and Mr. Knightley's kindness have given her hope. Emma is startled and realises that she is also in love with Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley returns to console Emma about Frank and Jane's engagement, thinking her heartbroken. When she admits her foolishness, he proposes, and she accepts. Harriet accepts Robert Martin's second proposal, and they are the first couple to marry. Jane and Emma reconcile, and Frank and Jane visit the Westons. Once the mourning period for Frank's aunt ends, they will marry. Before the end of November, Emma and Mr. Knightley are married with the prospect of ""perfect happiness.""

Emma Woodhouse, the protagonist of the story, is a beautiful, high-spirited, intelligent, and somewhat spoiled young woman from thelanded gentry. She is twenty when the story opens. Her mother died when she was young. She has been mistress of the house (Hartfield) since her older sister got married. Although intelligent, she lacks the discipline to practise or study anything in depth. She is portrayed as compassionate to the poor, but at the same time has a strong sense of class status. Her affection for and patience towards her valetudinarian father are also noteworthy. While she is in many ways mature, Emma makes some serious mistakes, mainly due to her lack of experience and her conviction that she is always right. Although she has vowed she will never marry, she delights in making matches for others. She has a brief flirtation with Frank Churchill; however, she realises at the end of the novel that she loves Mr Knightley.

Mr Knightley, aged 37 years, is Emma's neighbour and close friend. He is her only critic. Mr Knightley owns Donwell Abbey, which includes extensive grounds and farms. He is the elder brother of Mr John Knightley, the husband of Emma's elder sister Isabella. Mr Knightly is considerate, aware of the feelings of the other characters, and always exhibits good behaviour and judgment. Mr Knightley is angry after Emma persuades Harriet to turn down Mr Martin, a farmer on the Donwell estate; he warns Emma against pushing Harriet towards Mr Elton, knowing that Mr Elton seeks to marry for money. He is suspicious of Frank Churchill and his motives; he suspects that Frank has a secret understanding with Jane Fairfax.

Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son by his first marriage, is an amiable young man, who, at age 23, is liked by almost everyone. Mr Knightley, however, thinks him immature and selfish for failing to visit his father after his father's wedding. After his mother's death, he was raised by his wealthy aunt and uncle, the Churchills, at the family estate of Enscombe in Yorkshire. His uncle was his mother's brother. By his aunt's decree, he assumed the name Churchill on his majority. Frank is given to dancing and living a carefree existence, and is secretly engaged to Miss Fairfax atWeymouth, although he fears his aunt will forbid the match because Jane is not wealthy. He manipulates and plays games with the other characters to ensure his engagement to Jane remains concealed.

Jane Fairfaxis an orphan whose only family is her aunt, Miss Bates, and her grandmother, Mrs Bates. She is a beautiful, bright, and elegant woman, with impeccable manners. She is the same age as Emma. She is well-educated and talented at singing and playing the piano; she is the only person whom Emma envies. Colonel Campbell, an army friend of Jane's father, felt responsible for Jane, and provided her an excellent education while she has shared his home and family since she was nine years old. She has little fortune, however, and is destined to become a governess – an unpleasant prospect. The secret engagement goes against her principles and distresses her greatly.

Harriet Smith, a young friend of Emma, just seventeen when the story opens, is a beautiful but unsophisticated girl. She has been a pupil at a nearby school, where she met the sisters of Mr Martin. As a parlour boarder at the school she now helps supervise younger pupils. Emma takes Harriet under her wing early on, and she becomes the subject of Emma's misguided matchmaking attempts. She is revealed in the last chapter to be the natural daughter of a decent tradesman, although he is not a gentleman. Harriet and Mr Martin are wed. The now wiser Emma approves of the match.

Robert Martinis a well-to-do, 24-year-old tenant farmer who, though not a gentleman, is a friendly, amiable and diligent young man, well esteemed by Mr George Knightley. He becomes acquainted and subsequently smitten with Harriet during her 2-month stay at Abbey Mill Farm, which was arranged at the invitation of his sister, Elizabeth Martin, Harriet's school friend. His first marriage proposal, in a letter, is rejected by Harriet under Emma's direction and influence (an incident which puts Mr Knightley and Emma in a disagreement with one another). Emma had convinced herself that Harriet's class and breeding were above associating with the Martins, much less marrying one. His second marriage proposal is later accepted by a contented Harriet and approved by a wiser Emma; their joining marks the first of the three happy couples to marry in the end.

Reverend Philip Eltonis a good-looking, initially well-mannered, and ambitious young vicar, 27 years old and unmarried when the story opens. He is well aware of his good looks and status, and it is only when he is around men that he shows his true colours and reveals his schemes to marry a wealthy woman. Emma wants him to marry Harriet; however, he aspires to secure Emma's hand in marriage to gain her dowry of £30,000. Mr Elton displays his mercenary nature by quickly marrying another woman of means after Emma rejects him.

Augusta Elton, formerly Miss Hawkins, is Mr Elton's wife. She has 10,000 pounds ""or thereabouts"" (the vague description of her dowry perhaps suggests she is not as wealthy as she claims), but lacks good manners, committing common vulgarities such as using people's names too intimately (as in ""Jane"", not ""Miss Fairfax""; ""Knightley"", not ""Mr Knightley""). She is a boasting, pretentious woman who expects her due as a new bride in the village. Emma is polite to her but does not like her and the two instantly become passive-aggressive enemies. She patronises Jane, which earns Jane the sympathy of others. Her lack of social graces shows the good breeding of the other characters, particularly Miss Fairfax and Mrs Weston, and shows the difference between gentility and money. Mrs Elton repeatedly makes contradictory and unbelievable declarations about her background, such as exaggerated claims of the similarity between Emma's estate, Hartfield, and her brother-in-law's manor, Maple Grove, revealing her dishonesty and enforcing the idea that she is a schemingparvenutrying her utmost to conceal her lower origins.

Mrs Westonwas Emma's governess for sixteen years as Miss Anne Taylor and remains her closest friend and confidante after she marries Mr Weston. She is a sensible woman who loves Emma. Mrs Weston acts as a surrogate mother to her former charge and, occasionally, as a voice of moderation and reason. The Weston and the Woodhouse families see each other almost daily. Near the end of the story, the Westons' baby Anna is born.

Mr Westonis a widower and a businessman living in Highbury who marries Miss Taylor in his early 40s, after buying a house called Randalls. By his first marriage, he is father to Frank Weston Churchill, who was adopted and raised by his late wife's brother and his wife. He sees his son in London each year. He married his first wife, Miss Churchill, when he was a captain in the militia, posted near her home. Mr Weston is a sanguine, optimistic man, who enjoys socialising, making friends quickly in business and among his neighbours.

Miss Batesis a friendly, garrulous spinster whose mother, Mrs Bates, is a friend of Mr Woodhouse. Her niece is Jane Fairfax, daughter of her late sister. She was raised in better circumstances in her younger days as the vicar's daughter; now she and her mother rent rooms in Highbury. One day, Emma humiliates her on a day out in the country, when she alludes to her tiresome prolixity.

Mr Henry Woodhouse, Emma's father, is always concerned for his health, and to the extent that it does not interfere with his own, the health and comfort of his friends. He is a valetudinarian (i.e., similar to a hypochondriac but more likely to be genuinely ill). He assumes that a great many things are hazardous to his health, especially draughts of wind. Emma gets along with him well, and he loves both his daughters. He laments that ""poor Isabella"" and especially ""poor Miss Taylor"" have married and live away from him. He is a fond father and fond grandfather who did not remarry when his wife died; instead he brought in Miss Taylor to educate his daughters and become part of the family. Because he is generous and well-mannered, his neighbours accommodate him when they can.

Isabella Knightley (née Woodhouse)is the elder sister of Emma, by seven years, and daughter of Henry. She is married to John Knightley. She lives in London with her husband and their five children (Henry, 'little' John, Bella, 'little' Emma, and George). She is similar in disposition to her father, and her relationship to Mr Wingfield, (her family's physician) mirrors that of her father's to Mr Perry.

John Knightleyis Isabella's husband and George's younger brother, 31 years old. He is a lawyer (either a barrister or solicitor) by profession. Like the others raised in the area, he is a friend of Jane Fairfax. He greatly enjoys the company of his family, including his brother and his Woodhouse in-laws, but is not a very sociable man. He is forthright with Emma, his sister-in-law.

Mr Perryis the apothecary in Highbury. He is never shown directly speaking but spends a significant amount of time responding to the health issues of Mr Woodhouse. He and Mrs Perry have several children. He is also the subject of a discussion between Miss Bates and Jane Fairfax that is relayed in a letter to Mr Frank Churchill which he inadvertently discloses to Emma, thus risking discovery of his link with Jane Fairfax. He is described as an ""...intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse's life.[6]""

Mrs Batesis the widow of the former vicar of Highbury, the mother of Miss Bates and the grandmother of Jane Fairfax. She is old and hard of hearing, but is a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse when Emma attends social activities without him.

Mr & Mrs Colehave been residents of Highbury for several years, but have recently benefited from a significant increase in their income that has allowed them to expand the size of their house, number of servants and other expenses. Despite their ""low origin"" in trade, their income and style of living have made them the second most prominent family in Highbury, next to the Woodhouses at Hartfield. They host a dinner party that is a significant plot element.

Mrs Churchillwas the wife of the brother of Mr Weston's first wife. She and her husband, Mr Churchill, live at Enscombe in Yorkshire and raised Mr Weston's son, Mr Frank Churchill after the death of Frank's mother. Although never seen directly, she makes demands on Frank Churchill's time and attention that prevent him from visiting his father. Her potential disapproval is the reason that the engagement between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is kept secret. Her death provides the opportunity for the secret to be revealed.

Colonel and Mrs Campbellwere friends of Jane Fairfax's late father. Since Jane was their guest for extended visits, they took over her education in preparation for her working as a governess when she grew up. They provided her every advantage possible, short of adoption, and were very fond of her.

Mrs Goddardis the mistress of a boarding school for girls in which Harriet Smith is one of the pupils. She is also a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse along with Mrs Bates.

Mr William Larkinsis an employee on the Donwell Abbey estate of Mr Knightley. He frequently visits the Bateses, bringing them gifts, such as apples, from Mr Knightley.

Emmawas written after the publication ofPride and Prejudiceand was submitted to the London publisherJohn Murray IIin the autumn of 1815.  He offered Austen £450 for this plus the copyrights ofMansfield ParkandSense and Sensibility, which she refused.  Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray.  The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set induodecimoat the selling price of £1.1s (oneguinea) per set.[7]

Prior to publication, Austen's novels had come to the attention of thePrince Regent, whose librarian at Carlton House, aMr Clarke, showed her around the Library at the Prince Regent's request, and who suggested a dedication to the Prince Regent in a future publication.  This resulted in a dedication ofEmmato the Prince Regent at the time of publication and a dedication copy of the novel sent to Carlton House in December 1815.[8]

In America, copies of this first publication were sold in 1818 for $4 per copy, as well as an American edition published byMathew Careyof Philadelphia in 1816.  The number of copies of this edition are not known.  A later American edition was published in 1833[9]and again in 1838 by Carey, Lea, and Blanchard.[10]A French version was published in 1816 by Arthus Bertrand, publisher for MadameIsabelle De Montolieu.[11]A second French version for the Austrian market was published in 1817 Viennese publisher Schrambl.[12]

Richard BentleyreissuedEmmain 1833, along with Austen's five other novels, in his series of Standard Novels. This issue did not contain the dedication page to the Prince Regent.[13]These editions were frequently reprinted up until 1882 with the final publication of the Steventon Edition.[14]Emmahas remained in continuous publication in English throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In addition to the French translation already mentioned,Emmawas translated into Swedish and German in the nineteenth century and into fifteen other languages in the twentieth century including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German and Italian.[15]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26272,The Spy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_(Cooper_novel),"The action takes place during theAmerican Revolution, at ""The Locusts"", which was the name given to a Colonial-style home in Scarsdale, New York, that was built in 1787 by American Major William Popham, an officer who served on the staff of generals George Clinton and George Washington and who served as the 7th President-General of theSociety of Cincinnati, the oldest patriotic organization in the United States. The plot ranges back and forth over the neutral ground between theBritishand theContinental armiesas the home stands between those lines.

An unknown man, known as Mr. Harper, asks for shelter at The Locusts amidst a storm. Mr. Wharton (aLoyalist, his daughters Sarah and Frances, and sister-in-law Miss Peyton, agree to admit him into their home. They are suspicious of him and are cautious in discussing the revolution in his presence. Soon, a peddler named Harvey Birch comes along, with an unknown man, also seeking shelter. Harper eyes him carefully. The stranger is really Henry Wharton, a British army captain. Harper leaves the family, but not before revealing he was already aware of the true identity of Captain Wharton. Birch, who has met privately with Mr. Harper for unknown reasons, strongly urges Captain Wharton to return to his post.

A group of American troops investigates the home of Birch, before making their way to The Locusts. There, Major Peyton Dunwoodie is confronted by Frances Wharton, who loves him and sympathizes with the Patriot cause. She pleads with him not to arrest or harm her brother, Captain Wharton, but Dunwoodie feels his duty too strongly. He learns that Captain Wharton has disguised himself and used a letter forged withGeorge Washington's signature to avoid being found. Dunwoodie realizes that Washington's signature is authentic, however, but the Captain cannot explain how he procured it. Dunwoodie arrests Captain Wharton but learns that British troops are in the area. Dunwoodie rushes to assist his fellow colonists, allowing Captain Wharton to escape in the confusion. Captain Wharton tells his commanding officer, Colonel Wellmere, to be on the lookout of Dunwoodie and his troops. Wellmere does not take his advice and skirmish ensues; he is injured and Captain Wharton is recaptured by Captain Lawton. As Wellmere's troops make their retreat, Dunwoodie brings his friend Captain Singleton to The Locusts to be cared for by Dr. Sitgreaves. Frances suggests summoning Singleton's sister to assist.

Harvey Birch comes under suspicion for being a British spy although he is really a Patriot. Harper is revealed to be Washington in disguise with whom Birch has other meetings in the course of the book. Birch's role is revealed only after he falls in battle.[2]

Harvey Birch, peddler and patriot, is a character remotely founded uponEnoch Crosby, a real spy who helped John Jay. The publisher H. L. Barnum stated that a gentleman of ""good standing and respectability"" and a personal friend of Cooper had claimed that the author himself told him of the inspiration. Barnum wrote of the connection in 1828 in his bookThe Spy Unmasked; or, Memoirs of Enoch Crosby, Alias Harvey Birch, The Hero of Mr. Cooper's Tale of the Neutral Ground: Being an Authentic Account of the Secret Services Which He Rendered to his Country During the Revolutionary War (Taken from His Own Lips, in Short-Hand).[3]Cooper would again take up the subject of the American Revolution in his novelThe Pilot: A Tale of the Sea(1823–4), also inspired by historical figures.[4]

Cooper began writingThe Spyas early as June 1820, shortly after publishing his bookPrecaution. In a contemporary letter toSamuel Griswold Goodrich, Cooper wrote he had ""commenced another tale to be called the 'Spy'"" with the ""scene [set] in West-Chester County, and [at the] time of the revolutionary war.""[5]The work-in-progress was inspired with persuasion from his wife, Susan, who Cooper referred to as his ""female Mentor"".[6]Cooper's choice of subject was directly in response to critics of his first book, who wished he would write on more American subjects. Patriotism, Cooper vowed, would be his main theme.[7]He anticipated that the book would be superior to his previous effort but admitted to Goodrich on July 12, 1820, that work on the book ""goes on slowly"" and it would not be finished until the fall.[8]

The novel was successful, and its success came at a critical time in Cooper's life. He was straining to maintain his gentlemanly lifestyle after the collapse of his family fortune, and he wrote his first two novels to test the viability of income from authorship.[9]The original print run of 1000 copies sold out in the first month, with at least 600 copies sold within a year, which earned him royalties of $4000.[10]Years later, in 1831, Cooper gave credit for the book's success on the ""love of country"" among his American readers.[11]The Literary Worldlater reflected that the book was among the first to celebrate the United States in such a way: ""Before 'The Spy' we believe there is scarcely to be found a book from an American pen, in which there is an attempt to delineate American character or scenery, or which selects the soil of the United States as the field of its story"".[12]A review in theNorth American Reviewnoted the book ""laid the foundations of American romance"".[7]

The book's central character, Harvey Birch, prefigures many of the qualities that Cooper would use in his more famous character,Natty Bumppo, who stars in Cooper's series of books known asLeatherstocking Tales. Birch is an adventurer who resists marrying and traditional society to withdraw into his own natural, moral world.[13]

The Spywas a direct influence onJohn Neal, who published his own Revolutionary Warhistorical fictionnovel,Seventy-Six, two years later in 1823 after he had received the requested feedback on the manuscript from Cooper.[14]Neal's novel provided a stark contrast to Cooper's work in its use of American colloquial language, profanity, and conversational narration and earned him a reputation as Cooper's chief rival as leading American author.[15]Neal inAmerican Writers(1824–25) declaredThe SpyAmerica's most popular novel, but critiqued it as ""rather too full of stage-tricks and clap-traps. The disguises; the pathos; the love-parts; the heroines—are all contemptible.""[16]

Two operatic adaptations of the novel exist.La spia, overro, Il merciaiuolo americano, byAngelo Villanis[it]to a libretto byFelice Romani, premiered inTurinat the Teatro Sutera in 1849.[17][18]The other, byLuigi Arditito a libretto by Filippo Manetta, premiered inNew York Cityat theAcademy of Musicon March 24, 1856.[19][20]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225,The Satyricon — Complete,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyricon,"The work is narrated by its central figure, Encolpius. The surviving sections of the novel begin with Encolpius traveling with a companion and former lover named Ascyltos, who has joined Encolpius on numerous escapades. Encolpius' slave, Giton, is at his owner's lodging when the story begins.

In the first passage preserved, Encolpius is in a Greek town inCampania, perhapsPuteoli, where he is standing outside a school, railing against theAsiatic styleand false taste in literature, which he blames on the prevailing system of declamatory education (1–2). His adversary in this debate is Agamemnon, asophist, who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents (3–5). Encolpius discovers that his companion Ascyltos has left and breaks away from Agamemnon when a group of students arrive (6).

Encolpius then gets lost and asks an old woman for help returning home. She takes him to a brothel which she refers to as his home. There, Encolpius locates Ascyltos (7–8) and then Giton (8), who claims that Ascyltos made a sexual attempt on him (9). After raising their voices against each other, the fight ends in laughter and the friends reconcile but still agree to split at a later date (9–10). Later, Encolpius tries to have sex with Giton, but is interrupted by Ascyltos, who assaults him after catching the two in bed (11). The three go to the market, where they are involved in a convoluted dispute over stolen property (12–15). Returning to their lodgings, they are confronted byQuartilla, a devotee ofPriapus, who condemns their attempts to pry into the cult's secrets (16–18).

The companions are overpowered by Quartilla, her maids, and an agedcinaedus, who sexually torture them (19–21), then provide them with dinner and engage them in further sexual activity (21–26). An orgy ensues and the sequence ends with Encolpius and Quartilla exchanging kisses while they spy through a keyhole at the mock-wedding between Giton and Pennychis, a seven-year-old virgin girl (26).

This section of the Satyricon, regarded by classicists such as Conte and Rankin as emblematic ofMenippean satire, takes place a day or two after the beginning of the extant story. Encolpius and companions are invited by one of Agamemnon's slaves to a dinner at the estate ofTrimalchio, afreedmanof enormous wealth, who entertains his guests with ostentatious and grotesque extravagance. After preliminaries in the baths and halls (26–30), the guests (mostly freedmen) enter the dining room, where their host joins them.

Extravagant courses are served while Trimalchio flaunts his wealth and his pretence of learning (31–41). Trimalchio's departure to the toilet (he is incontinent) allows space for conversation among the guests (41–46). Encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbors, about the weather, about the hard times, about the public games, and about the education of their children. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious wealthy of his age.[citation needed][according to whom?]

After Trimalchio's return from the lavatory (47), the succession of courses is resumed, some of them disguised as other kinds of food or arranged to resemble certainzodiacsigns (35). Falling into an argument with Agamemnon (a guest who secretly holds Trimalchio in disdain), Trimalchio reveals that he once saw theSibyl of Cumae, who because of her great age was suspended in a flask for eternity (48).

Supernatural stories about awerewolf(62) and witches are told (63). Following a lull in the conversation, a stonemason namedHabinnasarrives with his wife Scintilla (65), who compares jewellery with Trimalchio's wife Fortunata (67). Then Trimalchio sets forth his will and gives Habinnas instructions on how to build his monument when he is dead (71).

Encolpius and his companions, by now wearied and disgusted, try to leave as the other guests proceed to the baths, but are prevented by a porter (72). They escape only after Trimalchio holds a mock funeral for himself. Thevigiles, mistaking the sound of horns for a signal that a fire has broken out, burst into the residence (78). Using this sudden alarm as an excuse to get rid of the sophist Agamemnon, whose company Encolpius and his friends are weary of, they flee as if from a real fire (78).

Encolpius returns with his companions to the inn but, having drunk too much wine, passes out while Ascyltos takes advantage of the situation and seduces Giton (79). On the next day, Encolpius wakes to find his lover and Ascyltos in bed together naked. Encolpius quarrels with Ascyltos and the two agree to part, but Encolpius is shocked when Giton decides to stay with Ascyltos (80). After two or three days spent in separate lodgings sulking and brooding on his revenge, Encolpius sets out with sword in hand, but is disarmed by a soldier he encounters in the street (81–82).

After entering a picture gallery, he meets with an old poet, Eumolpus. The two exchange complaints about their misfortunes (83–84), and Eumolpus tells how, when he pursued an affair with a boy inPergamonwhile employed as his tutor, the youth wore him out with his own high libido (85–87). After talking about the decay of art and the inferiority of the painters and writers of the age to the old masters (88), Eumolpus illustrates a picture of the capture ofTroy,Troiae Halosis. by some verses on that theme (89).

This ends when those who are walking in the adjoining colonnade drive Eumolpus out with stones (90). Encolpius invites Eumolpus to dinner. As he returns home, Encolpius encounters Giton, who begs him to take him back as his lover. Encolpius finally forgives him (91). Eumolpus arrives from the baths and reveals that a man there (evidently Ascyltos) was looking for someone called Giton (92).

Encolpius decides not to reveal Giton's identity, but he and the poet fall into rivalry over the boy (93–94). This leads to a fight between Eumolpus and the other residents of theinsula(95–96), which is broken up by the manager Bargates. Then Ascyltos arrives with a municipal slave to search for Giton, who hides under a bed at Encolpius's request (97). Eumolpus threatens to reveal him but after much negotiation ends up reconciled to Encolpius and Giton (98).

In the next scene preserved, Encolpius and his friends board a ship, along with Eumolpus's hired servant, later named as Corax (99). Encolpius belatedly discovers that the captain is an old enemy, Lichas ofTarentum. Also on board is a woman called Tryphaena, by whom Giton does not want to be discovered (100–101). Despite their attempt to disguise themselves as Eumolpus's slaves (103), Encolpius and Giton are identified (105).

Eumolpus speaks in their defence (107), but it is only after fighting breaks out (108) that peace is agreed (109). To maintain good feelings, Eumolpus tells the story of a widow ofEphesus. At first she planned to starve herself to death in her husband's tomb, but she was seduced by a soldier guardingcrucifiedcorpses, and when one of these was stolen she offered the corpse of her husband as a replacement (110–112).

The ship is wrecked in a storm (114). Encolpius, Giton, and Eumolpus get to shore safely (as apparently does Corax), but Lichas is washed ashore drowned (115). The companions learn they are in the neighbourhood ofCrotona, and that the inhabitants are notorious legacy-hunters (116). Eumolpus proposes taking advantage of this, and it is agreed that he will pose as a childless, sickly man of wealth, and the others as his slaves (117).

As they travel to the city, Eumolpus lectures on the need for elevated content in poetry (118), which he illustrates with a poem of almost 300 lines on theCivil WarbetweenJulius CaesarandPompey(119–124). When they arrive in Crotona, the legacy-hunters prove hospitable.

When the text resumes, the companions have apparently been in Crotona for some time (125). A maid named Chrysis flirts with Encolpius and brings to him her beautiful mistress Circe, who asks him for sex. However, his attempts are prevented by impotence (126–128). Circe and Encolpius exchange letters, and he seeks a cure by sleeping without Giton (129–130). When he next meets Circe, she brings with her an elderly enchantress called Proselenos who attempts amagicalcure (131). Nonetheless, he fails again to make love, as Circe has Chrysis and him flogged (132).

Encolpius is tempted to sever the offending organ, but prays toPriapusat his temple for healing (133). Proselenos and the priestess Oenothea arrive. Oenothea, who is also a sorceress, claims she can provide the cure desired by Encolpius and begins cooking (134–135). While the women are temporarily absent, Encolpius is attacked by the temple's sacred geese and kills one of them. Oenothea is horrified, but Encolpius pacifies her with an offer of money (136–137).

Oenothea tears open the breast of the goose, and uses its liver to foretell Encolpius's future (137). That accomplished, the priestess reveals a ""leather dildo"" (scorteum fascinum), and the women apply various irritants to him, which they use to prepare Encolpius for anal penetration (138). Encolpius flees from Oenothea and her assistants. In the following chapters, Chrysis herself falls in love with Encolpius (138–139).

An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela places her son and daughter with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. After fondling the son, Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth he claims to have has not appeared, the patience of the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).

Although interrupted by frequent gaps, 141 sections of consecutive narrative have been preserved. These can be compiled into the length of a longer novella. The extant portions were supposedly ""from the 15th and 16th books"" from a notation on a manuscript found inTrauinDalmatiain 1663 by Petit. However, according to translator and classicistWilliam Arrowsmith,

Still, speculation as to the size of the original puts it somewhere on the order of a work of thousands of pages, and comparisons for length range fromTom JonestoIn Search of Lost Time. The extant text runs to 140 pages in the Arrowsmith edition. The complete novel must have been considerably longer, but its true length cannot be known.

Statements in the extant narrative allow the reconstruction of some events that must have taken place earlier in the work. Encolpius and Giton have had contact with Lichas and Tryphaena. Both seem to have been lovers of Tryphaena (113) at a cost to her reputation (106). Lichas' identification of Encolpius by examining his groin (105) implies that they have also had sexual relations. Lichas' wife has been seduced (106) and his ship robbed (113).

Encolpius states at one point,

To many scholars, that suggests Encolpius had been condemned for a crime of murder, or more likely he simply feared being sentenced, to fight to his death in the arena. The statement probably is linked to an earlier insult by Ascyltos (9), who called Encolpius a ""gladiator"". One scholar speculates that Encolpius had been an actualgladiatorrather than a criminal, but there is no clear evidence in the surviving text for that interpretation.[6](pp 47–48)

A number of fragments of Petronius's work are preserved in other authors.Serviuscites Petronius as his source for a custom atMassiliaof allowing a poor man, during times of plague, to volunteer to serve as ascapegoat, receiving support for a year at public expense and then being expelled.[7]Sidonius Apollinarisrefers to ""Arbiter"", by which he apparently means Petronius's narrator Encolpius, as a worshipper of the ""sacred stake"" ofPriapusin the gardens of Massilia.[8]It has been proposed that Encolpius's wanderings began after he offered himself as the scapegoat and was ritually expelled.[6](pp 44–45)Other fragments may relate to a trial scene.[9][10]

Among the poems ascribed to Petronius is anoraclepredicting travels to theDanubeand toEgypt. Courtney[6]notes that the prominence of Egypt in the ancient Greek novels might make it plausible for Petronius to have set an episode there, but expresses some doubt about the oracle's relevance to Encolpius's travels,

The date of theSatyriconwas controversial in 19th- and 20th-century scholarship, with dates proposed as varied as the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD.[11]A consensus on this issue now exists. A date underNero(1st century AD) is indicated by the work's social background[12]and in particular by references to named popular entertainers.[13][14]

Evidence in the author's style and literary concerns also indicate that this was the period during which he was writing. Except where theSatyriconimitates colloquial language, as in the speeches of the freedmen at Trimalchio's dinner, its style corresponds with the literary prose ofthe period. Eumolpus' poem on the Civil War and the remarks with which he prefaces it (118–124) are generally understood as a response to thePharsaliaof the Neronian poetLucan.[14][15]

Similarly, Eumolpus's poem on thecapture of Troy(89) has been related to Nero'sTroicaand to the tragedies ofSeneca the Younger,[16]and parody of Seneca'sEpistleshas been detected in the moralizing remarks of characters in theSatyricon.[17]There is disagreement about the value of some individual arguments but, according to S. J. Harrison, ""almost all scholars now support a Neronian date"" for the work.[11]

The manuscripts of theSatyriconascribe the work to a ""Petronius Arbiter"", while a number of ancient authors (Macrobius,Sidonius Apollinaris,Marius Victorinus,DiomedesandJerome) refer to the author as ""Arbiter"". The name Arbiter is likely derived from Tacitus' reference to a courtier namedPetroniusas Nero'sarbiter elegantiaeor fashion adviser (Annals16.18.2). That the author is the same as this courtier is disputed. Many modern scholars accept the identification, pointing to a perceived similarity of character between the two and to possible references to affairs at the Neronian court.[18]Other scholars consider this identification ""beyond conclusive proof"".[19]

TheSatyriconis considered one of the gems of Western literature, and, according to Branham, it is the earliest of its kind in Latin.[20]Petronius mixes together two antithetical genres: thecynicandparodicmenippean satire, and theidealizingandsentimentalGreekromance.[20]The mixing of these two radically contrasting genres generates the sophisticated humor and ironic tone ofSatyricon.[20]

The name “satyricon” implies that the work belongs to the type to whichVarro, imitating the GreekMenippus, had given the character of a medley of prose and verse composition. But the string of fictitious narrative by which the medley is held together is something quite new in Roman literature. The author was happily inspired in his devices for amusing himself and thereby transmitted to modern times a text based on the ordinary experience of contemporary life; the precursor of such novels asGil BlasbyAlain-René LesageandThe Adventures of Roderick RandombyTobias Smollett. It reminds the well-read protagonist ofJoris-Karl Huysmans'sÀ reboursof certain nineteenth-century French novels: ""In its highly polished style, its astute observation, its solid structure, he could discern curious parallels and strange analogies with the handful of modern French novels he was able to tolerate.""[21]"

A young captain of the guard admires the beautiful princess Salome, Herod's stepdaughter. A page warns the captain that something terrible may happen if he continues to stare at the princess. Salome is fascinated by Jokanaan's voice. She persuades the captain to open the cistern so that the prophet can emerge, and she can see him and touch him.[22]Jokanaan appears, denouncing Herodias and her husband. At first frightened by the sight of the holy man, Salome becomes fascinated by him, begging him to let her touch his hair, his skin and kiss his mouth. When she tells him she is Herodias's daughter, he calls her a ""daughter of Sodom"" and bids her keep away from him. All Salome's attempts to attract him fail, and he swears she will never kiss his mouth, cursing her as the daughter of an adulteress and advising her to seek the Lord. He returns to his underground confinement. The young captain of the guard, unable to bear Salome's desire for another man, fatally stabs himself.[23]

Herod appears from the palace, looking for the princess and commenting on the strange look of the moon. When he slips in the captain's blood, he suddenly panics. Herodias dismisses his fears and asks him to go back inside with her, but Herod's attention has turned libidinously towards Salome, who rejects his advances. From the cistern, Jokanaan resumes his denunciation of Herodias; she demands that Herod hand the prophet over to the Jews. Herod refuses, maintaining that Jokanaan is a holy man and has seen God. His words spark an argument among the Jews concerning the true nature of God, and two Nazarenes talk about the miracles of Jesus. As Jokanaan continues to accuse her, Herodias demands that he is silenced.[24]

Herod asks Salome to dance for him. She refuses, but when he promises to give her anything she wants, she agrees. Ignoring her mother's pleas – ""Ne dansez pas, ma fille"" – ""Do not dance, my daughter"" – Salome performs thedance of the seven veils.[n 8]Delighted, Herod asks what reward she would like, and she asks for the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter. Horrified, Herod refuses, while Herodias rejoices at Salome's choice. Herod offers other rewards, but Salome insists and reminds Herod of his promise. He finally yields. The executioner descends into the cistern, and Salome impatiently awaits her reward. When the prophet's head is brought to her, she passionately addresses Jokanaan as if he were still alive and finally kisses his lips:

Herod, frightened and appalled at Salome's behaviour, orders the soldiers, ""Tuez cette femme!"" – ""Kill that woman!"", and they crush her to death under their shields.[27]

In 1901, within a year of Wilde's death,Salomewas produced in Berlin byMax ReinhardtinHedwig Lachmann's German translation,[28]and ran, according toRobbie Ross, for ""a longer consecutive period in Germany than any play by any Englishman, not excepting Shakespeare"".[29]The play was not revived in Paris until 1973 (althoughRichard Strauss'soperatic versionwas frequently seen there from 1910 onwards).[30]Les Archives du spectaclerecord 13 productions of Wilde's play in France between 1973 and 2020.[30]

The American premiere was given in New York in 1905 by the Progressive Stage Society, an amateur group. A professional production was presented at theAstor Theatrethe following year, withMercedes Leighin the title role.[31]TheInternet Broadway Databaserecords five New York productions between 1917 and 2003.[32]The Salomes includedEvelyn Preer(1923),Sheryl Lee(1992) andMarisa Tomei(2003), and among the actors playing Herod wasAl Pacinoin 1992 and 2003.[32]

The play was given in Czech inBrnoin 1924, and in English at theGate Theatrein Dublin in 1928 (directed byHilton Edwards, withMicheál Mac Liammóiras Jokanaan).[33]In Tokyo in 1960Yukio Mishimadirected a Japanese version in a translation byKōnosuke Hinatsuwhich,The Timesreported, ""rendered Wilde's rhetoric into the measured cadences of fifteenth-century Japanese"".[34]A later Japanese production was seen in Tokyo and subsequently in France in 1996.[35]

In Britain, the Lord Chamberlain's consent to public performance still being withheld, the first production there was given in May 1905 in a private performance in London by the New Stage Club, in which the performance ofRobert Farquharsonas Herod was reportedly of remarkable power.[36]Millicent Murbyplayed Salome, andFlorence Farrdirected. A second private performance followed in 1906 by the Literary Theatre Society, with Farquharson again as Herod.[37]The costumes and scenery byCharles Rickettswere much admired, but the rest of the cast and the direction were poor, according to Ross.[38]A 1911 production at theCourt TheatrebyHarcourt Williams, withAdeline Bourneas Salome, received disparaging notices.[39]

The ban on public performance of Salome was not lifted until 1931. The last ""private"" production, earlier that year, featuring a dance of the seven veils choreographed byNinette de Valois, was judged ""creepily impressive"" byThe Daily Telegraph.[40]For the first sanctioned public production, at theSavoy Theatre, Farquharson reprised his Herod, with real-life mother and daughter casting,Nancy PriceandJoan Maudeas Herodias and Salome. The production was deemed tame and unthrilling, and the play – ""gone modest and middle class"" as one critic put it – was not seen again in the West End for more than twenty years.[41]

A 1954 London revival, a vehicle for the Australian actorFrank Thring, made little impact, and it was not untilLindsay Kemp's 1977 production at theRoundhousethatSalomewas established as a critical and box-office success, running for six months in repertory with Kemp's adaptation ofOur Lady of the Flowers.[42][43]That version was a free adaptation of the original, with an all-male cast, switching between French and English texts and using only about a third of Wilde's dialogue.[42]A 1988 production bySteven Berkoffin which he played Herod, was seen at the Gate Theatre, theEdinburgh Festivaland at theNational Theatre, London. It focused on Wilde's words, relying on the skills of the actors and the imagination of audiences to evoke the setting and action.[44]A 2017 production by theRoyal Shakespeare Company, described as ""gender fluid"", featured a male actor,Matthew Tennyson, as Salome.[45]

InLes Annales du théâtre et de la musique, Edouard Stoullig reported that press reviews had been generally benevolent out of protest at the harsh treatment received by Wilde in Britain. In Stoullig's view the play was a good piece of rhetoric marred by too many ""ridiculous repetitions"" of lines by minor characters.[12]InLe FigaroHenry Fouquiershared Stoullig's view that the piece owed something to Flaubert, and thought it ""an exercise in romantic literature, not badly done, a little boring"".[11]The reviewer inLe Tempssaid, ""M. Wilde has certainly read Flaubert, and cannot forget it. The most interesting thing aboutSalomeis the style. The work was written in French by M. Wilde. It is full of very elaborate and ornate verses. The colours, the stars, the birds, the rare gems, everything that adorns nature, has provided M. Wilde with points of comparison and ingenious themes for the stanzas andantistrophesthatSalome'scharacters utter"".[46]La Plumesaid, ""Saloméhas almost all the qualities of a poem, the prose is as musical and fluid as verse, full of images and metaphors"".[47]

When banning the original 1892 production ofSalome, the responsible official in the Lord Chamberlain's office commented privately, ""The piece is written in French – half Biblical, half pornographic – by Oscar Wilde himself. Imagine the average British public's reception of it"".[48]In Britain the critics in general either ignored or disparaged the play.The Timesdescribed it as ""an arrangement in blood and ferocity, morbid, bizarre, repulsive, and very offensive in its adaptation of scriptural phraseology to situations the reverse of sacred"".[49]The Pall Mall Gazettesuggested that the play was far from original: ""the reader ofSalomeseems to stand in the Island of Voices, and to hear around him and about the utterances of friends, the whisperings of demigods"" – particularlyGautier, Maeterlinck and above all Flaubert – ""There is no freshness in Mr Wilde's ideas; there is no freshness in his method of presenting those ideas"".[50]New York reviewers were not impressed when the play was first professionally produced there in 1906:The Suncalled it ""bloodily degenerate"";The New-York Tribunethought it ""decadent stuff, not worthy of notice"".[31]

Raby comments that later criticism of the play ""has tended to treat it either as a literary text or as a theatrical aberration"".[51]The historian John Stokes writes thatSalomeis a rare instance in British theatrical history of an authenticallySymbolistdrama. Symbolist authors rejected naturalism and used ""poetic language and pictorial settings to invoke the inner lives of characters"", expressing without the constraints of naturalism all kinds of emotions ""both spiritual and sensual"".[52]"

The novel has been adapted to film, television, and radio:

In 1985 BBC released a12-part 350-minute miniseriesstarringNigel Stock,Alan Parnaby,Clive SwiftandPatrick Malahide.[17]

In 1977,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Barry Campbell andConstance CoxwithFreddie Jonesas Mr. Pickwick.[18]In 1997,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Martyn Read withClive Francisas Mr. Pickwick.[19]

There was an early attempt at a theatrical adaptation with songs byW. T. Moncrieffand entitledSamuel Weller, or, The Pickwickians, in 1837. This was followed in 1871 byJohn Hollingshead's stage playBardell versus Pickwick. The first successful musical wasPickwick(sometimesPickwick, A Dramatic Cantata) bySir Francis BurnandandEdward Solomonand premiered at the Comedy Theatre on 7 February 1889.[20]

PickwickbyCyril Ornadel,Wolf Mankowitz, andLeslie Bricussewas a musical version which premiered inManchesterin 1963 before transferring to theWest End. It originally starredHarry Secombe(later cast as ""Mr. Bumble"" in the film version ofOliver!) in the title role andRoy Castleas ""Sam Weller"". Although it was a major success in London, running for 694 performances,Pickwickfailed in the United States when it opened onBroadwayin 1965. In 1969, theBBCfilmed the musical as the TV moviePickwickwith Secombe and Castle reprising their stage roles. Both the stage and TV versions featured the songIf I Ruled the World, which became a hit for Secombe and other singers such asTony BennettandSammy Davis Jr.

Part ofThe Pickwick Paperswere featured inCharles Dickens' Ghost Stories, a 60-minute animation made by Emerald City Films (1987). These includedThe Ghost in the Wardrobe,The Mail Coach Ghosts, andThe Goblin and the Gravedigger.

Stephen Jarvis's novelDeath and Mr Pickwick[21](2014) is in part a literary thriller, examining in forensic detail the question of whether the idea, character and physiognomy of Samuel Pickwick originated with Dickens, or with the original illustrator and instigator of the project, Robert Seymour. The conclusion of the narrator is that the accepted version of events given by Dickens and the publisherEdward Chapmanis untrue.

The novel was published in 19 issues over 20 months; the last was double-length and cost twoshillings. In mourning for his sister-in-lawMary Hogarth, Dickens missed a deadline and consequently, there was no number issued in May 1837. Numbers were typically issued on the last day of its given month:

Dickens drew on places that he knew from his childhood. He located the duel between Mr. Winkle and Dr. Slammer atFort Pitt, Chatham,[22]close to Ordnance Terrace where he had lived as a boy between 1817 and 1821.[23]

The popularity ofThe Pickwick Papersspawned many imitations and sequels in print, as well as actual clubs and societies inspired by the club in the novel. One example still in operation is the Pickwick Bicycle Club of London, established in 1870, the year of Charles Dickens's death.[24]The Dickens Pickwick Club was founded in 1976 byCedric Dickens, the author's great-grandson. Other clubs, groups, and societies operating under the name ""The Pickwick Club"" have existed since the original publication of the story.

In 1837, Dickens wrote to William Howison about the Edinburgh Pickwick Club. Dickens approved of the use of the name and the celebration of the characters and spirit of the novel. He wrote:

Other clubs include one meeting as early as December 1836 in the East of London and another meeting at the Sun Tavern inLong Acrein London. Dickens wrote to the secretary of the latter club in 1838 about attending a meeting:

In many Pickwick Clubs, members can take on the names of the characters in the novel. The website for the Pickwick Bicycle Club states: ""Our rules state that 'Each Member shall adopt the sobriquet allocated by the Management Committee, being the name of some male character in the Pickwick Papers, and be addressed as such at all meetings of the Club'.""[27]

A French translation byEugénie Niboyetappeared in 1838 in a two-volume edition. It was entitledLe Club des Pickwistes, roman comique. Later French translations have used titles such asAventures de Monsieur Pickwick.

Benito Pérez GaldóspublishedAventuras de Pickwick, a Spanish translation of thePickwick Papers, in 1868. Although Pérez Galdós was not born until after the publication of Dickens' first novel, he is sometimes described as the Spanish equivalent of Dickens.[28]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47,Anne of Avonlea,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Avonlea,"Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School.  The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbour, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora.  They are the children of Marilla Cuthbert's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country.  Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Davy is Dora's exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly, of course) to know the twins will remain with them.

Other characters introduced are some of Anne's new pupils, such as Paul Irving, an American boy living with his grandmother in Avonlea while his widower father works in the States.  He delights Anne with his imagination and whimsical ways, which are reminiscent of Anne's in her childhood. Later in the book, Anne and her friends meet Miss Lavendar Lewis, a sweet but lonely lady in her 40s who had been engaged to Paul's father 25 years before, but parted from him after a disagreement.  At the end of the book, Mr. Irving returns and he and Miss Lavendar marry.

In the chapter entitled, ""An Adventure on the Tory Road,"" Anne and Diana discuss the eponymous "" 'Tory' Road,"" constructed and landscaped by "" 'the Tory government',"" provincial ""Conservatives...'when they were in power just to show they were doing something.' "" A resident also reminisces about adolescent courtship in her father's roadside home ""twenty years ago.""[7]The Conservative majority dissolved amidst the 1867Land Questionpolitics of theTenant Leagueand regained the provincial government between1870-91.[8]1896 Dominion electionssimilarly inspired author L.M. Montgomery to fictionalize ""Conservative"" reactions to Liberal ""Grit"" ascension in the 1917Anne's House of Dreams. Both novels traverse multiple temporalities and timelines in a politics of post-Confederation memory.

Anne discovers the delights and troubles of being a teacher, takes part in the raising of Davy and Dora, and organizes the A.V.I.S. (Avonlea Village Improvement Society) together with Gilbert, Diana, and Fred Wright, though their efforts to improve the town are not always successful.  The Society takes up a subscription to repaint an old town hall, only to have the painter provide the wrong colour of paint, turning the hall into a bright blue eyesore. The trials and travails of the A.V.I.S. further represented the lackluster results of an imagined bipartisan effort to interweave ""Liberal"" notions of rural ""secularization"" with  ""Conservative"" temporal ideas on urban ""modernities.""

Towards the end of the book, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's husband dies and Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla at Green Gables, allowing Anne to go to college at last.  She and Gilbert make plans to attend Redmond College in the Autumn.

This book sees Anne maturing slightly, even though she still cannot avoid getting into a number of her familiar scrapes, including selling Mr. Harrison's cow after mistaking it for her own, accidentally rubbing red dye on her nose before meeting a famous author, and getting stuck in a duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window.

Anne Shirley- Once an impetuous and awkward orphan, Anne has matured and now serves as the teacher of the Avonlea school. She is described as being slim and lithe, having starry grey eyes and hair that charitable friends describe as auburn. She still has not lost her imaginative, creative spirit and charms nearly everyone she meets.

Marilla Cuthbert- The woman who took Anne in five years before, along with her late brother Matthew. To the outsider, she may still seem austere, but Marilla has become more emotionally demonstrative and, what was once described as the ""glimmerings"" has developed into a fuller sense of humour.

Gilbert Blythe- Anne's childhood enemy and now good friend. Gilbert is also a teacher at the nearby White Sands School. He is in love with Anne but does not yet admit it to her.

Diana Barry- Anne's bosom friend since childhood. Diana is described as having beautiful black hair and a rosy complexion. She is less imaginative than Anne, but remains a completely loyal friend.

Rachel Lynde- Marilla's best friend and neighbour, an outspoken and opinionated, but well-intentioned woman.  Though she still argues with Anne, she is genuinely fond of her.

Davy Keith- One of the twins whom Marilla takes in. Davy is mischievous, naughty, loves to eat sweets and rarely does what he is told. He has blonde hair in ringlets all over his head, one dimple, roguish hazel eyes, a snub nose and is often smiling.

Dora Keith- Dora, Davy's sister, is his opposite. She does everything she is told without mistake and is very docile. She has fair, long, sleek curls, mild hazel eyes, a straight nose and ""prunes and prisms"" mouth.

Jane Andrews- Anne's childhood friend, also a teacher at the Newbridge School.

Fred Wright- A friend of Gilbert's, who plans to follow in his father's footsteps as a farmer. Fred and Diana become engaged, although he falls short of Anne's romantic vision of a dashing dream husband.

Mr. J.A. Harrison- Anne and Marilla's bad-tempered new neighbour. Anne wins him over and they become good friends. He has a  grounded, practical attitude and blunt, sometimes hurtful, manners. He inherited a foul-mouthed parrot named Ginger who comes between Mr. Harrison and those he holds dearest even, at times, Anne, who it persists in referring to as a ""red-headed snippet.""

Paul Irving- One of Anne's students, an imaginative young boy and a fast friend for Anne. He was raised in the United States and has come to Avonlea to live with his paternal grandmother.

Anthony Pye- another of Anne's students, and initially her most difficult. He tests Anne's patience, by releasing a mouse in class, to the point that she finally snaps and gives him a whipping. Although she is horrified at herself afterwards, she does win his respect, and his behaviour improves.

Miss Lavendar Lewis- An imaginative, attractive, old maid with snow white hair who Anne and Diana come across on their way to a friend's place. She lives in Echo Lodge. She also becomes good friends with Anne.

Charlotta the Fourth- Miss Lavendar's maid. Her real name is Leonora and she is the youngest of four girls who have all been employed by Miss Lavendar. Her eldest sister was named Charlotta and Miss Lavendar kept referring to Charlotta's three sisters as ""Charlotta"" as well. Charlotta is well-meaning, but a bit awkward, and addresses everyone as either ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"".

Stephen Irving- Paul's father and Miss Lavendar's sweetheart from her youth. The two had an argument before Paul was born and Mr. Irving left for the States and married Paul's mother. They are once again reconciled by Anne many years after Mr. Irving's first wife's death.

Priscilla Grant- An old classmate of Anne's from Queens Academy.

Montgomery continued the story of Anne Shirley in a series of sequels. They are listed in the order of Anne's age in each novel.

The 1975 miniseriesAnne of Avonlea, a sequel to the lost 1972 miniseriesAnne of Green Gablesstarring Kim Braden as Anne, is based on this novel as well as the following book,Anne of the Island.

The book formed the basis for the 1987CBC TelevisionminiseriesAnne of Green Gables: The Sequel, which aired asAnne of Avonleaon the Disney Channel in the United States, as the sequel to the 1985 filmAnne of Green Gables.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/289,The Wind in the Willows,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows,"With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, ""Hang spring cleaning!"" He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with ""Ratty"" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had ""read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends"".[12]

InThe Enchanted Places,Christopher Robin Milnewrote ofThe Wind in the Willows:

The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story. Dramatisations include:

Abridged readings:

Other presentation formats:

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that ""Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...""[34]

However, after being frightened when the log cries out, he gives it to his neighborGeppettowho wants to carve a puppet from it and make a living as a traveling puppeteer. He carves a boy and names him ""Pinocchio"". Once the puppet is finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and into the town, where he is caught by aCarabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto.

Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat, where atalking cricketwarns him of the perils of disobedience and laziness. After being called a wooden head, in retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, accidentally killing it. Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but a chick hatches from the egg and leaves to find food. He knocks on a neighbor's door, but they fear he is pulling a prank and dump water on him. Cold and wet, Pinocchio goes home and lies down on a stove, and upon waking he finds his feet have burned off. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison, gives Pinocchio three pears to eat for breakfast, and makes him a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school and Geppetto makes him a suit of clothing consisting of a dress made of flowered paper, tree bark shoes, and a cap made of dough, and sells his only coat to buy him a spelling book.

On his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre and sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppetsHarlequin,Pulcinellaand Signora Rosaura call out to Pinocchio. This angers the puppet masterMangiafuoco, and he decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner. However, after Pinocchio pleads for his and Harlequin's salvation and he learns of Geppetto's poverty, Mangiafuoco releases him and gives him five gold pieces.

On his way home, Pinocchio meetsa fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame; a whiteblackbirdtries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the Cat eats it. The two convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city ofCatchfools, they will grow into a tree with gold coins. They stop for dinner at the Red Lobster Inn where they trick Pinocchio into paying for their meals and flee after telling the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio they would meet him at the Field of Miracles in the morning.

As Pinocchio sets off for the city of Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears and tells him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again and as he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised asbandits, ambush and attempts to rob him but fails. After biting off the Cat's paw, he escapes to a white house, where he is greeted by a youngfairy with turquoise hairwho says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the Fox and the Cat catch Pinocchio and hang him in a tree and leave after getting tired of waiting for him to suffocate, leaving Pinocchio to die alone and think about his misbehavior.

The Fairy has Pinocchio rescued and calls in three doctors to evaluate him - the Owl says he is alive, the Crow says he is dead, and the Ghost of the Talking Cricket says he is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy offers medicine to Pinocchio, which he takes when several Undertakerrabbitsappear to collect his body. Now recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what happened to the gold coins and his nose grows. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio's lies are causing his nose to grow and calls in a flock ofwoodpeckersto chisel it down to size. She then sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage.

As Pinocchio heads out to find Geppetto, he once again meets the Fox and the Cat, who remind him of the Field of Miracles, and he agrees to go with them and plant his gold. Once there, Pinocchio buries his coins and leaves to wait twenty minutes for it to grow, only for the Fox and the Cat dig up the coins and run away.

Once Pinocchio returns, aparrotmocks him for falling for the Fox and Cat's tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse, where he reports the theft of the coins to agorillajudge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the gorilla judge sentences him to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness. Fortunately, all criminals are released early when the Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies.

As Pinocchio heads back to the forest, he finds an enormoussnakewith a smoking tail blocking the way. He asks the serpent to move, but it remains completely still, and he assumes it is dead. He begins to step over it, but it suddenly rises up and hisses at him, toppling him over onto his head. Struck by Pinocchio's fright and comical position, the snake laughs so hard hebursts an arteryand dies.

Pinocchio then heads back to the Fairy's house in the forest, where he sneaks into a farmer's yard to steal some grapes. He is caught in a weasel trap and encounters aglowworm, where the farmer finds him and ties him up in his doghouse. When Pinocchio foils the chicken-stealingweasels, the farmer frees him as a reward. Pinocchio finally returns to the cottage, but there he finds nothing but a gravestone and believes the Fairy has died.

A friendlypigeonsees Pinocchio mourning the Fairy's death and offers to give him a ride to the seashore, where Geppetto is building a boat to search for Pinocchio. Pinocchio is washed ashore when he tries to swim to his father, who is swallowed byThe Terrible Dogfish. Pinocchio accepts a ride from adolphinto the Island of Busy Bees where everyone works every day. Upon arriving there, Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water, and upon arriving at her house, he recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now old enough to be his mother. She says she will act as his mother, and he will begin going to school. She hints that if he does well in school and is good for one year, then he will become a real boy.

Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, making the other boys jealous. They trick Pinocchio into playing hooky by saying they saw a largesea monsterat the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, they were lying, and a fight breaks out, during which Pinocchio is accused of injuring another boy. He escapes, and along the way saves a drowningMastiffnamed Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio fromThe Green Fisherman, who was going to eat him. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, she gives him another chance.

Pinocchio does excellently in school, and the Fairy promises that he will be a real boy the next day, saying he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked after meetingCandlewick, one of his closest friends, who tells him he is heading to a place calledToyland, where children play all day and never work or study. Pinocchio goes along with him, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.

One morning, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. Amarmottells Pinocchio that he has gotten donkey fever, as boys who play and never study or work turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed, and Pinocchio is sold to a circus where he is trained to do tricks, until he falls and sprains his leg after seeing the Fairy in one of the box seats. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and use his hide to make a drum, and throws him into the sea to drown him. But when he goes to retrieve the corpse, he finds Pinocchio, who explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again. Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea, where the Terrible Dogfish appears and swallows him. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, and they escape with help from a largetunaand look for a new place to live.

Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat, who are now impoverished and lame and blind respectively. They plead for food and money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that they have earned their misfortune. Geppetto and Pinocchio then arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for a farmer, and recognizes his dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.

After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money, and gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all of his money. That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy, with his puppet body lying lifeless on a chair. The Fairy has also left him a new suit, boots, and a bag which contains 40 gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health.

The Adventures of Pinocchioincorporates elements similar to that offairy tales, as it is a story about an animated puppet and boys who turn into donkeys. The story is set in theTuscanarea of Italy, and featuresItalian languagepeppered withFlorentine dialectfeatures, such as theprotagonist's Florentine name.

As a young man, Collodi joined the seminary. However, the cause ofItalian unification(Risorgimento) usurped his calling, as he took to journalism as a means of supporting the Risorgimento in its struggle with theAustrian Empire.[7]In the 1850s, Collodi began to have a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books published. Once, he translated some French fairy-tales so well that he was asked whether he would like to write some of his own. In 1848, Collodi started publishingIl Lampione, a newspaper ofpolitical satire. With the founding of theKingdom of Italyin 1861, Collodi ceased his journalistic and militaristic activities and began writing children's books.[7]

Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recently unified Italy, includingViaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino(""Little Johnny's voyage through Italy""; 1876), a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, andMinuzzolo(1878).[8]In 1881, he sent a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet to a friend who edited a newspaper in Rome, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this ""bit of foolishness"" in his children's section. The editor did, and the children loved it.[9]

The Adventures of Pinocchiowas originally published in serial form in theGiornale per i bambini, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. In the original, serialized version, Pinocchio dies a gruesome death: hanged for his innumerable faults, at the end of Chapter 15. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16–36, in whichthe Fairy with Turquoise Hairrescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy, when he acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story more suitable for children. In the second half of the book, the maternal figure of the Blue-haired Fairy is the dominant character, versus the paternal figure of Geppetto in the first part. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book with huge success.[1]

Children's literature was a new idea in Collodi's time, an innovation in the 19th century. Thus in content and style it was new and modern, opening the way to many writers of the following century.

The Adventures of Pinocchiois the world'sthird most translated book(240–260 languages),[3][4]and was the first work of Italian children's literature to achieve international fame.[10]The book has had great impact on world culture, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide. The title character is acultural iconand one of the most reimagined characters in children's literature.[11]The popularity of the story was bolstered by the powerful philosopher-criticBenedetto Croce, who greatly admired the tale and reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature.[2]

Carlo Collodi, who died in 1890, was respected during his lifetime as a talented writer and social commentator, and his fame continued to grow whenPinocchiowas first translated into English byMary Alice Murrayin 1892, whose translation was added to the widely readEveryman's Libraryin 1911. Other well regarded English translations include the 1926 translation byCarol Della Chiesa, and the 1986 bilingual edition byNicolas J. Perella. The first appearance of the book in the United States was in 1898, with publication of the first US edition in 1901, translated and illustrated by Walter S. Cramp andCharles Copeland.[1]From that time, the story was one of the most famous children's books in the United States and an important step for many illustrators.[1]

Together with those from the United Kingdom, the American editions contributed to the popularity of Pinocchio in countries more culturally distant from Italy, such as Iceland and Asian countries.[1]In 1905,Otto Julius Bierbaumpublished a new version of the book in Germany, entitledZapfelkerns Abenteuer(lit.The Adventures of Pine Nut), and the first French edition was published in 1902. Between 1911 and 1945, translations were made into all European languages and several languages of Asia, Africa and Oceania.[12][1]In 1936, Soviet writerAleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoypublished a reworked version of Pinocchio titledThe Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino(originally a character in thecommedia dell'arte), which became one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature.

The first stage adaptation was launched in 1899, written by Gattesco Gatteschi and Enrico Guidotti and directed by Luigi Rasi.[1]Also, Pinocchio was adopted as a pioneer of cinema: in 1911,Giulio Antamorofeatured him in a 45-minute hand-coloured silent film starring Polidor (an almost complete version of the film was restored in the 1990s).[1]In 1932,Noburō Ōfujidirected a Japanese movie with an experimental technique using animated puppets,[1]while in the 1930s in Italy, there was an attempt to produce a full-length animated cartoon film of thesame title. The 1940Walt Disney versionwas a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.

Before writingPinocchio, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recentlyunified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titledViaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino(""Little Johnny's voyage through Italy"").[8]ThroughoutPinocchio, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun.

The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folk-tales of peasants who venture out into the world but are naively unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations.[13]At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from theindustrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was theemigrationof much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries, often as far away as South and North America.

Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. According to Thomas J. Morrissey and Richard Wunderlich inDeath and Rebirth in Pinocchio(1983) ""such mythological events probably imitate the annual cycle of vegetative birth, death, and renascence, and they often serve as paradigms for the frequent symbolic deaths and rebirths encountered in literature. Two such symbolic renderings are most prominent: re-emergence from a journey to hell and rebirth through metamorphosis.Journeys to the underworldare a common feature of Eurasian literary epics:Gilgamesh,Odysseus,Aeneas, andDanteall benefit from the knowledge and power they put on after such descents. Rebirth through metamorphosis, on the other hand, is a motif generally consigned to fantasy or speculative literature [...] These two figurative manifestations of the death-rebirth trope are rarely combined; however, Carlo Collodi's great fantasy-epic,The Adventures of Pinocchio, is a work in which a hero experiences symbolic death and rebirth through both infernal descent and metamorphosis. Pinocchio is truly a fantasy hero of epic proportions [...] Beneath the book's comic-fantasy texture—but not far beneath—lies a symbolic journey to the underworld, from which Pinocchio emerges whole.""[14]

The main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study. And in the end Pinocchio's willingness to provide for his father and devote himself to these things transforms him into a real boy with modern comforts. ""as a hero of what is, in the classic sense, a comedy,Pinocchiois protected from ultimate catastrophe, although he suffers quite a few moderate calamities. Collodi never lets the reader forget that disaster is always a possibility; in fact, that is just what Pinocchio's mentors —Geppetto, the Talking Cricket, and the Fairy— repeatedly tell him. Although they are part of a comedy, Pinocchio's adventures are not always funny. Indeed, they are sometimes sinister. The book's fictive world does not exclude injury, pain, or even death—they are stylized but not absent. [...] Accommodate them he does, by using the archetypal birth-death-rebirth motif as a means of structuring his hero's growth to responsible boyhood. Of course, the success of the puppet's growth is rendered in terms of his metamorphic rebirth as a flesh-and-blood human.""[14]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1515,The Merchant of Venice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice,"Bassanio, a youngVenetianof noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress of Belmont,Portia. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000ducatsto subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friendAntonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice, who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but has no liquid cash as  his ships and merchandise are busy at sea toTripolis,the Indies,MexicoandEngland– he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.

Antonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspokenantisemitismand because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates. Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio were unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take apoundof Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no ""usance"" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money in hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.

Meanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left awillstipulating that each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets, made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, ""Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire"",[1]as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Aragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, ""Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves"",[2]as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, ""Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath"".[3]The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that ""fancy"" (not true love) is ""It is engendered in the eye, / With gazing fed"";[4]Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.

At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.

At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for Venice, with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, atPadua.

The climax of the play is set in the court of theDuke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthazar, a young male ""doctor of the law"", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthazar, Portia in afamous speechrepeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy, advising him that mercy ""is twice blest: / It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.""[5]However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.

As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for ""specific performance"". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only theflesh, not the blood, of Antonio.(seequibble)Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his ""lands and goods"" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that ""if the scale do turn / But in the estimation of a hair, / Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.""[6]

Defeated, Shylock consents to accept Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond: first his offer to pay ""the bond thrice"", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal; but Portia also prevents him from doing this, on the ground that he has already refused it ""in the open court"". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an ""alien"", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half tothe governmentand half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke.  The Duke spares Shylock's life and says he may remit the forfeiture. Portia says the Duke may waive the state's share, but not Antonio's. Antonio says he is content that the state waive its claim to half Shylock's wealth if he can have his one-half share ""in use"" until Shylock's death, when the principal would be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. Antonio also asks that ""for this favour"" Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica. The Duke then threatens to recant his pardon of Shylock's life unless he accepts these conditions. Shylock, re-threatened with death, accepts with the words, ""I am content.""[7]

Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.

At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.

The forfeit of a merchant's deadlybondafter standing surety for a friend's loan was a common tale in England in the late 16th century.[8]In addition, the test of the suitors at Belmont, the merchant's rescue from the ""pound of flesh"" penalty by his friend's new wife disguised as a lawyer, and her demand for the betrothal ring in payment are all elements present in the 14th-century taleIl PecoronebyGiovanni Fiorentino, which was published in Milan in 1558.[9]Elements of the trial scene are also found inThe OratorbyAlexandre Sylvane, published in translation in 1596.[8]The story of the three caskets can be found inGesta Romanorum, a collection of tales probably compiled at the end of the 13th century.[10]

The date of composition ofThe Merchant of Veniceis believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned byFrancis Meresin 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed ""divers times"" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship theAndrew(I, i, 27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish shipSt. Andrew,captured by the English atCádizin 1596. A date of 1596–97 is considered consistent with the play's style.[citation needed]

The play was entered in theRegisterof theStationers Company, the method at that time of obtainingcopyrightfor a new play, byJames Robertson 22 July 1598 under the title ""the Marchaunt of Venyce or otherwise called the Jewe of Venyce.""[11]On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationerThomas Heyes; Heyes published the firstquartobefore the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-calledFalse Folio. (Later, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623First Folio, which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.[12]

The play is frequently staged, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appearantisemitic. Modern critics argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism. American literary criticHarold Bloomargued in 1998 that ""one would have to be blind, deaf and dumb not to recognise that Shakespeare's grand, equivocal comedyThe Merchant of Veniceis nevertheless a profoundly anti-semitic work"".[13]

English society in the Elizabethan and Jacobean era has been described as ""judeophobic"".[14]English Jewshad beenexpelledunderEdward Iin 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule ofOliver Cromwell. PoetJohn Donne, who was Dean ofSt Paul's Cathedraland a contemporary of Shakespeare, gave a sermon in 1624 perpetuating theBlood Libel– the entirely unsubstantiated antisemitic lie that Jews ritually murdered Christians to drink their blood and achieve salvation.[15]In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a yellow or red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto.[16]

Shakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition.[17]The title page of theQuartoindicates that the play was sometimes known asThe Jew of Venicein its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's early 1590s workThe Jew of Malta. One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the Old Testament vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religiousgraceto comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock'sforced conversionto Christianity to be a ""happy ending"" for the character, as, to some Christian audiences, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.[18][page range too broad]

Regardless of what Shakespeare'sauthorial intentmay have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. TheNazisused the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly afterKristallnachtin 1938,The Merchant of Venicewas broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed inLübeck(1938),Berlin(1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.[19][page needed]

In a series of articles calledObserver, first published in 1785, British playwrightRichard Cumberlandcreated a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, ""I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons ofAbraham, than theInquisitionitself.""[20]Cumberland later wrote a successful play,The Jew(1794), in which his title character,Sheva, is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.[21]

Thedepiction of Jews in literaturethroughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as ""a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard"".[22]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8578,The Grand Inquisitor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor,"The tale is told by Ivan with brief interruptive questions by Alyosha. In the tale,Christreturns to Earth inSevilleat the time of theInquisition. He performs a number of miracles (echoing miracles from theGospels). The people recognize Him and adore Him at theSeville Cathedral, but He is arrested by Inquisition leaders and sentenced to beburnt to deaththe next day. TheGrand Inquisitorvisits Him in His cell to tell Him that the Church no longer needs Him. The main portion of the text is devoted to the Inquisitor explaining to Jesus why His return would interfere with the mission of the Church.

The Inquisitor founds his denunciation of Jesus on the three questions thatSatanasked Jesus during thetemptation of Christin the desert. These three are the temptation to turn stones into bread, the temptation to cast Himself from the Temple and be saved by the angels, and the temptation to rule over all the kingdoms of the world. The Inquisitor states that Jesus rejected these three temptations in favor of freedom, but the Inquisitor thinks that Jesus has misjudged human nature. He does not believe that the vast majority of humanity can tolerate the freedom that Jesus has given to them. The Inquisitor thus implies that Jesus, in giving humans freedom to choose, has excluded the majority of humanity from redemption and doomed it to suffer.

Despite declaring the Inquisitor to be a nonbeliever, Ivan also has the Inquisitor saying that theCatholic Churchfollows ""the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction"" – meaning the Devil. He says: ""We are not with Thee, but with him, and that is our secret! For centuries have we abandoned Thee to follow him."" For the Inquisitor, it is the Devil who provided the tools to end human suffering and unite humanity under the banner of the Church. With the Church thus correctly organized, the multitude is guided by the few who are strong enough to take on the burden of freedom. The Inquisitor says that under him, all mankind will live and die happily in ignorance. Though he leads them only to ""death and destruction"", they will be happy along the way, for he and his representatives in the Church will relieve them of the terrible burden of freedom of conscience: ""The most agonizing secrets of their consciences – all, all will they bring to us, and we shall resolve it all, and they will attend our decision with joy, because it will deliver them from the great anxiety and fearsome torments of free and individual decision.""[2]

The Inquisitor advances this argument by explaining why Christ was wrong to reject each temptation by Satan. Christ should have turned stones into bread, as men will always follow those who will feed their bellies, and will also follow one who they see is capable of producing miracles. The Inquisitor recalls how Christ rejected this, saying ""man cannot live on bread alone"", and explains to Christ: ""Feed men, and then ask of them virtue! That's what they'll write on the banner they'll raise against Thee and with which they will destroy Thy temple."" Casting Himself down from the temple to be caught by angels would cement His godhood in the minds of people, who would follow Him forever. Ruling over all the kingdoms of the Earth would ensure their salvation, the Grand Inquisitor claims.

The segment ends when Christ, who has remained silent throughout, kisses the Inquisitor on his ""bloodless, aged lips"". The Inquisitor releases Christ but tells Him never to return. Christ, still silent, leaves into ""the dark alleys of the city"". Ivan concludes: ""The kiss burns in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea"".

After relating the tale, Ivan asks Alyosha if he ""renounces"" Ivan for his views. Alyosha responds by giving Ivan a soft kiss on the lips, to which the delighted Ivan replies: ""That's plagiarism… Thank you, though"". The brothers part soon afterward.

For Dostoevsky, the character of the Grand Inquisitor represents a prototypical expression of an ideology that denies Christ's true spiritual and historical significance and affirms its opposite. The Grand Inquisitor's anti-Christian philosophy is ironically accentuated by its appearance within an institutionally Christian context, but Dostoevsky identifies this same negation at the root of the socialist, nihilist and materialist doctrines of his contemporaries.[3]In a letter to his publisher, he writes that Ivan, through the Grand Inquisitor, openly ""declares himself in favour of what the Devil advocates"". The Grand Inquisitor speaks the same doctrine as Russian socialism, except that the socialists would never admit it openly. Ivan, however, is ""a sincere person who comes right out and admits that he agrees with the Inquisitor's view of humanity and that Christ's faith elevated man to a much higher level than where he actually stands."" For the socialists, according to Dostoevsky, Christ's law is ""burdensome and abstract, too heavy for weak people to bear—and instead of the law of Freedom and Enlightenment, they offer them the law of chains and enslavement through bread.""[4]Dostoevsky's notes contain passages that are more extreme than those eventually used. According toEdward Wasiolek, it is emphatically asserted in these notes that ""it is Christ who is guilty and cruel, and it is the Grand Inquisitor who is kind and innocent. It is Christ who demands that men suffer for Him, whereas the Grand Inquisitor suffers for men.""[5]

According toJoseph Frank, the prototype for the character of the Inquisitor can be found in Schiller'sDon Carlos: ""The play shares the same justification for the existence of evil in the world, the same answer to the problem of theodicy, that is at the heart of Dostoevsky's legend.""[6]

Dostoevsky's intention with ""The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor"" was to unmask the fundamental idea that lay behind the entire movement in Russia toward atheism, nihilism, rationalism and materialism, and away from the true Christian faith that was the spiritual heart of the nation.[7]Within the novel as a whole, this idea is expressed most rigorously and eloquently through the character of Ivan Fyodorovich: the 'poem' is Ivan's composition, and the ideas, dogmas, assertions, suggestions and equivocations expressed in the Inquisitor's monologue are the same ones at work within Ivan's tormented intellect and personal struggle for faith and identity. Though the poem's outward form is that of a monologue, a close analysis reveals its essentially dialogic nature, as an artistic representation of Ivan's idea in its encounters with other voices, both in the world and within himself. According toMikhail Bakhtin, detailed analysis of the Legend reveals"

The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son,ArchdeaconGrantly, will succeed him. Owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far moreEvangelicalBishop Proudie, gains thesee. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference, leading the Bishop to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel,The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital, is not well received, even though she seeks to have the position given to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, who has a wife and 14 children to support.

Even less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's new chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold. Slope hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship, in favour of Mr Harding. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the direction of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of theprebendaryDr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Stanhope has been in Italy recovering from a sore throat for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and their three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threaten the plans of Mr Slope. Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a disabled flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband, whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, servants and, indeed, Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame, and cannot keep away from the Signora. Dr Stanhope's artistic son Bertie is skilled at spending money and flitting from obsession to obsession (painting, Judaism, sculpting); his sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will help him settle down.

Summoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at theUniversity of Oxford, who nearly followed his mentorJohn Henry Newmaninto theRoman Catholic Church. A misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin, who think that she intends to marry Mr Slope, much to their disgust. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor, but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party held by the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by both Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of the misunderstanding, Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged.

The Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become the new Dean but Mr Harding is offered thepreferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and fifteen acres of garden. Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean. With the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to normal and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.

The literary scholarJohn Sutherlandobserves that Trollope suspended work on the novel (having reached the end of Chapter VIII) between February 1855 and May 1856, turning instead to his posthumously publishedThe New Zealander.During this time he changed his idea of writing a short novel (similar in length toThe Warden) to a longer one, and that from this hiatus there arise a number of inconsistencies in the text. In the first chapter Trollope says that Bishop Grantley is dying in ""the latter days of July"" and that Proudie became bishop ""just a month after his [Grantly's] demise"". At the beginning of Chapter IX, Sutherland observes that Trollope has Proudie three months onto his term as Bishop - effectively late November. However at the beginning of Chapter XII Slope is writing a letter dated 20 August, and in Chapters XXXIII and XXXV it is made clear that Miss Thorne'sfête champêtretakes place on the last day of September. In Chapter XLVIII Arabin proposes to Eleanor on ""a beautiful afternoon in the beginning of October"".

Sutherland points out that in the early chapters Trollope describes the Proudies as intending to spend as much time as possible in London, leaving the field clear for Slope to act on his own in Barchester with the action easily contained in a single-volume novel: in Chapter IV, Slope thinks to himself that, in the Proudies' anticipated absences in London, ""he, therefore, he, Mr Slope, would in effect be bishop of Barchester"". But when Trollope resumed the composition ofBarchester Towersin May 1856, planning the eventual three-volume novel as a result of the unexpectedly increasing sales ofThe Wardenin late 1855, he expanded the text by keeping the Proudies in Barchester and introducing a number of new characters who had not appeared in the earlier chapters - the Stanhopes, Mr Arabin, and the Thornes among others.

And although Sutherland notes that Trollope was ""often indifferent to minor inconsistencies in his narratives"", he regards these lapses as showing the point at which Trollope conceived the idea of the novel series which would eventually become the hugely successfulChronicles of Barsetshire.[3]

The Narrator begins by noting, ""For a long time, I went to bed early."" He comments on the way in which sleep seems to alter one's surroundings, and the way habit makes one indifferent to them. He remembers being in his room in the family's country home in Combray, while downstairs his parents entertain their friend Charles Swann, an elegant man of Jewish origin with strong ties to society. Due to Swann's visit, the Narrator is deprived of his mother's goodnight kiss, but he gets her to spend the night reading to him. This memory is the only one he has of Combray until years later the taste of amadeleinecake dipped in tea inspires a nostalgic incident ofinvoluntary memory. He remembers having a similar snack as a child with his invalid aunt Léonie, and it leads to more memories of Combray. He describes their servant Françoise, who is uneducated but possesses an earthy wisdom and a strong sense of both duty and tradition. He meets an elegant ""lady in pink"" while visiting his uncle Adolphe. He develops a love of the theater, especially the actress la Berma, and his awkward Jewish friend Bloch introduces him to the works of the writer Bergotte. He learns Swann made an unsuitable marriage but has social ambitions for his beautiful daughter Gilberte. Legrandin, a snobbish friend of the family, tries to avoid introducing the boy to his well-to-do sister. The Narrator describes two routes for country walks the child and his parents often enjoyed: the way past Swann's home (the Méséglise way), and the Guermantes way, both containing scenes of natural beauty. Taking the Méséglise way, he sees Gilberte Swann standing in her yard with a lady in white, Mme. Swann, and her supposed lover: Baron de Charlus, a friend of Swann's. Gilberte makes a gesture that the Narrator interprets as a rude dismissal. During another walk, he spies a lesbian scene involving Mlle. Vinteuil, daughter of a composer, and her friend. The Guermantes way is symbolic of the Guermantes family, the nobility of the area. The Narrator is awed by the magic of their name and is captivated when he first sees Mme. de Guermantes. He discovers how appearances conceal the true nature of things and tries writing a description of some nearby steeples. Lying in bed, he seems transported back to these places until he awakens.

Mme. Verdurin is an autocratic hostess who, aided by her husband, demands total obedience from the guests in her ""little clan"". One guest is Odette de Crécy, a formercourtesan, who has met Swann and invites him to the group. Swann is too refined for such company, but Odette gradually intrigues him with her unusual style. AsonatabyVinteuil, which features a ""little phrase"", becomes themotiffor their deepening relationship. The Verdurins host M. de Forcheville; their guests include Cottard, a doctor; Brichot, an academic; Saniette, the object of scorn; and a painter, M. Biche. Swann grows jealous of Odette, who now keeps him at arm's length, and suspects an affair between her and Forcheville, aided by the Verdurins. Swann seeks respite by attending a society concert that includes Legrandin's sister and a young Mme. de Guermantes; the ""little phrase"" is played and Swann realizes Odette's love for him is gone. He tortures himself wondering about her true relationships with others, but his love for her, despite renewals, gradually diminishes. He moves on and marvels that he ever loved a woman who was not his type.

At home in Paris, the Narrator dreams of visiting Venice or the church in Balbec, a resort, but he is too unwell and instead takes walks in theChamps-Élysées.  There he meets and befriends Gilberte. He holds her father, now married to Odette, in the highest esteem, and is awed by the beautiful sight of Mme. Swann strolling in public. Years later, the old sights of the area are long gone, and he laments the fleeting nature of places."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26264,The Return of the Native,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Native,"The novel takes place entirely in the environs ofEgdon Heath, and, with the exception of the epilogue,Aftercourses, covers exactly a year and a day. The narrative begins on the evening ofGuy Fawkes Nightas Diggory Venn is slowly crossing the heath with his van, which is being drawn by ponies. In his van is a passenger. When darkness falls, the country folk light bonfires on the surrounding hills, emphasising the pagan spirit of the heath and its denizens.

Venn is a reddleman; he travels the country supplying farmers with a red mineral calledreddle(dialect term for redochre) that farmers use to mark their sheep. Although his trade has stained him red from head to foot, underneath his devilish colouring he is a handsome, shrewd, well-meaning young man. His passenger is a young woman named Thomasin Yeobright, whom Venn is taking home. Earlier that day, Thomasin had planned to marry Damon Wildeve, a local innkeeper known for his fickleness; however, an inconsistency in the marriage licence delayed the marriage. Thomasin, in distress, ran after the reddleman's van and asked him to take her home. Venn himself is in love with Thomasin, and unsuccessfully wooed her two years before. Now, although he believes Wildeve is unworthy of her love, he is so devoted to her that he is willing to help her secure the man of her choice.

At length, Venn reaches Bloom's End, the home of Thomasin's aunt, Mrs. Yeobright. She is a good woman, if somewhat proud and inflexible, and she wants the best for Thomasin. In former months she opposed her niece's choice of husband, and publicly forbade thebanns; now, since Thomasin has compromised herself by leaving town with Wildeve and returning unmarried, the best outcome Mrs. Yeobright can envision is for the postponed marriage to be duly solemnised as soon as possible. She and Venn both begin working on Wildeve to make sure he keeps his promise to Thomasin.

Wildeve, however, is still preoccupied with Eustacia Vye, an exotically beautiful young woman living with her grandfather in a lonely house on Egdon Heath. Eustacia is a black-haired, queenly woman, whose Italian father came fromCorfu, and who grew up in Budmouth, a fashionable seaside resort. She holds herself aloof from most of the heathfolk; they, in turn, consider her an oddity, and some even think she is a witch. She is nothing like Thomasin, who is sweet-natured. She loathes the heath, yet roams it constantly, carrying aspyglassand anhourglass. The previous year, she and Wildeve were lovers; however, even during the height of her passion for him, she knew she only loved him because there was no better object available. When Wildeve broke off the relationship to court Thomasin, Eustacia's interest in him briefly returned. The two meet on Guy Fawkes night, and Wildeve asks her to run off to America with him. She demurs.

Eustacia drops Wildeve when Mrs. Yeobright's son Clym, a successful diamond merchant, returns from Paris to his nativeEgdon Heath. Although he has no plans to return to Paris or the diamond trade and is, in fact, planning to become a schoolmaster for the rural poor, Eustacia sees him as a way to escape the hated heath and begin a grander, richer existence in a glamorous new location. With some difficulty, she arranges to meet Clym, and the two soon fall in love. When Mrs. Yeobright objects, Clym quarrels with her; later, she quarrels with Eustacia as well.

When he sees that Eustacia is lost to him, Wildeve marries Thomasin, who gives birth to a daughter the next summer. Clym and Eustacia also marry and move to a small cottage five miles away, where they enjoy a brief period of happiness. The seeds of rancour soon begin to germinate, however: Clym studies night and day to prepare for his new career as a schoolmaster while Eustacia clings to the hope that he'll give up the idea and take her abroad. Instead, he nearly blinds himself with too much reading, then further mortifies his wife by deciding to eke out a living, at least temporarily, as afurze-cutter. Eustacia, her dreams blasted, finds herself living in a hut on the heath, chained by marriage to a lowly labouring man.

At this point, Wildeve reappears; he has unexpectedly inherited a large sum of money, and is now in a better position to fulfill Eustacia's hopes. He comes calling on the Yeobrights in the middle of one hot August day and, although Clym is at home, he is fast asleep on the hearth after a gruelling session of furze-cutting. While Eustacia and Wildeve are talking, Mrs. Yeobright knocks on the door; she has decided to pay a courtesy call in the hopes of healing the estrangement between herself and her son. Eustacia looks out at her and then, in some alarm, ushers her visitor out at the back door. She hears Clym calling to his mother and, thinking his mother's knocking has awakened him, remains in the garden for a few moments. When Eustacia goes back inside, she finds Clym still asleep and his mother gone. Clym, she now realises, merely cried out his mother's name in his sleep.

Mrs Yeobright, it turns out, saw Eustacia looking out the window at her; she also saw Clym's gear by the door, and so knew they were both at home. Now, thinking she has been deliberately barred from her son's home, she miserably begins the long, hot walk home. Later that evening, Clym, unaware of her attempted visit, heads for Bloom's End and on the way finds her crumpled beside the path, dying from anadder's bite. When she expires that night from the combined effects of snake venom andheat exhaustion, Clym's grief and remorse make him physically ill for several weeks. Eustacia, racked with guilt, dares not tell him of her role in the tragedy; when he eventually finds out from a neighbour's child about his mother's visit—and Wildeve's—he rushes home to accuse his wife of murder and adultery. Eustacia refuses to explain her actions; instead, she tells himYou are no blessing, my husbandand reproaches him for his cruelty. She then moves back to her grandfather's house, where she struggles with her despair while she awaits some word from Clym.

Wildeve visits Eustacia again on Guy Fawkes night, and offers to help her get to Paris. Eustacia realises that if she lets Wildeve help her, she'll be obliged to become his mistress. She tells him she will send him a signal by night if she decides to accept. Clym's anger, meanwhile, has cooled and he sends Eustacia a letter the next day offering reconciliation. The letter arrives a few minutes too late; by the time her grandfather tries to give it to her, she has already signalled to Wildeve and set off through wind and rain to meet him. She walks along weeping, however, knowing she is about to break her marriage vows for a man who is unworthy of her.

Wildeve readies a horse and gig and waits for Eustacia in the dark. Thomasin, guessing his plans, sends Clym to intercept him; she also, by chance, encounters Diggory Venn as she dashes across the heath herself in pursuit of her husband. Eustacia does not appear; instead, she falls or throws herself into nearby ShadwaterWeir. Clym and Wildeve hear the splash and hurry to investigate. Wildeve plunges recklessly after Eustacia without bothering to remove his coat, while Clym, proceeding more cautiously, nevertheless is also soon at the mercy of the raging waters. Venn arrives in time to save Clym, but is too late for the others. When Clym revives, he accuses himself of murdering his wife and mother.

In the epilogue, Venn gives up being a reddleman to become a dairy farmer. Two years later, Thomasin marries him and they settle down happily together. Clym, now a sad, solitary figure, eventually takes up preaching.

In a footnote towards the end of the novel in some compendium editions, Hardy writes:[2]

With its deeply flawed heroine and its (for the time) open acknowledgement of illicit sexual relationships,The Return of the Nativeraised some eyebrows when it first appeared as a serial inVictorian Britain. Although he intended to structure the novel into five books, thus mirroring theclassical tragicformat, Hardy submitted to the tastes of the serial-reading public sufficiently to tack on a happy ending for Diggory Venn and Thomasin in a sixth book,Aftercourses. In Hardy's original conception, Venn retains his weird reddleman's character, while Thomasin lives out her days as awidow.[3]

Hardy's choice of themes—sexual politics, thwarted desire, and the conflicting demands of nature and society—makes this a truly modern novel. Underlying these modern themes, however, is a classical sense of tragedy: Hardy scrupulously observes thethree unitiesof time, place, and action and suggests that the struggles of those trying to escape their destinies will only hasten their destruction.[4]To emphasise this main part he uses as setting an ancient heath steeped in pre-Christian history and supplies aChorusconsisting of Grandfer Cantle, Timothy Fairway, and the rest of the heathfolk. Eustacia, who manipulates fate in hopes of leaving Egdon Heath for a larger existence in Paris, instead becomes an eternal resident when she drowns in Shadwater Weir; Wildeve shares not only Eustacia's dream of escape, but also her fate; and Clym, the would-be educational reformer, survives the Weir but lives on as a lonely, remorseful man.

Some critics—notablyD. H. Lawrence—see the novel as a study of the way communities control theirmisfits. In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitablebridefor her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be awitch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia's supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her ineffigy. Clym at first laughs at suchsuperstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as afallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time—by drowning in theweirlike any woman instead of floating, witchlike—she proves her essential innocence to the community.[5]

Having lost all his money, their father is serving as achaplainfor theUnion Armyin theAmerican Civil War, far from home. The mother and daughters face their firstChristmaswithout him. When Marmee asks them to give their Christmasbreakfastaway to animpoverishedfamily, the girls and their mother venture into town, laden with baskets, to feed the hungry children. When they return, they discover their wealthy, elderly neighbor, Mr. Laurence, has sent over a decadent surprise dinner, to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted following these acts of kindness.

Meg and Jo must work to support the family: Megtutorsa nearby family of four children; Jo assists her agedgreat-auntMarch, a wealthywidowliving in amansionin Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is atomboywho writes, Beth is a peacemaker and apianist, and Amy is anartistwho longs for elegance andfine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters, as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. Laurie, Mr. Laurence's orphaned grandson, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo.

The girls keep busy as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can't comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties andcotillionsfor the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor.

Word comes that Mr. March is ill withpneumoniaand Marmee leaves to nurse him inWashington, DC. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her, but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence, instead, sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to marry, so, Brooke agrees to wait.

While Marmee is in Washington, Beth contractsscarlet fever, after spending time with a poor family, where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises the family send for Marmee. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy.

While Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After being wounded, he returns to find work, so he can buy a house for when he and Meg marry. Laurie goes to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns home.

(Published separately in the United Kingdom asGood Wives)

Three years later, Meg and John wed and work to adjust to married life. When they havetwins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel neglected. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing.

Laurie graduates from college, doing well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak, due to complications from scarlet fever, lowering her spirits. While trying to understand Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it is with Beth, but soon senses it is with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother but does not love him in a romantic way.

Jo wants a little adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will overcome his feelings. She spends six months in New York City with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house, serving asgovernessfor her two children. Jo takes German lessons from another boarder, Professor Friedrich Bhaer. He has come from Berlin to care for his sister's orphaned sons. For extra money, Jo anonymously writes salacious romance stories for sensational newspapers. Suspecting her secret, Friedrich mentions such writing is unprincipled and base, which persuade Jo to give up that literary genre. As Jo's time in New York ends, she is unaware that Friedrich is in love with her. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage, which she declines.

Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's scarlet fever has left her permanently weakened. Jo becomes devoted to caring for her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe and slowly falls in love with her, seeing her in a new light. She is unimpressed by his aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude since being rejected by Jo. She inspires him to find his purpose in life and do something worthwhile. News of Beth's death brings them together and a romance soon grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return home with Laurie and his grandfather unchaperoned. Amy and Laurie marry before leaving Europe.

Friedrich, in Massachusetts on business, visits the Marches daily for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo, who realizes she loves him and they become engaged. Because Friedrich is poor, he must first establish a good income and goes west to teach. A year passes without much success. Later, Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate, Plumfield, to Jo. She marries Friedrich and turns the house into a school for boys. They have two sons, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and five grandchildren.

Meg, the oldest sister, is 16, when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and she manages the household, when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and she is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfils expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect ""little woman,"" in the eyes of the world.[14]Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of ""little women"".[15]

Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father's family's social standing, Meg makes herdebutinto high society, but she is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie's tutor. They have twins, Margaret ""Daisy"" Brooke and John Laurence ""Demi"" Brooke. The sequel,Little Men,mentions a baby daughter, Josephine ""Josie"" Brooke,[16]who is 14, at the beginning of the final book.[17]

According to Sarah Elbert, ""democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all, a secure identity that Meg lacks"".[7]: 204Others believe Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life and writes her with loving detail, suffused with sentimentality.[18]

The principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.[19][20]

Second oldest of the four sisters, Jo is masculine, the smartest, most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his ""son Jo,"" and her best friend and neighbor, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, sometimes calls her ""my dear fellow,"" while she, alone, calls him Teddy. Jo has a ""hot"" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister, Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo.[21]In her essay, ""Recollections of My Childhood,"" Alcott refers to herself as a tomboy who enjoyed boys' activities, like running foot-races and climbing trees.

Jo lovesliterature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Laurie proposes marriage to Jo, which she rejects, thus confirming her independence. Another reason for the rejection is that the love that Laurie has for Jo is more a brotherly love, rather than romantic love, the difference between which he was unable to understand, because he was ""just a boy,"" as said by Alcott in the book.

After Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when ""they decide to share life's burdens, just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition"".[7]: 210She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred, until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March's home, a year later. According to criticBarbara Sicherman, ""The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.""[22]: 21They have two sons, Robert ""Rob"" Bhaer and Theodore ""Ted"" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part ofLittle Womenduring the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, ""her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence"".[7]: 199

Beth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family.[23]: 53Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family, and she gently scolds her sisters, when they argue.[24]As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth developsscarlet fever, after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease, but her health is permanently weakened.

As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually, she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew ""heavy.""  Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss duringLittle Womenis the death of beloved Beth. Her ""self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life, knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.""[7]: 206–207

Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family; she's 12, when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a ""regular snow-maiden,"" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, ""pale and slender"" and ""always carrying herself"" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family.[25]Often coddled, because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way, though she does still love her family.[26]: 5She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name, rather than a diminutive.[27]

Amy's aunt chooses her to accompany her to Europe, rather than her sister, Jo. There, she matures and makes a decision, based on her limited artistic talent, how to direct her adult life. She encounters Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence and his grandfather during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well in upper-class society and is at ease with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development, and her success in life seemed relatively accidental.[26]However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she can confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work hard to gain what she wants and make the most of her success, when she has it. She marries Laurie after Jo rejected him. They have a daughter, Elizabeth ""Bess"" Laurence, named after her late sister, Beth.[28]

For her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters inLittle Womenare recognizably drawn from family members and friends.[3][4]: 202Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister, was the model for Beth. Like Beth, Lizzie was quiet and retiring. She died tragically at age twenty-three from the lingering effects of scarlet fever, as did Beth.[39]May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls.[4]: 202Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as ""Miss March"" or ""Jo"", and she did not correct them.[40][41]: 31

However, Alcott's portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of theAmerican Civil War, a gainfully employedchaplain, and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel.[41]: 51In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters.[41]: 51The March family is portrayed as living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger.[42]In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised thatLittle Womenwas also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own early life.[29]: 6Originally, Alcott did not want to publishLittle Women, claiming she found it boring, and wasn't sure how to write girls as she knew few beyond her sisters. However, encouraged by her editor Thomas Niles, she wrote it within 10 weeks.[43]

Also,Little Womenhas several textual and structural references toJohn Bunyan'snovelThe Pilgrim's Progress.[44]Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the book and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times toThe Pilgrim's Progressand liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. Several chapter titles directly reference characters and places fromThe Pilgrim's Progress.

In addition to drawing on her own life during the development ofLittle Women,Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including ""The Sisters' Trial"", ""A Modern Cinderella"", and ""In the Garret"". The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott's own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters inLittle Women.[45]

The first volume ofLittle Womenwas published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers.[46]The first edition included illustrations byAbigail May Alcott, the sister commonly called ""May"" who inspired the fictional Amy March. She ""struggled"" with her illustrative additions to her sister's book, but later improved her skills and found some success as an artist.[47]

The first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with the demand for additional printings. They announced: ""The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott'sLittle Women, the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness.""[9]: 37The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume states: ""So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.""[48]Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year's Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.[10]: 345

Versions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine bothLittle WomenandGood Wivesinto one book under the titleLittle Women, with the latter marked as Part 2 (chapters 24 to 47).[49]Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with: ""In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.""[48]

The British influence, giving Part 2 its own title,Good Wives, has the book still published in two volumes, withGood Wivesbeginning three years afterLittle Womenends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed underLittle Womenappear to include both parts, especially in the audiobook versions.[citation needed]Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s to 2015.[citation needed]This split of the two volumes also shows at Goodreads, which refers to the books as theLittle Womenseries, includingLittle Women,Good Wives,Little MenandJo's Boys.[50][51][52]

G. K. Chestertonbelieved Alcott inLittle Women, ""anticipatedrealismby twenty or thirty years"", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, ""is one of the really human things in human literature"".[53]Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of ""pilgrims progress"" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.[54]

Little Womenwas well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a ""scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood"", which led more women to look toward ""literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.""[22]: 2Little Womenbecame ""the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured"".[22]: 3Adult elements of women's fiction inLittle Womenincluded ""a change of heart necessary"" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.[7]: 199

In the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of ""a decline in the radical power of women's fiction"", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a ""hearth and home"" children's story.[7]: 197Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed thatLittle Womenwas the beginning of this ""downward spiral"". But Elbert says thatLittle Womendid not ""belittle women's fiction"" and that Alcott stayed true to her ""Romantic birthright"".[7]: 198–199

Little Women's popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown ""within the familiar construct of domesticity"".[7]: 220While Alcott had been commissioned to ""write a story for girls"", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a ""new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories"".[22]: 3–4

One reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.[22]: 3–4""Both the passionLittle Womenhas engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.""[22]: 35

At the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her ""who the little women marry"".[22]: 21Sicherman said that the ending, which she personally characterizes as ""unsatisfying"", worked to ""keep the story alive"" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.[22]: 21Anne E. Boyd contends that ""Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writingLittle Women"".[55]Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. In Sicherman's opinion, Alcott used Friedrich to ""subvert adolescent romantic ideals"" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo.[22]: 21However, the character was partially based upon older men Alcott was attracted to, such asHenry David ThoreauandRalph Waldo Emerson,[31][35]or admired, such as German writersCharles FollenandJohann Wolfgang von Goethe.[35][32][33]In particular, Alcott had considered Goethe her ""chief idol"" since the day Emerson had introduced her to Goethe and handed her a copy ofWilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship[34]Bhaer is also representative of Alcott's reverence forGerman culture.[56]

In 2003Little Womenwas ranked number 18 inThe Big Read, a survey of the British public by theBBCto determine the ""Nation's Best-loved Novel"" (not children's novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list.[57]Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S.National Education Associationlisted it as one of its ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[58]In 2012 it was ranked number 47 among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal, a monthly with primarily US audience.[59]

Little Womenhas been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report inThe New York Timesand cited inLittle Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays.[60]Ruth MacDonald argued that ""Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls' novel and the family story"".[61]

In the 1860s, gendered separation of children's fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs ""as class stratification increased"".[22]: 18Joy Kasson wrote, ""Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them.""[62]Girls related to the March sisters inLittle Women, along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.[22]: 22

After readingLittle Women,some women felt the need to ""acquire new and more public identities,"" however dependent on other factors, such as financial resources.[22]: 55WhileLittle Womenshowed the regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also ""legitimized"" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities.[22]: 36More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and ""stories of individual achievement—traditionally coded male—challenged women's socialization into domesticity"".[22]: 55Little Womenalso influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into the middle-class culture.

In the pages ofLittle Women, young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles.[22]: 35Little Womenrepeatedly reinforced the importance of ""individuality"" and ""female vocation"".[22]: 26Little Womenhad ""continued relevance of its subject"" and ""its longevity points, as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s"".[22]: 35Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages ofLittle Womento see how a ""democratic household"" would operate.[7]: 276

While ""Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity,"" she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society, solely because they were not married.[7]: 193""Little Womenindisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood, by insisting that the home and the women's sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world, while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements."" As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular, Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood, because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.[7]: 199

Alcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse asMaxine Hong Kingston,Margaret Atwood, andJ. K. Rowlinghave noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.[63]

Alcott's novel is often celebrated for Jo and her narrative arch in which she becomes a self-determined woman with a career. However, framing this novel as a success, solely for Jo's accomplishments, portrays it as a ""traditional 'lone genius' patriarchal narrative"" in which only women who are ""categorized as 'exceptional' or particularly 'worthy'"" are celebrated.[64]Little Womenawards all its women worthy, despite their status as conventional or unconventional—not just Jo, who is the obvious exception to societal expectation. Alcott's novel celebrates the agency of women, the four sisters and their mother, to choose their path in life. Meg makes the decision to marry and have children and though it is the traditional pathway, she makes the choice for her own happiness. Thus, reducing Alcott's novel to just Jo's experience as an exception promotes it as a patriarchal narrative and erases her careful work to portray a matriarchal narrative, rich with female agency and voice.

Alcott ""made women's rights integral to her stories, and above all, toLittle Women"".[7]: 193Alcott's fiction became her ""most important feminist contribution""—even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights"".[7]: 193She thought that ""a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society."" InLittle Women, she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth-century feminist utopia.[7]: 194

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17157,Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels,"The travel begins with a short preamble in whichLemuel Gullivergives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall, much like thelittle people in mythology, who are inhabitants of the island country ofLilliput. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput Royal Court. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on the condition that he must not hurt their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver aids the Lilliputians against the rival island nation of Blefuscu by stealing its entire naval fleet. However, he refuses to reduce Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, ""a considerable person at court"", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home with some Lilliputian animals he carries with him.

Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing shipAdventureis blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the North American continent.

The grass ofBrobdingnagis as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72 ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being 10 yards (9 m). Thegiantfarmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter Glumdalclitch cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the queen's service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his ""travelling box"".

Between small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the roof by a monkey, he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The king is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannon. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22962,Mansfield Park,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_Park,"Ten-year-old Fanny Price is sent from her impoverished home inPortsmouthto live with the family at Mansfield Park. Lady Bertram is Fanny’s aunt and her four children – Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia – are older than Fanny. All but Edmund mistreat her and her other aunt, Mrs Norris, wife of the clergyman at the Mansfield parsonage, makes herself particularly unpleasant.

When Fanny is fifteen, Aunt Norris is widowed and her visits to Mansfield Park increase, as does her mistreatment of Fanny. A year later, Sir Thomas leaves to deal with problems on his sugar plantation inAntigua, taking with him his spendthrift eldest son Tom. Mrs Norris, looking for a husband for Maria, finds the rich but weak-willed Mr Rushworth, whose proposal Maria accepts but only for his money.

Henry Crawfordand his sisterMaryarrive at the parsonage to stay with their half-sister, the wife of the new incumbent, Dr Grant. With their fashionable London ways, they enliven the great house. Edmund and Mary then start to show interest in one another.

On a visit to Mr Rushworth's estate, Henry flirts with both Maria and Julia. Maria believes Henry is in love with her and so treats Mr Rushworth dismissively, provoking his jealousy, while Julia struggles with jealousy and resentment towards her sister. Mary is disappointed to learn that Edmund will be a clergyman and tries to undermine his vocation.

After Tom returns to Mansfield Park ahead of his father, he encourages the young people to begin rehearsals for an amateur performance ofElizabeth Inchbald'splayLovers' Vows. Edmund objects, believing Sir Thomas would disapprove and feeling that the subject matter is inappropriate but, after much pressure, he agrees to take on the role of the lover of the character played by Mary. The play also provides further opportunity for Henry and Maria to flirt. When Sir Thomas arrives home unexpectedly, he is furious to find the play still in rehearsal and it is cancelled. Henry departs without explanation, and in reaction Maria goes ahead with marriage to Mr Rushworth. The couple then settle in London, taking Julia with them. Sir Thomas sees many improvements in Fanny and Mary Crawford initiates a closer relationship with her.

When Henry returns to Mansfield Park, he decides to entertain himself by making Fanny fall in love with him. Fanny's brother William visits, and Sir Thomas holds what is effectively acoming-out ballfor her. Although Mary dances with Edmund, she tells him it will be the last time, as she will never dance with a clergyman. Edmund drops his plan to propose and leaves the next day, as do Henry and William.

When Henry next returns, he announces to Mary his intention to marry Fanny. To assist his plan, he has used his family's naval connections to help William achieve promotion. However, when Henry proposes marriage, Fanny rejects him, disapproving of his past treatment of women. Sir Thomas is astonished by her continuing refusal, but she does not explain, afraid of compromising Maria.

To help Fanny appreciate Henry's offer, Sir Thomas sends her to visit her parents in Portsmouth, where she is taken aback by the contrast between their chaotic household and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits, but although she still refuses him, she begins to appreciate his good features.

Later, Fanny learns that Henry and Maria have had an affair which is reported in the newspapers. Mr Rushworth sues Maria for divorce and the Bertram family is devastated. Tom meanwhile falls gravely ill. Edmund takes Fanny back to Mansfield Park, where she is a healing influence. Sir Thomas realises that Fanny was right to reject Henry's proposal and now regards her as a daughter.

During a meeting with Mary Crawford, Edmund discovers that Mary's regret is only that Henry's adultery was discovered. Devastated, he breaks off the relationship and returns to Mansfield Park, where he confides in Fanny. Eventually the two marry and move to Mansfield parsonage after Dr Grant secures a post in Westminster. Meanwhile, those left at Mansfield Park have learned from their mistakes and life becomes pleasanter there."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1526,"Twelfth Night; Or, What You Will",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night,"Viola is shipwrecked on the coast ofIllyriaand comes ashore with a captain's help. She has lost contact with her twin brother, Sebastian, who she believes has drowned, and with the aid of the Captain, she disguises herself as a young man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino. Orsino has convinced himself he is in love with Olivia, who is mourning her brother's recent death. Olivia refuses to see entertainments, be in the company of men, or accept love or marriage proposals from anyone, including Orsino, until seven years have passed. Orsino then uses 'Cesario' as an intermediary to profess his passionate love for Olivia. But Olivia falls in love with 'Cesario', setting her at odds with her professed duty. Meanwhile, Viola has fallen in love with Orsino, creating a love triangle: Viola loves Orsino, Orsino loves Olivia, and Olivia loves Viola disguised as Cesario.

In the comic subplot, several characters conspire to make Olivia's pompous steward, Malvolio, believe that she has fallen for him. This involves Olivia's riotous uncle, Sir Toby Belch; another would-be suitor, the silly squire Sir Andrew Aguecheek; Olivia's servants Maria and Fabian; and Olivia's witty fool, Feste. Sir Toby and Sir Andrew engage themselves in drinking and revelry, disrupting the peace of Olivia's household until late into the night, prompting Malvolio to chastise them. Sir Toby famously retorts,

Maria suggests taking revenge on Malvolio by convincing him that Olivia is secretly in love with him. She forges a love letter, mimicking Olivia's handwriting, and plants it in the garden. The letter asks Malvolio to wear yellow stockings cross-gartered—a colour and fashion that Olivia hates, to be rude to the rest of the servants, and to smile constantly in Olivia's presence. Watched by Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian, Malvolio finds the letter and is surprised and delighted. He starts following the letter's instructions to show Olivia his feelings. Olivia is shocked by the changes in him and, agreeing that he seems mad, leaves him to be cared for by his tormentors. Pretending that Malvolio is insane, the tormentors lock him in a dark chamber. Feste visits Malvolio to mock Malvolio's professed insanity, both as himself and disguised as a priest.

Meanwhile, Viola's twin, Sebastian, has been rescued by Antonio, a sea captain who previously fought Orsino, yet who accompanies Sebastian to Illyria, despite the danger, because of his admiration for Sebastian.

With their love for practical jokes, Sir Toby and Fabian convince Sir Andrew to challenge Cesario to a duel, knowing that neither of them can fight. Their initial duel is interrupted by Antonio, who believes Cesario to be Sebastian. Orsino's officers then arrest Antonio. Emboldened by this, Sir Andrew mistakes Sebastian for Cesario and slaps him, prompting Sebastian to beat up Sir Andrew. Olivia witnesses the skirmish and chastises Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian. Taking Sebastian for 'Cesario', Olivia asks him to marry her, and they are secretly married in a church. Finally, when 'Cesario' and Sebastian appear in the presence of both Olivia and Orsino, there is more wonder and confusion at their physical similarity. At this point, Viola reveals her identity and is reunited with her brother.

Sebastian and Viola reunite, and the cases of mistaken identity are resolved. Orsino and Viola marry (Orsino to Viola: ""But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen""[2]), and Antonio is released. Fabian confesses the plot against Malvolio, and reveals that Sir Toby has married Maria. Malvolio swears revenge on his tormentors and stalks off, but Orsino sends Fabian to placate him. The plays end with a song sung by Feste.

Illyria, the exotic setting ofTwelfth Night, is important to the play's romantic atmosphere.

Illyria was an ancient region of the Western Balkans whose coast (the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, the only part of ancient Illyria relevant to the play) covered (from north to south) the coasts of modern-daySlovenia,Croatia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Montenegro, andAlbania. It included the city-state of theRepublic of Ragusa, which has been proposed as the setting, and which is today known asDubrovnik,Croatia.[3]

Illyria may have been suggested by the Roman comedyMenaechmi, the plot of which also involves twins who are mistaken for each other. Illyria is also referred to as a site of pirates in Shakespeare's earlier play,Henry VI, Part 2.Most of the characters' names are Italian but some of the comic characters have English names. Oddly, the ""Illyrian"" lady Olivia has an English uncle, Sir Toby Belch.

It has been noted that the play's setting has other English allusions, such as Viola's use of ""Westward ho!"", a typical cry of 16th-century London boatmen, and Antonio's recommendation to Sebastian of ""The Elephant"" as the best place to lodge in Illyria (The Elephantwas a pub not far from the Globe Theatre).[4]

The play is believed to have drawn extensively on the Italian productionGl'ingannati(The Deceived Ones),[5]collectively written by theAccademia degli IntronatiofSienain 1531. It is conjectured that the name of its male lead, Orsino, was suggested byVirginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, an Italian nobleman who visited London in the winter of 1600–01.[6]

Another source story, ""Of Apollonius and Silla"", appeared inBarnabe Riche's collectionRiche his Farewell to Militarie Profession conteining verie pleasaunt discourses fit for a peaceable tyme(1581), which in turn derives from a story byMatteo Bandello.[7]

""Twelfth Night"" is a reference to the twelfth night afterChristmas Day, also called theEve of theFeast of Epiphany. It was originally a Catholic holiday, and these were sometimes occasions for revelry, like other Christian feast days. Servants often dressed up as their masters, men as women, and so forth. This history of festive ritual and carnivalesque reversal[a]is the cultural origin of the play's gender-confusion-driven plot. Puritans often opposed Epiphany celebrations, much as Malvolio opposes the revelry in the play.[8]

The actual Elizabethanfestival of Twelfth Nightinvolved the antics of aLord of Misrule, who, before leaving his temporary position of authority, called for entertainment, songs, andmummery; the play has been regarded as preserving this festive and traditional atmosphere of licensed disorder.[9]: 153This leads to the general inversion of the order of things, most notably gender roles.[9]: 227The embittered and isolated Malvolio can be regarded as an adversary of festive enjoyment and community.[9]: 254That community is led by Sir Toby Belch, ""the vice-regent spokesman for cakes and ale"", and his partner in a comic stock duo, the simple and constantly exploited Sir Andrew Aguecheek.[10]

The full title of the play isTwelfth Night, or What You Will.Subtitlesfor plays were fashionable in theElizabethan era, and though some editors placeThe Merchant of Venice's alternative title,The Jew of Venice, as a subtitle, this is the only Shakespeare play to bear one when first published.[11]

The play was probably finished between 1600 and 1601, a period suggested by the play's referencing of events that happened during that time. A law student,John Manningham, who was studying in the Middle Temple in London, described the performance on 2 February 1602 (Candlemas) which took place in the hall of the Middle Temple at the formal end of Christmastide in the year's calendar, and to which students were invited.[12]This was the first recorded public performance of the play. The play was not published until its inclusion in theFirst Folioin 1623.

Viola is not alone among Shakespeare's cross-dressing heroines; in Shakespeare's theatre, convention dictated that adolescent boys play female characters, creating humour in the multiplicity of disguise found in a female character who for a while pretended at masculinity.[11]Her cross-dressing enables Viola to fulfil usually male roles, such as acting as a messenger between Orsino and Olivia or serving as Orsino's confidant. But she does not use her disguise to intervene directly in the plot (unlike other Shakespearean heroines, such as Rosalind inAs You Like Itand Portia inThe Merchant of Venice), remaining someone who allows ""Time"" to untangle the plot.[13]

AsTwelfth Nightexplores gender identity and sexual attraction, having a male actor play Viola enhanced the impression of androgyny and sexual ambiguity.[14]Some modern scholars believe thatTwelfth Night, with the added confusion of male actors and Viola's deception, addresses gender issues ""with particular immediacy"".[15]They also accept that its depiction of gender stems from the era's prevalent scientific theory that females are simply imperfect males.[14]This belief explains the almost indistinguishable differences between the sexes reflected in the play's casting and characters.

At Olivia's first meeting with ""Cesario"" (Viola) in Act I, Scene v she asks her ""Are you a comedian?"" (an Elizabethan term for ""actor"").[16]Viola's reply, ""I am not that I play"", epitomising her adoption of the role of ""Cesario"" (Viola), is regarded as one of the play's several references to theatricality and ""playing"".[17]The plot against Malvolio revolves around these ideas, and Fabian remarks in Act III, Scene iv: ""If this were play'd upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction"".[18]In Act IV, Scene ii, Feste (The Fool) plays both parts in the ""play"" for Malvolio's benefit, alternating between adopting the voice of the localcurate, Sir Topas, and his own voice. He finishes by likening himself to ""the old Vice"" of English Morality plays.[19]Other influences of the English folk tradition can be seen in Feste's songs and dialogue, such as his final song in Act V.[20]The last line of this song, ""And we'll strive to please you every day"", echoes similar lines from several English folk plays.[21]

Some scholars argue thatTwelfth Night, or What You Will(the play's full title) was probably commissioned for performance as part of the Twelfth Night celebrations held byQueen Elizabeth IatWhitehall Palaceon 6 January 1601 to mark the end of the embassy of the Italian diplomat, the Duke of Orsino.[22]Others dispute this, arguing that the ""rigid etiquette of Queen Elizabeth's court"" would have made it ""impossible"" for Shakespeare to name a main character in a comedy for the very diplomat attending the performance, and that it is more likely that Shakespeare used the name from the 1601 diplomatic visit when writing his play, which premiered the next winter.[23]It was again performed at Court on Easter Monday in 1618 and onCandlemasnight in 1623.

The earliest public performance took place atMiddle Temple Hall, one of theInns of Court, on 2 February (Candlemas night) 1602. The lawyerJohn Manninghamwrote in his diary:

Clearly, Manningham enjoyed the Malvolio story most of all, and noted the play's similarity to Shakespeare's earlier play, as well as its relationship with one of its sources, theInganniplays.

The play was one of the earliest Shakespearean works acted at the start of theRestoration; SirWilliam Davenant's adaptation was staged in 1661, withThomas Bettertonas Sir Toby Belch.Samuel Pepysthought it ""a silly play"", but saw it three times anyway during the period of his diary on 11 September 1661, 6 January 1663, and 20 January 1669. Another adaptation,Love Betray'd, or, The Agreeable Disappointment, was acted atLincoln's Inn Fieldsin 1703.[6]

After holding the stage only in the adaptations in the late 17th century and early 18th century, the original Shakespearean text ofTwelfth Nightwas revived in 1741, in a production atDrury Lane. In 1820 an operatic version byFrederic Reynoldswas staged, with music byHenry Bishop.

Influential productions were staged in 1912, byHarley Granville-Barker, and in 1916, at theOld Vic.

Lilian Baylisreopened the long-dormantSadler's Wells Theatrein 1931 with a notable production of the play starringRalph Richardsonas Sir Toby andJohn Gielgudas Malvolio. TheOld Vic Theatrewas reopened in 1950 (after suffering severe damage in theLondon Blitzin 1941) with a memorable production starringPeggy Ashcroftas Viola.Gielguddirected a production at theShakespeare Memorial TheatrewithLaurence Olivieras Malvolio andVivien Leighplaying both Viola and Sebastian in 1955. The longest-runningBroadwayproduction by far wasMargaret Webster's 1940 staging starringMaurice Evansas Malvolio andHelen Hayesas Viola. It ran for 129 performances, more than twice as long as any otherBroadwayproduction.

A memorable production directed byLiviu Ciuleiat theGuthrie Theaterin Minneapolis in 1984 was set in the context of an archetypal circus world, emphasising the play's convivial,carnivalesquetone.[26]

When the play was first performed, all female parts were played by men or boys, but it has been the practice for some centuries now to cast women or girls in the female parts in all plays. The company ofShakespeare's Globe, London, has produced many notable, highly popular all-male performances, and a highlight of their 2002 season wasTwelfth Night, with the Globe's artistic directorMark Rylanceplaying Olivia. This season was preceded, in February, by a performance of the play by the same company at Middle Temple Hall, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the play's première, at the same venue.Stephen FryplayedMalvoliowhen the same production was revived in 2012–13, later transferring to sell-out runs in theWest EndandBroadway; it ran inrepertorywithRichard III.[27]

Many renowned actresses have played Viola in the latter half of the 20th century, and their performances been interpreted in the light of how far they allow the audience to experience the transgression of stereotypical gender roles.[28](p 15)This has sometimes correlated with how far productions of the play go towards reaffirming a sense of unification; for example, a 1947 production concentrated on showing a post-World War II community reuniting at the end of the play, led by a robust hero / heroine in Viola, played byBeatrix Lehmann, then 44 years old.[28](pp 18–20)The 1966Royal Shakespeare Companyproduction played on gender transgressions more obviously, withDiana Riggas Viola showing much more physical attraction towards the duke than previously seen, and the court in general being a more physically demonstrative place, particularly between males.[28](p 30)John Barton's 1969 production starredDonald Sindenas Malvolio andJudi Denchas Viola; their performances were highly acclaimed and the production as a whole was said to show a society crumbling into decay.[28](p 34)

Malvolio is a popular character choice among stage actors; he has been portrayed byIan Holmmany times,Simon Russell Beale(Donmar Warehouse, 2002),Richard Cordery(2005),Patrick Stewart, (Chichester, 2007),Derek Jacobi(Donmar Warehouse, 2009),Richard Wilson(2009),[29]andStephen Fry(The Globe, 2012).[27]

In 2017, theRoyal National Theatre's production ofTwelfth Night[30]changed some of the roles from male to female, including Feste, Fabian (who became Fabia), and, most notably, Malvolio – who became Malvolia – played byTamsin Greigto largely positive reviews.[31][32][33][34]As a result, the production played with sexuality as well as gender.

In 2017–18, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Christopher Luscombe;Adrian Edmondsonplayed Malvolio,Kara TointonOlivia, andDinita GohilViola.[35]

In 2022, Old Fruit Jar Productions staged a 1980s-inspired twist on the play atRoyal Court Theatre, Liverpool, swapping lords and ladies of stately homes for rowdyBenidormbars and booze-fuelled escapades, as an introduction to Shakespeare for audiences unfamiliar with his work.

Due to its themes such as young women seeking independence in a ""man's world"", ""gender bending"" and ""same sex attraction"",[36]there have been a number of re-workings for the stage, particularly in musical theatre, among themYour Own Thing(1968),Music Is(1977),All Shook Up(2005), andPlay On!(1997), the last twojukebox musicalsfeaturing the music ofElvis PresleyandDuke Ellington, respectively. Another adaptation isIllyria(2002) by composerPete Mills, which continues to perform regularly throughout the United States. In 2018, thePublic Theatreworkshopped and premiered a musical adaptation ofTwelfth Nightwith original music byShaina Taub, who also played the role ofFeste.[37]In 1999, the play was adapted asEpiphanyby theTakarazuka Revue, adding more overt commentary on the role of theatre and actors, as well as gender as applied to the stage (made more layered by the fact that all roles in this production were played by women).[38][39]There are many new modern plays but mostly still played in Early Modern English.

Theatre Grottesco, aLecocq-inspired company based out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, created a modern version of the play from the point of view of the servants working for Duke Orsino and Lady Olivia, entitledGrottesco's 12thNight(2008).[40][41]The adaptation takes a much deeper look at the issues of classism, and society without leadership.  In New York City, Turn to Flesh Productions, a theatre company that specializes in creating ""new Shakespeare shows"", developed two plays focused onMalvolio:A Comedy of Heirors, or The Impostersby verse playwright,Emily C. A. Snyder, which imagined a disgraced Malvolio chasing down two pairs of female twins in Syracuse and Ephesus, andMalvolio's Revengeby verse playwright,Duncan Pflaster, a queer sequel toTwelfth Night.[42][43][44][45]Both plays were originally written for submission to theAmerican Shakespeare Center's call for plays in conversation with the Bard through theShakespeare's New Contemporariesprogram."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20593,Anne of Green Gables,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables,"Anne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke,Nova Scotia(based upon the real community ofNew London, Prince Edward Island),[16][17]is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally sought to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm atGreen Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based onCavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.

Anne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelled with an ""e"" at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles, and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay.

Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables.

The book recounts Anne's struggles and joys in settling into Green Gables (the first real home she's ever known): the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or ""bosom friend"" as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmateGilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes several times. As time passes, however, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but her pride and stubbornness keep her from speaking to him.

The book also follows Anne's adventures in Avonlea. Episodes include playtime with her friends Diana, calm, placid Jane Andrews, and beautiful, boy-crazy Ruby Gillis. She has run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters, Gertie and Josie, and frequent domestic ""scrapes"" such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thinks is raspberry cordial but which turns out to be currant wine.

At sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana, much to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship awarded to the top student in English. This scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the realDalhousie College) on the mainland in Nova Scotia.

Near the end of the book, however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School in favor of Anne, to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next.

Anne of Green Gableswas first published byL.C. Page & Co.ofBostonon June 13, 1908.[18]The book quickly became a best-seller, selling over 19,000 copies in the first five months. Since then, over 50 million copies have been sold worldwide.[19]A full scan of the first edition, first impression is provided by the L. M. Montgomery Institute.

Montgomery's original manuscript is preserved by theConfederation Centre of the Arts, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since 2022, the Centre has hosted a project in which digital images of the entire manuscript can be examined online. A transcript of the manuscript was published by Nimbus Publishing in 2019.

Montgomery's original typescript and the corrected proofs are lost.[20]

The first edition has errors in the text. Critical editions will identify corrections that have been applied to the text by the editor. The choice of corrections depends on the editor and varies across editions. As an example, thePenguin Classicsedition,[21]edited by Benjamin Lefebvre, lists the following corrections:

Based on the popularity of her first book, Montgomery wrote a series of sequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley.

The prequel,Before Green Gables(2008), was written byBudge Wilsonwith the authorization of the heirs of L. M. Montgomery.

TheGreen Gablesfarmhouse is located inCavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions onPrince Edward Islandhave been developed based on the fictional Anne, and provincial license plates once bore her image.[22]Balsam Hollow, the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods and Campbell Pond, the body of water which inspired The Lake of Shining Waters, both described in the book, are located in the vicinity.[23]In addition, theConfederation Centre of the Artshas featured the wildly successfulAnne of Green Gables musicalon its mainstage every summer for over five decades, until 2020 and the Covid pandemic.[24]The Anne of Green Gables Museum is located in Park Corner, PEI, in a home that inspired L. M. Montgomery.[25]

The province and tourist facilities have highlighted the local connections to the internationally popular novels.Anne of Green Gableshas been translated into 36 languages.[26][27]""Tourism byAnnefans is an important part of the Island economy"".[28]Merchants offer items based on the novels.

In 2019, Canadian publishing company Bradan Press crowdfunded aScottish-Gaelictranslation ofAnne of Green Gables, titled Anna Ruadh, through the crowdfunding websiteKickstarter. The book, released in 2020, is the first Scottish-Gaelic translation ofAnne of Green Gables.[29][30]

The novel has been popular in Japan, where it is known asRed-haired Anne(赤毛のアン(Akage no An)),[31][32]and where it has been included in the national school curriculum since 1952. 'Anne' is revered as ""an icon"" in Japan, especially since 1979 when this story was broadcast asanime,Anne of Green Gables. Japanese couples travel to Prince Edward Island to have civil wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm. Some Japanese girls arrive as tourists with red-dyed hair styled in pigtails, to look like Anne.[33]In 2014, theAsadora'Hanako to Anne', which was aboutHanako Muraoka, the first person to translate Anne into Japanese, was broadcast and Anne became popular among old and young alike.

A replica of the Green Gables house in Cavendish is located in the theme park Canadian World inAshibetsu, Hokkaido, Japan. The park was a less expensive alternative for Japanese tourists instead of traveling to P.E.I. The park hosted performances featuring actresses playing Anne and Diana. The theme park is open during the summer season with free admission, though there are no longer staff or interpreters.[34]

The Avonlea theme park near Cavendish and the Cavendish Figurines shop have trappings so that tourists may dress like the book's characters for photos.[35]Souvenir shops throughout Prince Edward Island offer numerous foods and products based on details of the 'Anne Shirley' novels. Straw hats for girls with sewn-in red braids are common, as are bottles of raspberry cordial soda.[36]

The first filmed appearance of Anne Shirley was in the 1919 silent film,Anne of Green Gables, in which the role was played byMary Miles Minter. The film was directed byWilliam Desmond Taylor. As of 2011, no prints of this silent film adaptation are known to survive. The 1919 film version moved the story from Prince Edward Island to New England, which one American critic—unaware that the novel was set in Canada—praised for ""the genuine New England atmosphere called for by the story"".[46]Montgomery herself was infuriated with the film for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary:

Montgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she had portrayed ""a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne"", and complained about a scene where Shirley waved about a shotgun as something as her Anne would never do.[47]

In the1934 adaptationof the novel, Anne was portrayed byDawn O'Day, who legally changed her name to ""Anne Shirley."" She reprised the role inAnne of Windy Poplars, a 1940 film adaptation. Montgomery liked the 1934 film more than the 1919 film, not least because now the book's dialogue could be portrayed on the silver screen and that two scenes were filmed on location in Prince Edward Island (though the rest of the film was shot in California), but still charged that neither the 1919 nor 1934 versions ofAnne of Green Gablesquite got her book right.[48]Writing about the 1934 version ofAnne of Green Gables, Montgomery wrote in her diary that it was a ""thousand times"" better than the 1919 version, but still it: ""was so entirely different frommyvision of the scenes and the people that it did not seem likemybook at all"".[47]The British scholarFaye Hammillwrote that 1934 film version stripped Anne of the ""Canadian and feminist"" aspects that the Anne of the books possessed, stating that there was something about Anne that Hollywood cannot get right.[48]Hammill observed that the idea that Anne was entirely cheerful is a product of the film and television versions as the Anne of the books has to deal with loss, rejection, cruel authority figures, and loneliness.[48]

As one of the most familiar characters in Canadian literature,Anne of Green Gableshas been parodied by several Canadian comedy troupes, includingCODCO(Anne of Green Gut) andThe Frantics(Fran of theFundy)."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/696,The Castle of Otranto,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Otranto,"The Castle of Otrantotells the story of Manfred, lord of the castle, and his family. The book begins on the wedding day of his sickly son Conrad and princess Isabella. Shortly before the wedding, however, Conrad is crushed to death by a gigantic helmet that falls on him from above. This inexplicable event is particularly ominous in light of an ancient prophecy: ""That the castle and lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it."" Manfred, terrified that Conrad's death signals the beginning of the end for his line, resolves to avert destruction by marrying Isabella himself while divorcing his current wife, Hippolita, who he feels has failed to bear him a proper heir in light of the sickly condition of Conrad before his untimely death.

However, as Manfred attempts to marry Isabella, she escapes to a church with the aid of a peasant named Theodore, who had correctly identified the giant helmet that had killed Conrad as having come from the giant statue standing before the church. Manfred accuses Theodore of having sorcerous responsibility for the helmet having been summoned. Manfred orders Theodore's death while talking to the friar Jerome, who ensured Isabella's safety at the church. When Theodore removes his shirt to be killed, Jerome recognizes a mark below his shoulder and identifies Theodore as his own son, and thus being of noble birth. Jerome, who has revealed himself to be of noble rank, begs for his son's life, but Manfred says Jerome must either give up the princess or his son's life. They are interrupted by a trumpet and the entrance of knights from another kingdom who want to deliver Isabella to her father, Frederic, along with the castle, as Frederic has a stronger claim to it (another reason Manfred wishes to wed Isabella). This leads the knights and Manfred to race to find Isabella.

Theodore, having been locked in a tower by Manfred, is freed by Manfred's daughter, Matilda. He races to the underground church and finds Isabella. He hides her in a cave and blocks it to protect her from Manfred and ends up fighting one of the mysterious knights. Theodore badly injures the knight, who turns out to be Isabella's father, Frederic. With that, they all go up to the castle to work things out. Frederic falls in love with Matilda, and he and Manfred make a deal to marry each other's daughters. However, Frederic backs out after being warned by an apparition of a skeleton.

Manfred, suspecting that Isabella is meeting Theodore in a tryst in the church, takes a knife into the church, where Matilda is meeting Theodore. Thinking his own daughter is Isabella, he stabs her. Theodore is then revealed to be the true prince of Otranto as Matilda dies, leaving Manfred to repent. A giant ghostly form appears, declares the prophecy fulfilled, and shatters the castle walls.

Manfred abdicates the principality and retires to religion along with Hippolita. Theodore becomes prince of the remains of the castle and is married to Isabella, for she is the only one who can truly understand his sorrow.

In the preface of the second edition, Walpole claims the novel is ""an attempt to blend the two kinds ofromance, the ancient and the modern."" He defines the ""ancient"" romance by its fantastic nature (""its imagination and improbability"") while defining the ""modern"" romance as more deeply rooted inliterary realism(""a strict adherence to common life,"" in his words).[5]By combining fantastic situations (helmets falling from the sky, walking portraits, etc.) with supposedly real people acting in a ""natural"" manner, Walpole created a new and distinct style ofliterary fiction, which has frequently been cited as a template for all subsequent gothic novels.[1][4]The Monthly Reviewstated that for ""[t]hose who can digest the absurdities of Gothic fiction""Otrantooffered ""considerable entertainment"".[11]

TheCastle of Otrantois the first supernatural English novel and is a singularly influential work of Gothic fiction.[1]It blends elements of realist fiction with the supernatural and fantastical, establishing many of the plot devices and character types that would become typical of the Gothic novel: secret passages, clanging trapdoors, pictures beginning to move, and doors closing by themselves.[1]The poetThomas Graytold Walpole that the novel made ""some of us cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed o’nights.""[14]

The first and most obvious connection toWilliam Shakespeareis presented by Horace Walpole himself, in the preface to the second edition ofOtranto, in which he ""praises Shakespeare as a truly original genius and the exemplar of imaginative liberty, as a part of a defense ofOtranto's design"".[15]Elsewhere, Walpole's several allusions to works by Shakespeare further emphasize the connection he wishes to draw between his own work and Shakespeare's. For example, inHamlet, ""Hamlet's encounter with the Ghost becomes for Walpole a template for terror"".[15]

Walpole presents a ""more fragmented recasting"" of the Ghost inHamlet, which had served as a representation of the ""now unsanctioned, but still popular Catholic view of ghosts as speakers of truth"" for Shakespeare.[16]TheCatholicelements at play within bothHamletandOtrantoare invoked to represent a further sense of wonder and mystery to the Protestant audiences of both works. The Catholic element was a necessary facet of the ""template of terror"" that Walpole meant to invoke.

The allusion to Hamlet's experience with the Ghost is meant not only as a ""template of terror,"" but also to make readers feel as if they are watching the play itself, and Walpole does this on three occasions. First, he posits Manfred's encounter with the animated portrait of Ricardo as a connection to the Ghost's initial appearance to Hamlet. Second, when Friar Jerome informs Theodore of the dangers to be found in Otranto and calls for him to take revenge, this is a direct allusion to the Ghost's demand to Hamlet to remember him. Third, Frederic's encounter with the skeletal apparition parallels the final appearance of the Ghost inHamlet.[15]

The violent question of bloodlines and succession serves as a key element in many of Shakespeare's plays, fromHamlettoRichard IIandMacbeth, and it is clearly one of the major concerns ofOtranto. The link toHamletis strengthened even more because of the incest that is also at play inOtranto. ""InOtranto, the castle and its labyrinths become grounds for incest that signal the dissolution of familial bonds"",[17]which is also a major point of issue inHamletsince Hamlet's mother (Gertrude) and his uncle (Claudius) were, in a way, related before their marriage. BothHamletandOtrantoare literary springboards for discussion of the questions of marriage, as the question ofHenry VIII's annulment of his marriage and later marriage toAnne Boleynwere still heated topics of controversy. Henry VIII had married his brother's wifeCatherine of Aragonand later dissolved that marriage due to Catherine's inability to produce a male heir who lived to adulthood. Similarly,Otrantorevolves around ""a larger sexual contest to secure lineage"".[18]

The final connection betweenOtrantoand Shakespeare lies in the role that the servants play. Like Shakespeare, Walpole aims to create a ""mixture of comedy and tragedy,""[16]and one of the ways he does so is by using the minor, servant characters (such as Bianca) ascomic relief. This is a trope that Walpole takes from Shakespeare as, for example, Shakespeare'smechanicalsfromA Midsummer Night's Dreamalso serve as the key comic element in the play.

Horace Walpole's aesthetic productions, especially his home atStrawberry Hill House, have been interpreted through the lens ofqueer theoryand described ascamp.[19][20]The Castle of Otrantois seen as establishing a literary foundation in which sexual desire and transgression is a defining thematic undercurrent of the new genre of the Gothic.[19][21]Max Fincher has written that Manfred is preoccupied with the threat of his identity being discovered in a way that parallels the fear of homoerotic desire being discovered. He argues thatmisogynyin the novel is an attempt to project manliness, overcompensating for the author's or character's fears of queerness or weakness. Because of these fears, he argues, the book presents non-heteronormativebehavior as ""unnatural and demonic.""[22]

Otrantois generally credited with creating the entire Gothic novel genre. It was a smash hit in its day, until the author revealed that it was purely satirical fiction rather than an actual adaptation of medieval text. At that point, the critics and populace who had praised it turned on the book, claiming it was superficial, and other pejoratives generally assigned to romantic novels, which were seen as inferior in Britain at that time. But its impact was dramatic. The novelistClara ReevewroteThe Old English Baron(1777) as a response, claiming she was taking Walpole's plot and adapting it to the demands of the time by balancing fantastic elements with 18th-century realism.[1]She explained:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/284,The House of Mirth,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_Mirth,"Lily Bart, aged 29, is an impoverished socialite who seeks a husband to secure her future. Her success is challenged by her advancing age — at twenty-nine, she has been on the ""marriage market"" for more than ten years — and her debts from gambling atbridge. Lily admires lawyer Lawrence Selden, but he is too poor for her to seriously consider marrying; instead, her only prospects are the coarse and vulgar Simon Rosedale, a financier, and the wealthy but dull Percy Gryce.

Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury — an atmosphere which she believes she cannot live without. The loss of her father's wealth, coupled with the death of her parents, left her an orphan at twenty. Lacking an inheritance or a caring protector, she adapts to life as a ward of her strait-laced aunt, Julia Peniston, from whom she receives an erratic allowance, a fashionable address, and food, but little direction or parenting. Lily loathes the neglectful Julia but is forced to rely on her for her necessities and luxuries.

Lily learns that Selden and heiress Bertha Dorset were once lovers. She also confides her money problems to Gus Trenor, a stockbroker and the husband of her childhood friend Judy, receiving from him a check for $5,000 and an investment of $4,000 in her name. Trenor tries to exploit his generosity to make a romantic move, but Lily spurns his attentions. Bertha still has feelings for Lawrence notwithstanding her recent breakup with him. Selden still has feelings for Lily and aims to ruin the latter's budding romance with Percy by filling him in on salacious and scandalous rumors about Lily's card-playing and past romantic life. This effectively frightens Percy away. Lily, unaware of Bertha's machinations, blames Judy for having been the one to set the match up.

In retribution for a social snub, Lily's cousin Grace Stepney informs Julia of rumors that Lily is having an affair with Gus to obtain money so she can pay off her gambling debts. This plants seeds of doubt and discomfort in Julia who, though shocked, chooses to accept the rumors without speaking to her niece.

Furthermore, Lily has soured her relationships with both Gus, who is angered by her spurning him, and Judy, because she refuses to visit her at Bellomont lest Gus confront her and reveal that she had manipulated him for financial gain.

To avoid having to spend time alone with Julia, the Trenors, Simon Rosedale, or anyone else she considers a possible source of embarrassment or boredom, Lily begins to accept invitations from people with whom she would not ordinarily socialize. These include the Wellington Brys, who are newcomers to the New York social scene, and whose social rise is being engineered by Carry Fisher. Carry, a fallen aristocrat who supports herself by acting as a social secretary to usher newly wealthy people into fashionable society, invites Lily to social events hosted by Louisa Bry. Lily also attends the opera with Carry, Simon, and Gus. In the eyes of high society, Lily cheapens herself by voluntarily associating with her social inferiors. She returns to Bellomont only to find that her peers now look at her with derision and disgust.

One of Julia's temporary servants, who is also the charwoman at Selden's apartment, sells Lily a package of torn love letters. These were written by Bertha Dorset years earlier, and they represent a chance for Lily to deal with her enemy. But instead of blackmailing Bertha into a positive relationship, Lily tries to neutralize the gossip by making herself useful to Bertha. Bertha, who is in a sexual relationship with Ned Silverton, relies on Lily to distract her husband, George.

The extent to which Lily's reputation is damaged becomes obvious when she publicly appears in a way that comes across as advertising her availability for an illicit relationship. Following Carry's advice, the Wellington Brys throw a large ""general entertainment""[12]featuringtableaux vivantsportrayed by a dozen fashionable women in their set, including Miss Bart.

Thepièce de résistanceof this successful event turns out to be the portrayal of Mrs. Lloyd inSir Joshua Reynolds'famous 18th-century painting (1775–1776). The portrait shows a woman suggestively clad.[h][14]As the curtain opens on this last scene, the gasp of approval heard from the audience is not so much for Reynolds' interpretation of Mrs. Lloyd as it is for the loveliness of Lily Bart herself — marking the pinnacle of her social success but also the annihilation of whatever reputation is left to her. For better or for worse, she has transitioned from a marriageable ""girl"" to a not-quite-reputable woman similar to Carry Fisher. Yet she does not do as Carry Fisher does and accept the loss of her respectability as the price she must pay to maintain a position in society.

As Selden observes her in thetableau, he sees the real Lily Bart as if for the first time[i]and feels the desire to be with her. He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the musical interlude, as the collective praise from her admirers is subsiding. Selden leads her to a garden and tells her that he loves her. They eventually kiss. Lily sighs, "" 'Ah, love me, love me—but don't tell me so!' "" and takes her leave.[j]As Selden gathers his coat to leave, he is disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne's remarks, "". . . .Gad, what a show of good-looking women; but not one of 'em could touch that little cousin of mine. . . . I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has.""

Lily pleads with Julia to help settle her debts and confesses her addiction to gambling. Julia feels taken advantage of and refuses to help, except to cover the bill for her clothes and accessories. Feeling trapped and disgraced, Lily turns to thoughts of Selden as her savior and has a change of heart towards him as she looks forward to his next visit at four o'clock.

Instead, her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who, smitten by her appearance in thetableau,proposes a marriage that would be mutually beneficial. Considering what Rosedale knows about her, she pleads for time to consider his offer.[k]Selden does not appear for his 4:00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation. Instead, he has departed forHavanaand then on toEuropefor a business trip.

To escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial dealings with Gus, and also disappointed by what she interprets as Selden's emotional withdrawal, Lily accepts Bertha's spur-of-the-moment invitation to join her and George on a Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht; Lily is expected once again to hide Bertha's affair. Lily's decision to accept the offer proves to be her social undoing.

To divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle away from her, Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic and sexual liaison with George by instructing her not to sleep on the yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Brys held for the Duchess inMonte Carlo. Selden inadvertently helps by arranging a night's lodging, under the promise that she leave in the morning. The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily's reputation and causes friends to abandon her and Julia to disinherit her.

Undeterred, Lily fights to regain her place in high society by advising Mr. and Mrs. Gormer on their entry into the aristocracy, but when the couple learn of the ""scandalous"" personal background of their new secretary, they chase her out rather than risk losing their new standing. Only two friends remain for Lily: Gerty Farish (a cousin of Lawrence Selden) and Carry, who help her cope with the social ignominy of a degraded social status while continually advising Lily to marry soon.

Despite the efforts of both Carry and Farish, Lily descends through thesocial strataof New York City's high society. She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs. Hatch, a disreputable woman who nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young man in Lily's former social circle. During this occupation, she is introduced to the use of chloral hydrate, sold in drugstores, as a remedy formalaise. Selden warns her that working for Mrs Hatch is putting her in a false position, and once she realises the truth of this, Lily resigns. She then finds a job in amilliner'sshop; unaccustomed to working-class manual labor, her rate of production is low, and the quality of her workmanship is poor, exacerbated by her increased use of the drug. She is fired at the end of the New York social season, when the demand for fashionable hats has diminished.

Meanwhile, Simon reappears in her life and tries to rescue her, but Lily is unwilling to meet his terms. Simon wants Lily to use the love letters that she bought from Selden's servant to expose the love affair between Lawrence and Bertha, thus crushing a potential rival and allowing him to further ascend up the social ladder. For the sake of Selden's reputation, Lily does not act upon Rosedale's request and secretly burns the letters when she visits Selden one last time.

Lily is stopped on the street by Nettie Struther, who Lily once helped get to a sanatorium. Nettie is now married and has a baby girl. Touched by Lily's exhausted state, and eager to show her how she has profited from her help, she invites her back to her modest tenement home, and introduces her to the baby.

Eventually, Lily receives a ten-thousand-dollar inheritance following Julia's death, which she uses to repay Gus. Distraught by her misfortunes, Lily is now crippled by drug dependence. Once she has repaid all her debts, Lily takes an overdose and dies; perhaps it issuicide, perhaps an accident. While dying, she hallucinates cradling Nettie's baby in her arms. That morning, Lawrence arrives at her quarters to propose marriage, but finds Lily dead. Among her belongings are bank receipts proving that her dealings with Gus were honorable and that the rumors that destroyed her were always false. This realization allows a distraught Selden to feel sympathy for her.

Lily Bart— Wharton paints Lily, the 29-year-old heroine of her novel, as a complex personality with a given name that suggests purity and a surname that implies defiance,[l]and the foolishness that the title of the novel implies. The combination of the social pressures and conventions of her reference group and her refusal to ""settle"" numerous times to save herself portend a fateful destiny where she becomes complicit in her own destruction.[16]Wharton depicts Lily as having an aesthetic purpose in life—a fine specimen to be looked at and admired. Her extraordinary beauty should have served her well to find a wealthy husband with the requisite social status that would have secured her place in upper-class New York society. However, her inner longing to become free of her society's social conventions, her sense of what is right, and her desire for love as well as money and status have thwarted her success in spite of a number of eligible admirers over the ten years she has been on the marriage market. Challenges to her success are her advancing age—she is 29 as the novel begins—the loss of her father's wealth, and the death of her parents which has left her orphaned without a caring protector, her constant efforts to ""keep up with the Joneses""(4),[m]the very modest but erratic ""allowance"" from her strait-laced Aunt Julia, and her gambling debts which make her the subject of vile gossip. To protect Lawrence Selden's reputation, she refuses to use damning evidence against her nemesis, Bertha Dorset, which would have recouped her ruined social standing. This leads to a tragic yet heroic ending.

Lawrence Selden— A young lawyer who, although not wealthy himself, is able to move easily within and without Old New York's elite social circles through kinship with old-line New York families. He has known Lily since her ""coming out"" eleven years earlier. For all this time he has been in the background of her life. He views the comings and goings of New York's high society with the detachment and the objectivity of an outsider —a characteristic that Lily not only admires but also that allows her to view those people in her surroundings in an objective, critical and a not-so-flattering way. She becomes fascinated and envies his independence from the ""tribe"" and the freedom that has given him.[n]Her encounters with Selden underscore the conflict between her inner voice —her self-hood at its core— and the outer voices of her reference group. It is from Selden's description, assessment and admiration of Lily's outward characteristics that we glean those attributes that contribute to New York high society's perception and misperceptions of who she is. He can be brutally honest about Lily's superficiality and artificiality and simultaneously appreciate the sparks of freedom and spontaneity that temper these negatives. These mutual admirable qualities give way to their romantic regard for one another. He is not, however, free from the social pressure of rumor. Though he has shown Lily consistent friendship, he abandons her when she becomes the victim of appearances that put her virtue, as an unmarried woman, in question.

Simon Rosedale— A successful and socially astute Jewish businessman—the quintessentialparvenu—who has the money but not the social standing to be accepted into the circle of New York's leisure class. Building his fortune in real estate, Rosedale makes his first appearance in the story when he observes Lily leaving his apartment building after what appears to be atrystwith one of his tenants. Rosedale is interested in Lily because not only is she beautiful, but what is more important, she is also a social asset in gaining him a place in high society. She reflects that she has put herself in his power by her clumsy dress-maker fib and her refusal to allow him to take her to the station which would have given him the prestige of being seen by members of the society with whom he was aspiring to gain acceptance. As his social ascent continues, he offers Lily marriage which would provide her a way out of her financial dilemma and her precarious social standing; she puts him off. His cleverness and business acumen serve him well to achieve a higher and higher rung on the social ladder. Lily, however, is on her way down to the point that Rosedale is no longer interested in marrying her. Despite the differences in their social standing, Rosedale by the end of the story shows compassion for Lily. He offers her a loan when he runs into her after she has lost her hat-making job—an offer she refuses.

Percy Gryce— A conservative, rich, but shy and unimaginative young eligible bachelor on whom Lily, with the support of her friend Judy Trenor, sets her sights. Percy's less than titillating personality notwithstanding, Lily works out a strategy to catch him at week-long festivities at Bellomont. Her fortuitous and successful encounter with Percy on the train to Bellomont further encourages her in pursuit of her goal. Her strategy gets interrupted, however, when Selden at week's end also appears on the scene unexpectedly. Lily then decides, on the spur of the moment, to set aside her well-thought-out tactics to pursue Percy in favor of spending some time with Selden. When, at a more rational moment, she returns to pursuing Percy, his mother-in law-to-be tells Lily at Jack Stepney's and Gwen Van Osburgh's wedding about his engagement to Evie Van Osburgh.

Bertha Dorset (Mrs. George Dorset)— A petite and pretty high-society matron whose husband George is extremely wealthy. She is first introduced catching the train to Bellomont where she boards with great fanfare and commotion. She demands that the porter find her a seat with her friends, Lily and Percy. Once at Bellomont Judy Trenor intimates to Lily that Bertha is manipulative and also unscrupulous such that it is better to have her as a friend rather than an enemy. It is well known that Bertha is bored with her husband and seeks attention and love outside the confines of marriage. At Bellomont Bertha continues to pursue Selden in an attempt to rekindle the flame of an adulterous affair they have been carrying on but with which he has become disenamored. As Book I ends, she invites Lily to accompany her on a Mediterranean cruise to distract her husband so she can carry on an affair with Ned Silverton. Bertha understands, as a married woman, she must keep up appearances and ruthlessly impugns Lily's reputation to mask her own adultery. She spreads false rumors that besmirch Lily's virtue among their friends. Lily, as an unmarried woman without a protector, has little she can do in her own defense.

Mrs. Peniston (Julia)— Lily's wealthy, widowed Aunt –sister to Lily's father. Mrs. Peniston embodies ""old-school"" morality and has a family pedigree that goes back to the industrious and successful Dutch families of early New York. Although she maintains an opulent residence on fashionable Fifth Avenue, she does not follow fashion or renovate constantly to maintain a chic appearance. In Lily's eyes, the Peniston home is therefore dingy. Mrs. Peniston's ""Old New York"" lifestyle requires keeping her drawing room neat, eating well and dressing expensively. She harbors a passive attitude and does not actively engage in life. Although she spends time in the country during the first part of the book, by the last half of the book she is a shut-in with significant heart problems. When Lily arrived in New York in financial distress after the death of her mother, Mrs. Peniston took pleasure in the public display of her generosity by agreeing to take Lily on for a year after her mother died—much to the relief of the extended family. She found, to her surprise, that she liked the volatile Lily. She therefore continued to support Lily for over a decade during Lily's fruitless search for a wealthy, socially connected husband. She indulges and passively enables Lily's habit of gallivanting with her fashionable friends, and ignores the way Lily avoids and abandons her. Although Lily is clearly Julia's favorite, displacing her previous favorite Grace Stepney, Julia never makes any verbal or written promise to provide for Lily in the long term. Although Lily and her friends believe that is ""understood"" that she will inherit most if not all of Julia's fortune, Julia herself never made such a statement. Indeed, her forbearance is stretched to the limit when rumors reach her that Lily gambles for money and is encouraging attention from married men who compensate her for it. As upset as Julia is by evidence of Lily's immoral behavior, she does not immediately ask Lily for details because it is easier to discredit the messenger. When Lily comes to Julia asking for money to pay various debts, including what Lily passes off as gambling debts, Julia refuses. The relationship is permanently damaged, and when Lily sails away with the Dorsets instead of cleaning up the social and financial mess she has made, Julia does not write to Lily or attempt to repair the relationship. When word reaches her that Lily has been publicly accused of having an affair with George Dorset, and when Lily continues to gallivant in Europe instead of returning home, Julia disinherits Lily in favor of the more loyal Grace Stepney. By the time Lily returns to New York, Julia has died, and nobody knows about the disinheritance until her will is read.

Judy Trenor (Mrs. Gus Trenor)— Lily's best friend and confidante— is the stereotypical high-society matron, married to Gus Trenor, a successful business man. She frequently hosts large parties and social events at their country home, Bellomont. By engaging in gossip Mrs. Trenor keeps up on the social scene. She acts as matchmaker between Lily and Percy Gryce. She uses Lily as her surrogate private secretary and spends much of her day making sure that every detail of her events is done to perfection. This includes poring over lists to decide which guests are the most desirable to invite, which have been ""stolen"" by another conflicting event, and which unmarried men and women should be set up together. She invites Selden to Bellomont on anonymous advice to keep Mrs. George Dorset entertained. Judy suffers from frequent headaches and avoids noisy environments such as the opera. She must sometimes cancel minor engagements on short notice, and prefers to stay at Bellomont when her head hurts.

Gus Trenor—Judy Trenor's husband—a massive man with a heavy carnivorous head and a very red complexion. He is a successful stock market speculator and an advocate of Simon Rosedale's acceptance in high society circles although he considers him abounder. He is also a notorious flirt and looks for attention in relationships with women outside of his marriage. Gus becomes enamored with Lily, a frequent guest at his wife's weekend social events. He uses his financial investment skills and a large sum of his own money in a risky investment for Lily which she agrees to. The proceeds from this speculation will help her pay her gambling debts and other expenses necessary to keep up appearances. The investment pays off for Lily financially, as Gus intends that it should, but the friendship turns sour when Lily is unwilling to exchange romantic attention for money the way Gus believes she tacitly agrees to do.

Carry Fisher (Mrs. Fisher)— A small, fiery and dramatic divorcée. She is perceived as carrying ""a general air of embodying a 'spicy paragraph';""(70)[1]and according to Mrs. Trenor, "". . .most of her alimony is paid by other women's husbands."" (91)[1]She sponges money from Gus Trenor to cover her bills much to his wife's chagrin. Although Gus accepts romantic favors from Mrs. Fisher in exchange for paying her bills and investing her money in the stock market, he considers her a ""battered wire-puller""(94)[1]in comparison to the fresh and unsullied Miss Bart. Carry is also known for bringing newcomers into high society such as Rosedale and the Wellington Brys, who had managed the miracle of making money in a falling market. After Lily has been expelled from the upper class by Bertha, Carry is one of the few people who still show compassion toward her, offering Lily support and job opportunities. Carry is an example of a woman who finds ways to earn money and to succeed in society despite being divorced and somewhat disreputable. Her presence in the story refutes the notion that Lily has no choice except to self-destruct.

Ned Silverton— A young man, whose first intention was to live on proofreading and write an epic, but ended up living off his friends. Ned's romantic relationship at the Bellomont house party is with Carry Fisher. Six months later, Ned accompanies Lily and the Dorsets on their Mediterranean cruise. He has an affair with Mrs Dorset, who manages to keep it concealed from most of society. Ned's increasing gambling addiction consumes not only his resources but that of his sisters, who live in poverty while he travels with Bertha Dorset. After the fling with Bertha ends, Ned participates in a scheme to help a purportedly wealthy but disreputable woman to marry the younger brother of Gwen and Evie Van Osburgh. This conspiracy, in which Lily is implicated, helps ensure Lily's downfall.

Evie Van Osburgh— A young, innocent, dull, and conservative, stay-at-home kind of a girl, heiress to a substantial fortune. Judy Trenor paired her sister, Gwen, with Percy Gryce at the Sunday-night supper at Bellomont. Evie ends up getting engaged within six weeks of their stay at Bellomont to Percy Gryce due to Bertha Dorset's match-making skills.

Gerty Farish— Selden's cousin. She is a kind, generous woman who occupies herself with charity work, but Lily despises her because of her less than glamorous appearance. In Book Two, Gerty becomes one of Lily's only friends, giving her a place to stay and taking care of her when everyone else abandons her. Lily does not wish to continue living with Gerty or combining resources because she is unwilling to lower herself to the standard of living Gerty can afford.

Jack Stepney and Gwen (Van Osburgh) Stepney— A very wealthy couple—guests at Bellomont just before celebrating their wedding at the Van Osburgh's estate six weeks later. They belong to Old New York's high society, although their money comes from Gwen's side. Prior to his marriage, the nearly bankrupt Jack has business dealings with Simon Rosedale and has tried to afford him entrée into New York's high society. After marrying Gwen, Jack becomes plump, conservative, and complacent. Jack is Lily's cousin so he agrees to shelter her for the night after Bertha kicks her off her yacht for ostensibly carrying on romantically with Bertha's husband.

Grace Stepney— Lily's middle-aged cousin lives in a boarding house and has spent most of her life waiting on Julia Peniston. Until Lily arrived, Grace was Julia's favorite: she shares Julia's conservatism and sense of propriety, and she is willing to help out during the fall cleaning. Grace attracts and remembers all manner of gossip related to high society in general and to Lily in particular, but does not generally gossip herself. Lily treats Grace very poorly, regarding her as insignificant. When Lily prevails on her aunt Julia to exclude Grace from a family dinner party, Grace retaliates. She relays to Aunt Julia the talk about Lily's attention to Gus Trenor in exchange for money that Lily used to pay gambling debts, and stops protecting Lily from the otherwise predictable consequences of Lily's actions. When Lily comes to Grace after the reading of the will, Grace does not have the money to give Lily the loan she is asking for because the assets Grace inherited from Julia are still tied up in probate. When Lily asks Grace to borrow money against Aunt Julia's estate and lend or give it to Lily, Grace refuses.

In the contemporary book review ""New York Society Held up to Scorn in three New Books"" (15 October 1905)The New York Timescritic said thatThe House of Mirthis ""a novel of remarkable power"" and that ""its varied elements are harmoniously blended, and [that] the discriminating reader who has completed the whole story in a protracted sitting, or two, must rise from it with the conviction that there are no parts of it which do not properly and essentially belong to the whole. Its descriptive passages have verity and charm, it has the saving grace of humor, its multitude of personages, as we have said, all have the semblance of life.""[17]

The publication of the novel prompted letters to the editor of the ""New York Times Saturday Review of Books"" which argued the merits of the story, saying that the novel was a faithful and true portrait of the New York City gentry, while detractors said that it impugned the character of the city's social élite as a heartless and materialistleisure class.[18]

The novelThe House of Mirth(1905) has been adapted to radio, the stage and the cinema."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2992,The Middle-Class Gentleman,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Bourgeois_gentilhomme,"The play takes place at Mr. Jourdain's house inParis. Jourdain is a middle-aged ""bourgeois"" whose father grew rich as acloth merchant. The foolish Jourdain now has one aim in life, which is to rise above this middle-class background and be accepted as anaristocrat. To this end, he orders splendid new clothes and is very happy when the tailor's boy mockingly addresses him as ""my Lord"". He applies himself to learning the gentlemanly arts of fencing, dancing, music and philosophy, despite his age; in doing so he continually manages to make a fool of himself, to the disgust of his hired teachers. His philosophy lesson becomes a basic lesson on language in which he is surprised and delighted to learn that he has been speakingproseall his life without knowing it.

Madame Jourdain, his intelligent wife, sees that he is making a fool of himself and urges him to return to his previous middle-class life, and to forget all he has learned. A cash-strapped nobleman called Dorante has attached himself to M. Jourdain. He secretly despises Jourdain but flatters his aristocratic dreams. For example, by telling Jourdain that he mentioned his name to theKingatVersailles, he can get Jourdain to pay his debts. Jourdain's dreams of being upper-class go higher and higher. He dreams of marrying aMarchioness, Dorimène, and having his daughter Lucile marry a nobleman. But Lucile is in love with the middle-class Cléonte. Of course, M. Jourdain refuses his permission for Lucile to marry Cléonte.

Then Cléonte, with the assistance of his valet Covielle and Mme Jourdain, disguises himself and presents himself to Jourdain as the son of theSultan of Turkey. Jourdain is taken in and is very pleased to have his daughter marry foreign royalty. He is even more delighted when the ""Turkish prince"" informs him that, as father of the bride, he too will be officially ennobled at a special ceremony. The play ends with this ridiculous ceremony, including theSabirlanguage standing in for Turkish.

The original production brought together the finest actors and musicians of the time. Molière played the role of Monsieur Jourdain, clothed in bright colors trimmed with silver lace and multicolored feathers; André Hubert played Madame Jourdain (travesti); Mlle de Brie played Dorimène;Armande Béjartplayed Lucile; and the composerJean-Baptiste Lullydanced themuftiin the last actcérémonie des Turcs.

Le Bourgeois gentilhommereflected the then-current trend forles turqueries,all things related to theOttoman Empire. The work stemmed from the scandal caused by the Turkish ambassadorSuleiman Agawho, upon visiting the court ofLouis XIVin 1669, affirmed the superiority of the Ottoman court over that of the Sun King.

The first performance ofDer Bürger als Edelmann, a German version of the play, took place on 25 October 1912,adaptedbyHugo von Hofmannsthalwithincidental musicbyRichard Strauss. Theturqueriewas replaced by an appendedoperaticentertainmentAriadne auf Naxos, composed by Strauss to alibrettoby Hofmannsthal, in which Jourdain's eccentric requirements have led toAriadnebeing marooned on a desert island where there just happens to be acommedia dell'artetroupe. The production was directed byMax Reinhardt. The combination of play and opera proved problematic. Hofmannsthal created a revised version of the play, reinstating theturquerieand removing the opera. Strauss provided further incidental music including some arrangements of Lully. Meanwhile, the entertainment was provided with a separate operatic prologue and this is the form in whichAriadneis now usually given.[2]

George Balanchinechoreographed a number ofmodern versions, from the 1930s to the 1970s, using Strauss's score. The first version was performed in 1932 byWassily de BasilandRené Blum'sBallet Russe de Monte-Carlo, featuringDavid LichineandTamara Toumanova, with sets byAlexandre Benois.[3]In 1944, a new version of the ballet was performed by the second iteration of theBallet Russe de Monte-Carlo, withNicholas Magallanes(taking over for an injuredFrederic Franklin),Maria Tallchief, andNathalie Krassovska.[3]The most well-known version, from 1979 for theNew York City Opera, featured input fromJerome Robbins, who stepped in during a period of Balanchine's illness.[3]Peter Martinsalso choreographed one scene near the end of the ballet.[4]The production starredJean-Pierre Bonnefoux,Patricia McBride,Rudolf Nureyev,Darla Hoover,Michael Puleoand students of theSchool of American Ballet.

In 2005Le Poème Harmoniquein collaboration withBenjamin Lazar[fr](stage director) andCécile Roussat[fr](choreographer) presentedLe Bourgeois gentilhommeat the Utrecht Baroque Festival. Informed by the musical and theatrical traditions of 17th century France, the production revived the musical and dance interludes originally scored byJean-Baptiste Lullyand the work was presented in its entirety. The wardrobe was notably bourgeois and ridiculous, evidently the intent of the directors to present Monsieur Jordain as a naive, stunned and yet vulnerable man new to the world of money and privilege ""victim and architect of the action"". The use of candlelight as the only lighting source on stage and a frontal performance style even during conversations between characters gave the production a distinctly baroque air and was well received. The 2005 production was the first ever since the play's first performance to render it in its entirety, as faithful as possible to the original score and script by Molière and Lully.

Many male and female musicians, instrumentalists, dancers, cooks, tailor's apprentices, and others are needed for the interludes.

An hour-long version adapted by Harry McFadden was broadcast on theNBC radioseriesGreat Playson December 18, 1938.[citation needed]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32,Herland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herland_(novel),"The story is told from the perspective of Vandyck ""Van"" Jennings, asociologystudent who, along with two friends, Terry O. Nicholson and Jeff Margrave, forms an expedition party to explore an area of uncharted land rumored to be home to a society consisting entirely of women. The three friends do not entirely believe the rumors because they are unable to think of a way how human reproduction could occur without males. The men speculate about what a society of women would be like, each guessing differently based on the stereotype of women which he holds most dear: Jeff regarding women as things to be served and protected; Terry viewing them as things to be conquered and won.[1]

When the explorers reach their destination, they proceed with caution, hiding thebiplanethey arrive in, and trying to keep themselves hidden in the forests that border the land. They are quickly found by three young women who they realize are observing them from the treetops. After attempting to catch the girls with trickery, the men end up chasing the young women towards a town or village. The women easily outrun them and disappear among the houses, which, Van notes are exceptionally well made and attractive. After meeting the first inhabitants of this new land (which Van names ""Herland"") the men proceed more cautiously, noting that the girls they met were strong, agile, and completely unafraid. Their caution is warranted, because as the men enter the town where the girls disappeared, they become surrounded by a large group of women, who march them towards an official-looking building. The three men attempt an escape, but are swiftly and easily overpowered by the large group of women and eventually anesthetized.

The men awake to find themselves held captive in a fortress-like building. They are given comfortable living accommodations, clean clothes, and food. The women assign each man a tutor who teaches the men their language. Van makes many notes about the new country and people, commenting that everything from their clothing to their furniture seems to be made with the twin ideals ofpragmatismandaestheticsgiven equal consideration. The women themselves appear intelligent and astute, unafraid and patient, with a notable lack of temper and seemingly limitless understanding for their captives. The women are keen to learn about the world outside and question the men eagerly about all manner of things. Often Van finds himself having difficulty justifying the practices of his own society such as the milking of cows, and the keeping of property, when faced with the apparent utopia the women have managed to build.

After being held captive for a number of months, the men break out of the fortress and escape cross-country to where they left their biplane. Finding the biplane sewn inside a large fabric covering, the men are unable to get away and are resignedly recaptured by the women. They are treated well nonetheless and soon learn that they will be given a freer rein when they have mastered the women's language and prove they can be trusted. Van remarks upon Terry's personal difficulty in dealing with the women, who steadfastly refuse to conform to his expectations of how women should act, though Jeff seems perfectly enamored by the women and their kindness.

Van gradually finds out more information about the women's society, discovering that most of the men were killed 2,000 years ago when a volcanic eruption sealed off the only pass out of Herland. The remaining men were mostly slaves who killed the sons of their dead masters and the old women, intending to take over the land and the young women with it. The women fought back, however, killing the slaves. After a period of hopelessness at the impending end of their race, cut off from the rest of the world and without any men, one woman among the survivors became pregnant and bore a female child, and four more female children after. The five daughters of this woman also grew up to bear five daughters each. This process rapidly expanded their population and led to the exaltation of motherhood. Ever since that time the women had devoted themselves to improving their minds, working together and raising their children; the position of teacher being one of the most revered and respected positions in the land.

As the men are allowed more freedom, each strikes up a relationship with one of the women they had first seen upon their arrival: Van with Ellador, Jeff with Celis, and Terry with Alima. Having had no men for 2,000 years, the women apparently have no experience or cultural memory of romantic love or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the couples' budding relationships progress with some difficulty and much explanation. Terry in particular finds it hard to adjust to being in a relationship with a woman who is not a 'woman' in his terms. Eventually all three couples get 'married', although the women largely fail to see the point of such a thing, and as they have no particular religion, the ceremony is morepaganthan Christian.

Their marriages cause the men much reflection; the women they married have no conception of what being a wife or being feminine entails. Van finds it frustrating sometimes, though in the end he is grateful for his wonderful friendship with Ellador and the intense love he feels for her. Terry is not so wise, and out of frustration attempts torapeAlima. After being forcefully restrained and once again anesthetized, Terry stands trial before the women and is ordered to return to his homeland. The other men, while disapproving of Terry's actions, see them as merely impolite rather than criminal. Van explains to Ellador, ""[Crime]'s a pretty hard word for it. After all, Alima was his wife, you know.""

Van realizes that he must accompany Terry home in the biplane and Ellador will not let him leave without her. In the end, both Terry and Van leave Herland with promises not to reveal the utopia until Ellador has returned and such a plan has been fully discussed. Jeff chooses to stay behind and live in Herland with his now pregnant wife, Celis. Van tries to prepare Ellador for returning to his world but feels much trepidation about what she will find there.

The book highlights the theme of community essential to the all-female society. The women maintain individuality while deriving their ideals from reaching a consensus with the majority of the population. The community arrives at decisions on the procreation of children by referring toeugenics.[2]The community of women engage in ""negative eugenics"" by weeding out those considered incompetent and/or less attractive. Gilman provides commentary on the importance of obtaining a strong sense of community in a Utopian novel.

Gilman's writings are highly popularized by feminists for their undeniable resemblance to contemporary feminism. Gilman promotes feminism with her emphasis on thereproductive rightsof women regardless of the man's opinion.[3]For instance, the women ofHerlandaccentuate the value of motherhood, as they reproduce viaparthenogenesis, a symbol of their independence and capabilities as women. Gilman openly proposed notions of feminism, regardless of the unconventionality and negative reception in the early 20th century.

This book is significant because it dramatically envisions a fictional utopia presenting the philosophy described in Gilman's critically acclaimed feminist bookWomen and Economicsby visually demonstrating her critique on the unnatural dependence of females on malebreadwinners.[4]InHerland,the removal of men incites a new economic freedom of women. Gilman uses this utopia to further prove the theories defined in ""Women and Economics"" such as Lester Ward's ""Gynaecocentric Theory,"" which declares that ""the female sex is primary and the male secondary in the organic scheme.""[5]However, these ideas are grounded in a mode ofSeparatist Feminismwhich some argue is detrimental to the feminist movement.

Herland helps establish a very early economic model favoring the female worker by adhering to social reproduction. In ""The Waste of Private Housekeeping,"" Gilman states: ""The principle waste in our 'domestic economy' lies in the fact that it is domestic.""[6]When Terry expresses that in the U.S. the majority of women stay home instead of ""working,"" the women wonder what he means by saying the women do not ""work.""—is caring for children not considered work?[7]

Though Gilman's ideas aim to help empower women in the workplace, the ideas of separatist feminism also extend into a perpetuation ofwhite feminism—a branch of feminism that continually neglects the unique issues ofwomen of color. Gilman's talk of eugenics, racial purity, and ""servants"" all hint at system of white supremacy where the different struggles of working-class women of color are not addressed.[8]

Additionally, in an effort to subvert the male-dominated system, Gilman inadvertently transcends this male subjugation into a different form—Lynne Evans states that the over emphasis on children invokes a subjugating system similar to the patriarchy.[9]In a society that bans abortion and centers all aspects of social, economic, and political life around the production of children, these ""Herlanders"" are still tied, without will, to their biological roles as mothers.

Deborah L Madsen argues that a Marxist feminist approach can enhance readers' understanding of Gilman's writing, observing that Gilman exposes ""the ideological construction of the self under patriarchy"" inHerlandby ""represent[ing] the world in a utopian fashion, as it should be rather than it is, with women in possession of equal rights and responsibilities and dignity that comes from realising their full human potential.”[10]

Following its publication inThe Forerunner, Herlandand its sequel,With Her in Ourland,were largely forgotten throughout the mid-20th Century. In 1968, the full run ofThe Forerunnerwas reprinted infacsimilebyGreenwood Reprintsas a part of theRadical Periodicals in the United States, 1890-1960series. However, it was not until the re-printing of Gilman's canonical short-story, ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" in 1973, that Gilman's work began receiving major scholarly attention.

In 1979,Herlandwas re-published as a stand-alone novel byPantheon Books, with a lengthy introduction by scholarAnn J. Laneplacing it within contemporary feminist discourses, and appended with the subtitle ""A Lost Feminist Utopian Novel."" Lane was also the first to suggest in her introduction a ""Utopian Trilogy"" of novels by Gilman, includingMoving the Mountain(1911),Herland, andWith Her in Ourland, all of which had been published serially inThe Forerunner.InThe Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction,David Pringlereferred toHerlandas ""an important feminist work, long forgotten, and recently published for the first time in bookform.""[11]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1056,Martin Eden,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Eden,"Living inOaklandat the beginning of the 20th century, Martin Eden struggles to rise above his destitute,proletariancircumstances through an intense and passionate pursuit of self-education, hoping to achieve a place among the literary elite. His principal motivation is his love for Ruth Morse. Because Eden is a rough, uneducated sailor from a working-class background[5]and the Morses are abourgeoisfamily, a union between them would be impossible unless and until he reached their level of wealth and refinement.

Over a period of two years, Eden promises Ruth that success will come, but just before it does, Ruth loses her patience and rejects him in a letter, saying, ""if only you had settled down ... and attempted to make something of yourself"". By the time Eden attains the favor of the publishers and the bourgeoisie who had shunned him, he has already developed a grudge against them and become jaded by toil and unrequited love. Instead of enjoying his success, he retreats into a quiet indifference, interrupted only to rail mentally against the gentility of bourgeois society or to donate his new wealth to working-class friends and family. He feels that people do not value him for himself or for his work but only for his fame.

A former sailor from a working-class background, who falls in love with the young, bourgeois Ruth and educates himself to become a writer, aiming to win her hand in marriage.

The young, bourgeois university student who captivates Eden while tutoring him in English. Though initially both attracted and repelled by his working-class background, she eventually realizes she loves him. They become engaged, with the condition that they cannot marry until her parents approve of his financial and social status.

Acanneryworker rejected by Eden, who is already in love with Ruth. Initially, while Eden strives for education and culture, Lizzie's rough hands make her seem inferior to Ruth in his eyes. Despite this, Lizzie remains devoted to him. He feels an attachment to her because she has always loved him for who he is, and not for fame or money, as Ruth does.

Eden's boss at the laundry, who wins Eden over with his cheeriness and capacity for work, but, like Eden, suffers from overwork. He quits the laundry and tries to convince Eden to adopt a hobo lifestyle. Toward the end of the book, Eden meets him again, and offers him a laundry. Joe, who likes thehobolife, except for the lack of girls, eventually accepts the offer and promises to treat the employees fairly.

A sickly writer who encourages Eden to give up writing and return to the sea before city life swallows him up. Brissenden is a committedsocialistand introduces Eden to a group of amateur philosophers he calls the ""real dirt"". His final work,Ephemera, causes a literary sensation when Eden breaks his word and publishes it upon Brissenden's death.

Social class, seen from Eden's point of view, is a very important theme in the novel. Eden is a sailor from a working-class background who feels uncomfortable but inspired when he meets the bourgeois Morse family. As he improves himself, he finds himself increasingly distanced from his working-class background and surroundings, becoming repelled by Lizzie's hands. Eventually, when Eden finds that his education has far surpassed that of the bourgeoisie he looked up to, he feels more isolated than ever.Paul Bermancomments that Eden cannot reconcile his ""civilized and clean"" self with the ""fistfighting barbarian"" of the past, and that this inability causes his descent into a delirious ambivalence.[6]

The word consciousness, or variations of it, shows up sixty-two times in the novel, making an appearance in the context of many theoretical discussions about the nature of human consciousness. Martin Eden embraces the concept of ""henidical mental processes"", coined byOtto Weiningerin his 1903 work,Geschlecht und Charakter.[7]

Although London was a socialist, he invested Eden with strong individualism. Eden comes from a working-class background but he seeks self-improvement rather than improvement for his class as a whole. QuotingNietzscheandHerbert Spencer, he rejects the ""slave morality"" of socialism, even at socialist meetings. London stresses that it is this individualism that leads to Eden's suicide."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8954,Lady Audley's Secret,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Audley%27s_Secret,"The novel opens in June 1857 with the marriage of Lucy Graham and Sir Michael Audley. Lucy is a young, beautiful woman who enchants almost all who meet her. Sir Michael is a kindly, wealthy middle-aged widower. Lucy's past is unclear. Prior to marrying Sir Michael she had served as governess for the children of the local doctor, Mr. Dawson, and before that she was in service with Mrs. Vincent. Very little is known about her prior to that. Shortly after the marriage Sir Michael's nephew, the barrister Robert Audley, welcomes his old friend George Talboys back to England.

Three years before, though happily married, George's financial situation had been desperate. He left for Australia to seek a fortune ingold prospecting. Behind him in England he had left his young wife Helen, whom he is now anxious to get news of. He reads in the newspaper that she has died, and, after visiting her home to confirm this, he becomes despondent. Robert Audley cares for his friend, and, hoping to distract him, offers to take him to his wealthy uncle's country manor. George had a child, Georgey, who was left under the care of Lieutenant Maldon, George's father-in-law. Robert and George set off to visit Georgey, and George decides to make Robert little Georgey's guardian and trustee of £20,000 put into the boy's name. After settling the matter of the boy's guardianship, the two set off to visit Sir Michael.

While at the country manor Audley Court, Lady Audley avoids meeting George. When the two seek an audience with the new Lady Audley, she makes many excuses and avoids their visits. During her absence a thunder storm confines George and Robert to the interior of Audley Court, and the two are shown a portrait of Lady Audley. Looking back toward his friend, Robert notes that George seems disturbed, and attributes his disturbed mood to the storm. Shortly thereafter George disappears. Robert is perplexed. Unwilling to believe George simply left with no notice, Robert begins to look into the circumstances of his disappearance.

While searching for his friend, Robert takes note of the events surrounding George's disappearance. The name of Lady Audley repeatedly appears in these notes, and much to his distress, the evidence begins to collect against her. One night, he reveals his notes to Lady Audley, including that George was in possession of many letters of his former wife. Lady Audley sets off to London, where the letters were kept. Robert follows after her. However, by the time he arrives, he discovers that George's possessions have been broken into and the letters are missing. One possession, however, remains – a book with a note written by George's wife that matches Lady Audley's handwriting. This confirms Robert's suspicion that Lady Audley is implicated in George's disappearance; it also leads Robert to conclude that Lady Audley is actually George's supposedly dead wife.

Suspecting the worst of Lady Audley and being afraid for little Georgey's life, Robert travels to Lieutenant Maldon's house and demands possession of the boy. Once Robert has Georgey under his control, he places the boy in a school run by Mr. Marchmont. Afterwards, Robert visits George's father, Mr. Harcourt Talboys, and confronts the Squire with his son's death. Harcourt listens dispassionately to the story. In the course of his visit to the Talboys' manor, Robert is entranced by George's sister Clara, who looks startlingly like George. Clara's passion for finding her brother spurs Robert on.

In February 1859, Robert continues searching for evidence. He receives a notice that his uncle is ill, and he quickly returns to Audley Court. While there, Robert speaks with Mr. Dawson and receives a brief description of all that is known about Lucy's background. He hears that Lucy was employed by Mrs. Vincent at her school since 1852. To verify this claim, Robert tracks down Mrs. Vincent, who is in hiding because of debts. According to Miss Tonks, a teacher at Mrs. Vincent's school, Lucy actually arrived at the school in August 1854 and was secretive about her past. Miss Tonks gives Robert a travel box that used to belong to Lucy. Upon examining stickers on the box, Robert discovers both the name Lucy Graham and the name Helen Talboys.

Robert realizes that Helen Talboys faked her death before creating her new identity. When Robert confronts Lucy, she tells him that he has no proof. He leaves to find more evidence, heading to Castle Inn, which is run by Luke Marks. During the night, Lucy forces Luke's wife, Phoebe, to let her into the inn, then Lucy sets the place afire to kill Robert. However, Robert survives and returns to Audley Court and again confronts Lucy. This time, she says she is insane and confesses her life's story to Robert and Sir Michael, claiming that George abandoned her originally and she had no choice but to abandon her old life and child to find another, wealthier husband.

Sir Michael is unhappy and leaves with Alicia to travel through Europe. Robert invites a Dr. Mosgrave to make a more astute judgment regarding Lucy's sanity, and he proclaims that she is indeed victim to latent insanity, which overpowers her in times of stress and makes her very dangerous to any and all. Lucy, under the name of Madame Taylor, enters a mental institution located somewhere in Belgium along the route between Brussels and Paris. While being committed, Lucy confesses to Robert that she killed George by pushing him down a deserted well in the garden of Audley Court.

Robert grieves for his friend George until a dying Luke Marks contacts him. Before succumbing to injuries he suffered in the fire, Luke tells Robert that George survived Lady Audley's attempted murder. Luke then helped George escape, with George intending to return to Australia. Robert is overjoyed, and he asks Clara to marry him and go with him to Australia to find George. Clara accepts, but before they set out, George returns and reveals that he actually visited New York instead. The narrative ends with the death of Lucy abroad, and Clara and Robert happily married and living in a country cottage with George and his son. Robert's formerly infatuated cousin Alicia marries her once-spurned suitor, Sir Harry Towers, and Audley Court is left abandoned along with all of its unhappy memories.

Lady Audley's Secretplays onVictoriananxieties about thedomestic sphere. The home was supposed to be a refuge from the dangers of the outside world, but in the novel, the seemingly perfect domestic lady turns out to be a violent criminal who has not only tried to commit murder but who has also committed bigamy and abandoned her child. This unsettled Victorian readers because it indicated that the concepts of ""the perfect lady/mother"" and ""domestic bliss"" were more idealistic than realistic. In addition, anxieties about the increasing urbanization of Britain abound; the city gives Lady Audley the power to change her identity because it renders its citizens effectively anonymous. The small town of Audley is no longer a refuge where everyone knows the life story of every neighbor; the residents of Audley must accept Lucy Graham's account of herself since they have no other information about her past. Other anxieties about unstable identity appear throughout the novel: Lady Audley's maid, Phoebe, resembles Lady Audley, thus banishing the idea of physical distinction between the upper and lower classes and therefore of any inherent superiority of the former.

Lady Audley's Secretis, furthermore, a story about gender and class, and Lady Audley's objectionable upward mobility suggests a threat to the paradigm of social class. Madness is also a key issue. Lady Audley and others often converse about the meaning of this word, but many readers believe that Lady Audley is not mad. In fact, many critics view Lady Audley's deception as a feminist act in which a woman takes control of the direction of her own life.[7]

The novel mirrors many of the same themes from the real-lifeConstance Kent caseof June 1860.[4]The first instalment ofLady Audley's Secretcame out almost exactly one year after the Kent murder.[4]The novel, like the real-life case, featured a stepmother and former governess, a mysterious and brutal murder in a country manor house, a body thrown down a well, and characters fascinated by madness.[4]Constance Kent can be seen in many of the female characters in the novel: the murderess Lady Audley, the tomboyish Alicia Audley, the restrained Phoebe Marks and the lonely Clara Talboys.[4]Jack Whicher, the detective and case investigator, can be seen in the character of Robert Audley.[4]

Lady Audley's Secretis involved in a subplot ofBetsy and Tacy Go Downtown, the fourth book in theBetsy-Tacyseries byMaud Hart Lovelace. Betsy has read it and other books in the same genre, and aspires to write similar works.

In theAgatha Christieshort story ""Greenshaw's Folly"", Miss Greenshaw hides her will in a copy ofLady Audley's Secret, remarking it was a ""best-seller in its day""."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/82,Ivanhoe: A Romance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe,"Ivanhoeis the story of one of the remainingAnglo-Saxonnoble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelminglyNorman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for Sir Wilfred's allegiance to the Norman kingRichard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of theThird Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured byLeopold of Austriaon his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.

Protagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, a ward of Cedric and descendant of the Saxon Kings of England. Cedric planned to have Rowena marry the powerful Lord Athelstane, apretenderto the Crown of England by his descent from the last Saxon King,Harold Godwinson. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on theThird Crusade, where he is said to have played a notable role in theSiege of Acre.

The book opens with a scene of Norman knights andprelatesseeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by apilgrim, known at that time as apalmer. That same night, Isaac ofYork, a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood on his way to the tournament at Ashby. Following the night's meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, theTemplarBrian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to hisSaracensoldiers to capture Isaac.

The palmer then assists in Isaac's escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of theswineherdGurth.

Isaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and awar horseto participate in thetournamentatAshby-de-la-ZouchCastle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight. The palmer is taken by surprise, but accepts the offer.

The tournament is presided over byPrince John. Also in attendance are Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca,Robin of Locksleyand his men, Prince John's advisor Waldemar Fitzurse, and numerous Normanknights.

On the first day of the tournament, in a bout of individualjousting, a mysterious knight, identifying himself only as ""Desdichado"" (described in the book as Spanish, taken by the Saxons to mean ""Disinherited""), defeats Bois-Guilbert. The masked knight declines to reveal himself despite Prince John's request, but is nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose the Queen of the Tournament. He bestows this honour upon Lady Rowena.

On the second day, at amelee, Desdichado is the leader of one party, opposed by his former adversaries. Desdichado's side is soon hard-pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes until rescued by a knight nicknamedLe Noir Faineant('the Black Sluggard'), who thereafter departs in secret. When forced to unmask himself to receive hiscoronet(the sign of championship), Desdichado is identified as Wilfred of Ivanhoe, returned from the Crusades. This causes much consternation to Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King Richard.

Ivanhoe is severely wounded in the competition yet his father does not move quickly to tend to him. Instead, Rebecca, a skilledphysician, tends to him while they are lodged near the tournament and then convinces her father to take Ivanhoe with them to their home in York when he is fit for that trip. The conclusion of the tournament includes feats of archery by Locksley, such as splitting a willow reed with his arrow. Prince John's dinner for the local Saxons ends in insults.

In the forests between Ashby and York, Isaac, Rebecca and the wounded Ivanhoe are abandoned by their guards, who fear bandits and take all of Isaac's horses. Cedric, Athelstane and the Lady Rowena meet them and agree to travel together. The party is captured by de Bracy and his companions and taken to Torquilstone, the castle of Front-de-Bœuf. The swineherd Gurth and Wamba the jester manage to escape, and then encounter Locksley, who plans a rescue.

The Black Knight, having taken refuge for the night in the hut oflocal friar, the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, volunteers his assistance on learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley. They then besiege the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin's own men, including the friar and assorted Saxonyeomen. Inside Torquilstone, de Bracy expresses his love for the Lady Rowena but is refused. Brian de Bois-Guilbert tries to rape Rebecca and is thwarted. He then tries to seduce her and is rebuffed. Front-de-Bœuf tries to wring a hefty ransom from Isaac of York, but Isaac refuses to pay unless his daughter is freed.

When the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives, their Norman captors demand a priest to administer theFinal Sacramentto Cedric; whereupon Cedric'sjesterWamba slips in disguised as a priest, and takes the place of Cedric, who escapes and brings important information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its layout. On his way out, Cedric meets the Saxon crone Ulrica, who vows revenge on Front-de-Bœuf and advises Cedric to tell the besiegers. The besiegers storm the castle. The castle is set aflame during the assault by Ulrica, the daughter of the original lord of the castle, Lord Torquilstone, as revenge for her father's death. Front-de-Bœuf is killed in the fire while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight, who identifies himself as King Richard and releases de Bracy. Bois-Guilbert escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is captured by the Clerk of Copmanhurst. The Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric, while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is rescued from the burning castle by King Richard. In the fighting, Athelstane is wounded and presumed dead while attempting to rescue Rebecca, whom he mistakes for Rowena.

Following the battle, Locksley plays host to King Richard. Word is conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King's return and the fall of Torquilstone. In the meantime, Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive to the nearest Templar Preceptory, where Lucas de Beaumanoir, theGrand Master of the Templars, takes umbrage at Bois-Guilbert's infatuation and subjects Rebecca to a trial for witchcraft. At Bois-Guilbert's secret request, she claims the right totrial by combat; and Bois-Guilbert, who had hoped to fight as Rebecca's champion, is devastated when the Grand Master orders him to fight on behalf of the Templestowe. Rebecca then writes to her father to procure a champion for her. Cedric organizes Athelstane's funeral atConingsburgh, in the midst of which the Black Knight arrives with Ivanhoe. Cedric, who had not been present at Locksley's carousal, is ill-disposed towards the knight upon learning his true identity, but Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him with his son. During this conversation, Athelstane emerges—not dead, but laid in his coffin alive by monks desirous of the funeral money. Over Cedric's renewed protests, Athelstane pledges his homage to the Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to allow Rowena to marry Ivanhoe, to which Cedric finally agrees.

Soon after this reconciliation, Ivanhoe receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca's behalf. Ivanhoe, riding day and night, arrives in time for the trial by combat; however, both horse and man are exhausted, with little chance of victory. Bois-Guilbert refuses to fight but Ivanhoe accuses him of breaking his word and the Templar reacts fiercely. His face becomes flushed and he is ready for combat. The two knights make one charge at each other with lances, Bois-Guilbert appearing to have the advantage. Ivanhoe and his horse go down, but Bois-Guilbert also falls though barely touched. Ivanhoe quickly gets up to finish the fight with his sword, but Bois-Guilbert does not rise and dies a victim of his own contending passions.

Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together. Fearing further persecution, Rebecca and her father plan to quit England forGranada. Before leaving, Rebecca comes to Rowena shortly after the wedding to bid her a solemn farewell. Ivanhoe's military service ends with the death of King Richard five years later.

Dedicatory Epistle: An imaginary letter to the Rev. Dr Dryasdust from Laurence Templeton who has found the materials for the following tale mostly in the Anglo-Norman Wardour Manuscript.

Critics of the novel have treated it as a romance intended mainly to entertain boys.[7]Ivanhoemaintains many of the elements of theRomance genre, including the quest, a chivalric setting, and the overthrowing of a corrupt social order to bring on a time of happiness.[8]Other critics assert that the novel creates a realistic and vibrant story, idealising neither the past nor its main character.[7][8]

Scott treats themes similar to those of some of his earlier novels, likeRob RoyandThe Heart of Midlothian, examining the conflict between heroic ideals and modern society. In the latter novels, industrial society becomes the centre of this conflict as the ""backward"" Scots and the ""advanced"" English have to arise from chaos to create unity. Similarly, the Normans inIvanhoe, who represent a more sophisticated culture, and the Saxons, who are poor, disenfranchised, and resentful of Norman rule, band together and begin to mould themselves into one people. The conflict between the Saxons and Normans focuses on the losses both groups must experience before they can be reconciled and thus forge a united England. The particular loss is in the extremes of their own cultural values, which must be disavowed in order for the society to function. For the Saxons, this value is the final admission of the hopelessness of the Saxon cause. The Normans must learn to overcome the materialism and violence in their own codes ofchivalry. Ivanhoe and Richard represent the hope of reconciliation for a unified future.[7]

Ivanhoe, though of a more noble lineage than some of the other characters, represents a middling individual in the medieval class system who is not exceptionally outstanding in his abilities, as is expected of other quasi-historical fictional characters, such as theGreek heroes. CriticGyörgy Lukácspoints to middling main characters like Ivanhoe in Walter Scott's other novels as one of the primary reasons Scott's historical novels depart from previous historical works, and better explore social and cultural history.[9]

The location of the novel is centred upon southernYorkshire, north-westLeicestershireand northernNottinghamshirein England. Castles mentioned within the story includeAshby de la Zouch Castle(now a ruin in the care ofEnglish Heritage), York (though the mention ofClifford's Tower, likewise an extant English Heritage property, isanachronistic, it not having been called that until later after various rebuilds) and 'Coningsburgh', which is based uponConisbrough Castle, in the ancient town ofConisbroughnearDoncaster(the castle also being a popular English Heritage site). In the novel, Aymer is the Prior of Jorvaulx, a historical spelling of the greatJervaulx AbbeyofYorkshire. Reference is made within the story toYork Minster, where the climactic wedding takes place, and to the Bishop of Sheffield, although theDiocese of Sheffielddid not exist at either the time of the novel or the time Scott wrote the novel and was not founded until 1914. Such references suggest that Robin Hood lived or travelled in the region.

Conisbrough is so dedicated to the story ofIvanhoethat many of its streets, schools, and public buildings are named after characters from the book.

Sir Walter Scott took the title of his novel, the name of its hero, from the Buckinghamshire village ofIvinghoe.
""The name of Ivanhoe,"" he says in his 1830 Introduction to the Magnum edition, ""was suggested by an old rhyme.

Ivanhoe is an alternate name for Ivinghoe first recorded in 1665.[10]

Older rural people in the Ivinghoe area most probably pronounced the name the same as Ivanhoe, according to Prof. Paul Kerswill of the University of York, a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).[11]

It is most probable Scott had direct knowledge of Ivinghoe and did some research before using it as the title for his novel, as he did for the other places mentioned in the novel.

The presence of Sir Walter Scott was recorded in Berkhamsted that is just eight miles away from Ivinghoe.[12]In the novel he speaks also of ""the rich fief of Ivanhoe"". The Manor of Ivanhoe is listed in the largest 20% of settlements recorded inDomesday.[13]

The modern conception of Robin Hood as a cheerful, decent, patriotic rebel owes much toIvanhoe.

""Locksley"" becomes Robin Hood's title in the Scott novel, and it has been used ever since to refer to the legendaryoutlaw. Scott appears to have taken the name from an anonymousmanuscript—written in 1600—that employs ""Locksley"" as an epithet for Robin Hood. Owing to Scott's decision to make use of the manuscript, Robin Hood from Locksley has been transformed for all time into ""Robin of Locksley"", alias Robin Hood. (There is, incidentally, a village calledLoxleyin Yorkshire.)

Scott makes the 12th-century's Saxon-Norman conflict a major theme in his novel. The original medieval stories about Robin Hood did not mention any conflict between Saxons and Normans; it was Scott who introduced this theme into the legend.[14]The characters inIvanhoerefer to Prince John and King Richard I as ""Normans""; contemporary medieval documents from this period do not refer to either of these two rulers as Normans.[14]Recent re-tellings of the story retain Scott's emphasis on the Norman-Saxon conflict.

Scott also shunned the late-16th-century depiction of Robin as a dispossessed nobleman (the Earl of Huntingdon).

This, however, has not prevented Scott from making an important contribution to the noble-hero strand of the legend, too, because some subsequent motion picture treatments of Robin Hood's adventures give Robin traits that are characteristic of Ivanhoe as well. The most notable Robin Hood films are the lavishDouglas Fairbanks1922 silent film, the 1938 triple Academy Award-winningAdventures of Robin HoodwithErrol Flynnas Robin (which contemporary reviewerFrank Nugentlinks specifically withIvanhoe[15]), and the 1991 box-office successRobin Hood: Prince of ThieveswithKevin Costner. There is also theMel BrooksspoofRobin Hood: Men in Tights.

In most versions of Robin Hood, both Ivanhoe and Robin, for instance, are returning Crusaders. They have quarrelled with their respective fathers, they are proud to be Saxons, they display a highly evolved sense of justice, they support the rightful king even though he is of Norman-French ancestry, they are adept with weapons, and they each fall in love with a ""fair maid"" (Rowena and Marian, respectively).

This particular time-frame was popularised by Scott. He borrowed it from the writings of the 16th-century chroniclerJohn Mairor a 17th-centuryballadpresumably to make the plot of his novel more gripping. Medieval balladeers had generally placed Robin about two centuries later in the reign ofEdward I,IIorIII.

Robin's familiar feat of splitting his competitor's arrow in an archery contest appears for the first time inIvanhoe.

The general political events depicted in the novel are fairly accurate; the novel tells of the period just after King Richard's imprisonment in Austria following the Crusade and of his return to England after a ransom is paid. Yet the story is also heavily fictionalised. Scott himself acknowledged that he had taken liberties with history in his ""Dedicatory Epistle"" toIvanhoe. Modern readers are cautioned to understand that Scott's aim was to create a compelling novel set in a historical period, not to provide a book of history.[16]

There has been criticism of Scott's portrayal of the bitter extent of the ""enmity of Saxon and Norman, represented as persisting in the days of Richard"" as ""unsupported by the evidence of contemporary records that forms the basis of the story.""[17]HistorianE. A. Freemancriticised Scott's novel, stating its depiction of a Saxon–Norman conflict in late twelfth-century England was unhistorical. Freeman cited medieval writerWalter Map, who claimed that tension between the Saxons and Normans had declined by the reign ofHenry I.[18]Freeman also cited the late twelfth-century bookDialogus de ScaccariobyRichard FitzNeal. This book claimed that the Saxons and Normans had so merged throughintermarriageandcultural assimilationthat (outside the aristocracy) it was impossible to tell ""one from the other.""[18][19]Finally, Freeman ended his critique of Scott by saying that by the end of the twelfth century, the descendants of both Saxons and Normans in England referred to themselves as ""English"", not ""Saxon"" or ""Norman"".[18][19][20]

However, Scott may have intended to suggest parallels between theNorman Conquest, which takes place roughly 130 years before the setting ofIvanhoe, and Scott's native Scotland, which hadunited with England in 1707roughly the same length of time ago, and witnessed a resurgence inScottish nationalismevidenced by the emergence ofRobert Burns, the famous poet who deliberately chose to work in Scots vernacular though he was an educated man and spoke modern English eloquently.[21]Some experts suggest that Scott deliberately usedIvanhoeto illustrate his own combination of Scottish patriotism andunionism.[22][23]

The novel generated a new name in English—Cedric. The original Saxon name had beenCerdicbut Scott misspelled it—an example ofmetathesis. ""It is not a name but a misspelling"" said satiristH. H. Munro.[citation needed]

In England in 1194, it would have been anachronistic for Rebecca, a Jewish woman, to be charged withwitchcraft. In medieval witch trials, it was usually the belief in witchcraft that was prosecuted as a heresy, a charge a non-Christian woman would not have been subject to. Death did not become the usual penalty until the 15th century and even then, the form of execution used for witches in England was hanging, notburning. The conductor of the trial, the Grand Master Of The Templars, is referred to as Lucas de Beaumanoir, whereas the historically real Master during that time wasGilbert Horal. There are other various minor errors, e.g. the description of the tournament at Ashby owes more to the 14th century, most of the coins mentioned by Scott are exotic,William Rufusis said to have been John Lackland's grandfather, but he was actually his great-great-uncle, and Wamba (disguised as a monk) says ""I am a poor brother of the Order of St Francis"", butSt. Francis of Assisionly began his preaching ten years after the death of Richard I. Also, in Chapter 43, Bois-Guilbert commences the fight being mounted on his horse named Zamor, which he claimed that he had won from the ""Soldan of Trebizond"". This is anachronistic, as the Comnenids founded the rumpByzantineEmpire of Trebizondonly in 1204, just by the end of theFourth Crusade. Lastly, in the novel's ultimate chapter, Rebecca and her father move to Granada to spend the rest of their lives under Mohammed Boabdil. In fact, the realMuhammad XII of Granada, popularly known to the Western world as Boabdil, was not even born before 1460, and theEmirate of Granadaestablished before 1230.

Despite this fancifulness,Ivanhoedoes make some prescient historical points. The novel is occasionally critical of King Richard, ""who seems to love adventure more than he loves the well-being of his subjects""—in contrast to the idealised, romantic view of Richard popular at the time, but rather echoes the way King Richard is often judged by historians today.[24]

Most of the original reviewers gaveIvanhoean enthusiastic or broadly favourable reception.[25]As usual, Scott's descriptive powers and his ability to present the matters of the past were generally praised. More than one reviewer found the work notably poetic. Several of them found themselves transported imaginatively to the remote period of the novel, although some problems were recognised: the combining of features from the high and late Middle Ages; an awkwardly created language for the dialogue; and antiquarian overload. The author's excursion into England was generally judged a success, the forest outlaws and the creation of 'merry England' attracting particular praise. Rebecca was almost unanimously admired, especially in her farewell scene. The plot was either criticised for its weakness, or just regarded as of less importance than the scenes and characters. The scenes at Torquilstone were judged horrible by several critics, with special focus on Ulrica. Athelstane's resurrection found no favour, the kindest response being that of Francis Jeffrey inThe Edinburgh Reviewwho suggested (writing anonymously, like all the reviewers) that it was 'introduced out of the very wantonness of merriment'.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon, who was a devotee of Scott's, wrote a poetical illustration to a picture ofThe Tournament. byThomas Allomin Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838.[26]

TheEglinton Tournament of 1839held bythe 13th Earl of EglintonatEglinton Castlein Ayrshire was inspired by and modelled onIvanhoe.

On 5 November 2019,BBC NewsincludedIvanhoeon its list of the100 most influential novels.[27]

The novel has been the basis for several motion pictures:

There have also been many television adaptations of the novel, including:

Victor Sieg's dramaticcantataIvanhoéwon thePrix de Romein 1864 and premiered in Paris the same year.Ivanhoewas thegrand operabyArthur SullivanandJulian Sturgis(Sturgis was recommended by Sullivan's oft-time partnerW. S. Gilbert). It debuted in 1891, and ran for 155 consecutive performances.[33]Other operas based on the novel have been composed byGioachino Rossini(Ivanhoé),Thomas Sari(Ivanhoé),Bartolomeo Pisani(Rebecca),A. Castagnier(Rébecca),Otto Nicolai(Il Templario), andHeinrich Marschner(Der Templer und die Jüdin). Rossini's opera is apasticcio(an opera in which the music for a new text is chosen from pre-existent music by one or more composers). Scott attended a performance of it and recorded inhis journal, ""It was an opera, and, of course, the story sadly mangled and the dialogue, in part nonsense.""[34]

The railway running throughAshby-de-la-Zouchwas known as theIvanhoe linebetween 1993 and 2005, in reference to the book's setting in the locality.

A portion of theSilver Lakeneighborhood in Los Angeles was established in 1887 as a real estate tract called Ivanhoe. (Realtors John C. Byram and Robert W. Poindexter were behind the tract; it is a myth that it was named decades earlier by Scottish settler Hugo Reid, as he never lived in this section of Los Angeles County.) The upper reservoir and an elementary school are still named Ivanhoe while many of the streets in the area reference Scott's other works and characters such as Locksley, Rowena, Kenilworth, Waverly [sic], Avenel, and St. George.[35]

Ivanhoe, North Carolinais named afterIvanhoe.[36]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland,"Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots aWhite Rabbitwith apocket watchandwaistcoatlamenting that he is late. Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing. Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden. While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled ""Drink me"". Alice drinks some of the bottle's contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door. However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it. Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled ""Eat me"", which causes her to grow to a tremendous size. Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves. Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears. Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a ""Caucus Race"" to dry themselves. Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.

The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan. Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them. Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house. Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes. Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest. She meets aCaterpillarseated on a mushroom and smoking ahookah. During the Caterpillar's questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded byher inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice's neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of aDuchess, who owns a perpetually grinningCheshire Cat. The Duchess's baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods. The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward theHatterandMarch Harebefore disappearing, leaving his grin behind. Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepyDormousein the midst of atea party. The Hatter explains that it is always 6 p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to ""kill it"". A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing desk?"" is brought up. Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.

Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey. She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be thecroquetcourt of theQueen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards. Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops. The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings. When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter. When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.

Alice then meets aGryphonand aMock Turtle, who dance to theLobster Quadrillewhile Alice recites (rather incorrectly)a poem. The Mock Turtle sings them ""Beautiful Soup"", during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which theKnave of Heartsstands accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The trial is conducted by theKing of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met. Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice's beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen's guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself."

Some time later, their son John Clayton II[3]is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king apeKerchak. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape widowKala, who lost her previous son after dropping it from a treetop while being chased by Kerchak.

Clayton is named ""Tarzan"" (""White Skin"" in theape language) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.

As a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having ""never heard it, cannot speak it.""

Upon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a hugegorillawhich he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as ""king"" of the apes.

Later, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them.  They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.

A few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year oldJane Porter, the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.  Tarzan's cousin,William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.

Among the party is French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While Tarzan is rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men.  In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.

Ultimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane inWisconsin, USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.[4]

Burroughs drifted across the United States until he was thirty-six, holding seventeen consecutive careers before he published stories.[5]He worked as a U.S. cavalryman, a gold miner in Oregon, a cowboy in Idaho, a railroad policeman in Salt Lake City, and an owner of several failed businesses.[6]He decided to write his own pulp fiction after being disappointed by the reading material others offered, and worked in that capacity for four years before his first novel,Tarzan of the Apes,was published.[6][7]Tarzan first appeared inThe All-Storyin October 1912.The All-Storypublished it in its entirety in installments, and it was published in 1914 as a novel.[1]

ThoughThe Jungle Bookis sometimes cited as an influence on Burroughs'Tarzan of the Apes, he claimed that his only inspiration was the Roman myth ofRomulus and Remus.[7]Rudyard Kiplingcommented that Burroughs ""had 'jazzed' the motif of the Jungle Books and, I imagine, thoroughly enjoyed himself.""[8]

Recentliterary criticismoften focuses on the identity of the eponymous protagonist ofTarzan of the Apes.Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklopčić, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan's heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan's escapist appeal.

Burroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in aWriter’s Digest,""I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive"".[9]

The scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents’ cabin and the objects which he finds there.[10]He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him.[10]Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills.  When he refuses to eat the African,  Burroughs portrays ""hereditary instinct"" as the reason.[11]Tarzan's genetic association with upper-class, Western civilization conditions his actions more than his violent environment,[12]and Berglund claims that Tarzan could represent the stereotypical ""scion of English stock"" in colonialized countries.[13]His racial superiority manifests itself through his behavior because it correlates with the ideals ofWestern civilization, whether he treats a woman politely or cannot force himself to eat an African man.[13]

Biljana Oklopčić emphasizes the portrayal of race inTarzan of the Apes. She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the ""black rapist"" stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of Sub-Saharan African descent.[14]

Catherine Jurca similarly analyzes Tarzan as opposed to tolerating the presence of people of other races and classes in favor of preserving his own culture. The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents’ home, from the ""savages"" who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.[15]

Though Burroughs' admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote thatTarzanis the story of the ""whiteman's conquest of black savagery"", where the native Sub-Saharan Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.[16]

Tarzan's jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan's ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs' portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan's growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.[17]

However, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, ""[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable"" in the novel.[18]Humans mistake apes for other humans,[19]an ape tries to rape Jane,[20]Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape,[19]and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion.[21]Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans.[22]For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies “queer ethics,” encouraging “perverse sexuality” along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.[23]

Most of the stories that Burroughs wrote were stories that he told himself.[6]According to Gore Vidal, when Burroughs was unsatisfied with reality, ""he consoled himself with an inner world where he was strong and handsome, adored by beautiful women and worshipped by exotic races.""[6]The story served for the most part as a form of masculine escape that inspired men and boys.[7]The adventurous character of Tarzan also appealed to wider American audiences over decades as a powerful means of escaping the sense of boredom and frustration which accompanies a confining society,[24]and to the twentieth-century American desire to reconquer a home that seemed lost.[15]""In the eyes of contemporary man, huddled in large cities and frustrated by a restrictive civilization, Tarzan was a joyous symbol of primitivism, an affirmation of life, endowing the reader with a Promethean sense of power.""[7]

Burroughs' novel has been the basis of several films. The first two were the silent filmsTarzan of the Apes(1918) andThe Romance of Tarzan(1918), both starringElmo Lincolnas Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation wasTarzan the Ape Man(1932), starringJohnny Weissmuller, who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced byHarry Holt(the character in the films). It was remade twice, asTarzan, the Ape Man(1959), featuring Denny Miller, andTarzan, the Ape Man(1981), withMiles O'Keeffeas Tarzan andBo Derekas Jane.

The 1935 12-part serial,The New Adventures of Tarzan, starred Herman Brix (later, ""Bruce Bennett""). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.

Four more movie adaptations have been made to date:Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes(1984), a film starringChristopher Lambertthat is more faithful to the book;Tarzan of the Apes(1999), a direct-to-video animated film;Tarzan(1999), a Disney animated film withTony Goldwynas the voice of Tarzan; andThe Legend of Tarzan(2016), a more historically contextualized update starringAlexander SkarsgårdandMargot Robbie, as well asChristoph WaltzandSamuel L. Jackson, portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian CaptainLéon Romand American Civil War soldierGeorge Washington Williams, respectively.

A number of Burroughs' other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen.  Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.

The book has been adapted intocomicform on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzancomic stripandcomic books. The strip itself began withHal Foster's adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those ofGold Key ComicsinTarzanno. 155 (script byGaylord DuBois, art byRuss Manning), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969),DC ComicsinTarzannos. 207-210, dated April–July 1972 (script and art byJoe Kubert), andMarvelinMarvel Super Specialno. 29, dated 1983 (reprinted inTarzan of the Apesnos. 1-2, dated July–August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and formerTarzancomic strip artistBurne Hogarth's 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novelTarzan of the Apes. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novelJungle Tales of Tarzan(1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs'identically titled collectionof Tarzan stories).Dynamite Entertainmentadapted the story for the first six issues ofLord of the Jungle, albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen."

The ship's owner, Morrel, will make Dantès the next captain. On his deathbed, Leclère charged Dantès to deliver a package toGeneral Bertrand(exiled withNapoleon), and a letter from Elba to a Bonapartist in Paris named Noirtier.

Crewmate Danglars is jealous of Dantès's rapid promotion. On the eve of Dantès's wedding to hisCatalanfiancée Mercédès, Danglars meets Fernand Mondego, Mercédès's cousin and a rival for her affections, and Mondego and Danglars hatch a plot to anonymously accuse him of being aBonapartist. Dantès's neighbor, Caderousse, is present; he too is jealous of Dantès, but although he objects to the plot, he becomes too drunk to prevent it.

On his wedding day, Dantès is arrested, but the cowardly Caderousse stays silent. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, is Noirtier's son. Knowing his political career would be destroyed if it is known that his father is a Bonapartist, he destroys the letter and silences Dantès by sentencing him without trial to life imprisonment.

After six years of solitary imprisonment in theChâteau d'If, Dantès is on the verge of suicide when another prisoner, the Abbé Faria, an Italian scholarly priest, digs an escape tunnel that mistakenly ends in Dantès's cell. The Abbé helps Dantès deduce the culprits of his imprisonment. Over the next eight years, Faria educates Dantès in languages, history, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death fromcatalepsyand having grown fond of his pupil, Faria tells Dantès the location of a vast treasure hidden on the island ofMonte Cristo.

On 28 February 1829, Faria dies. Dantès takes Faria's body to his cell and places himself in the burial sack. When he is thrown into the sea, Dantès cuts through the sack and swims to a nearby island, where, claiming to be a shipwrecked sailor, he is rescued byGenoesesmugglers. Some months later, he locates and retrieves the treasure; he later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title ofcountfrom theTuscangovernment.

Having sworn vengeance on Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort, Dantès returns to Marseille in search of information for his vengeance. Traveling as the Abbé Busoni, Dantès finds Caderousse, who regrets not intervening in Dantès's arrest. Caderousse informs him that Mercédès eventually resigned herself to marrying Fernand, that Dantès's father died of starvation, and that his old employer Morrel tried in vain to secure Dantès's release and tend after his father in his absence, but is now on the brink of bankruptcy. Both Danglars and Fernand have prospered greatly. Danglars became a speculator, amassed a fortune, married a wealthy widow, and became a baron. Fernand served in the French Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dantès rewards Caderousse with a diamond. Later, Caderousse negotiates the sale of the diamond to a jeweler, but kills the jeweler to keep the diamond and the money; he is eventually arrested andsentenced to the galleys.

To rescue Morrel from bankruptcy, Dantès poses as a banker, buys Morrel's debts, and gives him three months' reprieve. At the end of the three months, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that the debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dantès.

Dantès reappears nine years later, in 1838, as the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. Fernand is now the Count de Morcerf, Danglars a baron and banker, and Villefort aprocureur du roi('royal prosecutor').

In Rome, atCarnivaltime, Dantès befriendsViscountAlbert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Fernand. He arranges for Albert to be captured by thebanditLuigi Vampa, and ""rescues"" the boy, earning his trust. Albert introduces the Count to Parisianhigh society. Dantès, in his guise as the Count, meets Mercédès for the first time in 23 years, and eventually makes the acquaintance of Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

The Count purchases a home inAuteuil, a suburb of Paris. He has learned from his servant Bertuccio that it is the home in which Villefort once had an extramarital affair with Danglars's wife, who gave birth to a child that Villefort buried alive in order to cover up the affair. The infant was rescued by Bertuccio, named Benedetto, and raised by Bertuccio's sister Assunta, but Benedetto turned to a life of crime as a young man, murdered Assunta, and was sentenced to the galleys.

Having impressed Parisian society with his wealth and air of mystery, the Count begins setting up the pieces for his revenge. He persuades Danglars to extend him a credit of six million francs. He discusses the properties of various poisons with Villefort's second wife Heloïse, and allows her to borrow some of his supply. He allows his ward, Haydée—the exiled daughter ofAli Pasha of Janina, whom Dantès purchased from slavery—to see Fernand, recognizing him as the man who betrayed and murdered her father and stole his fortune. Having freed Benedetto and Caderousse from the galleys (under the alias ""Lord Wilmore""), he anonymously hires Benedetto to impersonate an Italian nobleman, ""Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti"", and introduces him to Parisian society. He manipulates the financial markets by bribing atelegraphoperator to transmit a false message, causing Danglars to lose hundreds of thousands of francs.

Meanwhile, Villefort's daughter Valentine is engaged to marry Albert's friend Franz, but is secretly in love with Morrel's son Maximilien; Noirtier, her grandfather, induces Franz to break the engagement by revealing that Noirtier himself killed Franz's father in a duel. Benedetto ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eugénie to him after canceling her engagement to Albert. Caderousse blackmails Benedetto, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. Heloïse begins poisoning members of Villefort's family, intending to ensure that all of the family's wealth will be inherited by her son Édouard, rather than her stepdaughter Valentine; Noirtier secretly begins dosing Valentine with a drug that will give her limited resistance to the poison.

Caderousse attempts to rob the Count's house but is caught by ""Abbé Busoni"" and forced to write a letter to Danglars, exposing ""Cavalcanti"" as an impostor. When Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Benedetto. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement naming his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse before he dies.

The Count anonymously leaks to the newspapers Fernand's betrayal of Ali Pasha, and at theChamber of Peers' inquiry into the accusations Haydée testifies against him as an eyewitness. Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to aduel. The Count is later visited by Mercédès, who had recognized him as Dantès upon their first meeting but chose not to say anything. Mercédès begs Dantès to spare her son. He tells her of the injustices inflicted on him, but agrees not to kill Albert. Realizing that Dantès intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, who makes a public apology to the Count. Albert and Mercédès disown Fernand, renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives. Albert enlists as a soldier, while Mercédès lives alone in Dantès's old house in Marseilles. Fernand confronts the Count of Monte Cristo, who reveals his identity. Fernand shoots himself.

At the party to celebrate ""Cavalcanti""'s engagement to Eugénie Danglars, the police arrive to arrest Benedetto for Caderousse's murder. Benedetto flees, but is arrested and returned to Paris. Eugénie (who is implied to be a lesbian[2][3]) also takes the opportunity to flee Paris with her girlfriend.

Valentine barely survives Héloïse's first attempt to poison her, and Maximilien begs the Count to protect her from the unknown poisoner. He does so by faking her death, making it appear that the poisoner succeeded. Villefort, deducing that Héloïse is the murderer, gives her a choice between the shame of a public trial and committing suicide in private, before leaving to prosecute Benedetto's trial. At the trial, Benedetto reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive, having learned the truth from Bertuccio. Villefort admits his guilt and rushes home to prevent his wife's suicide but is too late; she is dead and has poisoned her son Édouard as well. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, which drives Villefort insane. Dantès tries but fails toresuscitateÉdouard, causing him to question if his revenge has gone too far.

As a result of the Count's financial manipulations, Danglars is left with a ruined reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfill their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. He flees to Italy with the Count's receipt for the cash and 50,000 francs of his own, and is reimbursed the 5,000,000 francs from the Count's own bank account. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa. The bandits extort Danglars' ill-gotten gains out of him by forcing him to pay exorbitant prices for food and water; Dantès anonymously returns the money to the hospitals. Danglars finally repents of his crimes, and a softened Dantès forgives him and allows him to depart with his 50,000 francs.

Maximilien Morrel is driven to despair by Valentine's apparent death and considers suicide. Dantès reveals his true identity and persuades Maximilien to delay his suicide for one month. One month later, on the island of Monte Cristo, he reunites Valentine with Maximilien and reveals the true sequence of events. Having found peace, Dantès leaves the couple part of his fortune on the island and departs forthe Eastto begin a new life with Haydée, who has declared her love for him. The reader is left with a final line: ""l'humaine sagesse était tout entière dans ces deux mots: attendre et espérer!"" (""all human wisdom is contained in these two words: 'Wait and Hope'"").

A short novel titledGeorgesby Dumas was published in 1843, beforeThe Count of Monte Cristowas written. This novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas andplot devicesinThe Count of Monte Cristo.[5]

Dumas wrote that the germ of the idea of revenge as one theme in his novelThe Count of Monte Cristocame from an anecdote (Le Diamant et la Vengeance[6]) published in a memoir of incidents in France in 1838, written by an archivist of the Paris police.[7][8]The archivist wasJacques Peuchet, and the multi-volume book was calledMemoirs from the Archives of the Paris Policein English.[9]Dumas included this essay in one of the editions of his novel published in 1846.[10]

Peuchet related the tale of a shoemaker,Pierre Picaud, living inNîmesin 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy on behalf of England in a period of wars between France and England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in theFenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which the words ""Number One"" were printed, and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fiancée while Picaud was under arrest.[6]

In another of the true stories reported by Ashton-Wolfe, Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family.[10]This story is also mentioned in the Pléiade edition of this novel,[8]and it probably served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pléiade edition mentions other sources from real life:  a man namedAbbé Fariaexisted, was imprisoned but did not die in prison; he died in 1819 and left no large legacy to anyone.[8]As for Dantès, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet's book, since that model is murdered by the ""Caderousse"" of the plot.

The Count of Monte Cristowas originally published in theJournal des Débatsin eighteen parts. Serialization ran from 28 August 1844 to 15 January 1846. The first edition in book form was published in Paris byPétionin 18 volumes with the first two issued in 1844 and the remaining sixteen in 1845.[11]Most of the Belgian pirated editions, the first Paris edition and many others up to theLécrivain et Toubonillustrated edition of 1860 feature a misspelling of the title with ""Christo"" used instead of ""Cristo"". The first edition to feature the correct spelling was theL'Écho des Feuilletonsillustrated edition, Paris 1846. This edition featured plates byPaul GavarniandTony Johannotand was said to be ""revised"" and ""corrected"", although only the chapter structure appears to have been altered with an additional chapter entitledLa Maison des Allées de Meilhanhaving been created by splittingLe Départinto two.[12]

The first appearance ofThe Count of Monte Cristoin English was the first part of a serialization by W. Harrison Ainsworth in volume VII ofAinsworth's Magazinepublished in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitledThe Prisoner of If. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively.[12]Another abridged serialization appeared inThe London Journalbetween 1846 and 1847.

The first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitledThe Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo.[12]

In April 1846, volume three of theParlour Novelist, Belfast, Ireland: Simms and M'Intyre, London: W S Orr and Company, featured the first part of an unabridged translation of the novel by Emma Hardy. The remaining two parts would be issued as the Count of Monte Christo volumes I and II in volumes 8 and 9 of the Parlour Novelist respectively.[12]

The most common English translation is an anonymous one originally published in 1846 byChapman and Hall. This was originally released in ten weekly installments from March 1846 with six pages of letterpress and two illustrations by M Valentin.[13]The translation was released in book form with all twenty illustrations in two volumes in May 1846, a month after the release of the first part of the above-mentioned translation by Emma Hardy.[12]The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of ""Cristo"" and the extra chapterThe House on the Allées de Meilhan.

Most English editions of the novel follow the anonymous translation. In 1889, two of the major American publishersLittle BrownandT.Y. Crowellupdated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. This resulted in the removal of the chapterThe House on the Allées de Meilhan, with the text restored to the end of the chapter calledThe Departure.[14][15]

In 1955,Collinspublished an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitledThe Past, and renamed others.[16]This abridgment was republished by many Collins imprints and other publishers including theModern Library,Vintage, and the 1998Oxford World's Classicsedition (later editions restored the text). In 2008 Oxford released a revised edition with translation by David Coward. The 2009Everyman's Libraryedition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco.

In 1996,Penguin Classicspublished a new translation by Robin Buss. Buss' translation updated the language, making the text more accessible to modern readers, and restored content that was modified in the 1846 translation because of Victorian English social restrictions (for example, references to Eugénie's lesbian traits and behavior) to reflect Dumas' original version.

In addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese).[12]A more recent abridgment is the translation by Lowell Bair forBantam Classicsin 1956.

Many abridged translations omit the Count's enthusiasm forhashish. When serving a hashish jam to the young Frenchman Franz d'Épinay, the Count (calling himselfSinbad the Sailor), calls it, ""nothing less than the ambrosia whichHebeserved at the table of Jupiter"". When he arrives in Paris, the Count brandishes an emerald box in which he carries small green pills compounded of hashish and opium which he uses for sleeplessness. (Source: Chapters 31, 32, 38, 40, 53 & 77 in the 117-chapter unabridgedPocket Booksedition.) Dumas was a member of theClub des Hashischins.

In June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.[17]

The first Japanese translation byKuroiwa Shūrokuwas entitled ""Shigai Shiden Gankutsu-ou"" (史外史伝巌窟王, ""a historical story from outside history, the King of the Cavern""), and serialized from 1901 to 1902 in the Yorozu Chouhou newspaper, and released in book form in four volumes by publisher Aoki Suusandou in 1905. Though later translations use the title ""Monte Cristo-haku"" (モンテ・クリスト伯, the Count of Monte Cristo), the ""Gankutsu-ou"" title remains highly associated with the novel and is often used as an alternative. As of March 2016, all movie adaptations of the novel brought to Japan used the title ""Gankutsu-ou"", with the exception of the 2002 film, which has it as a subtitle (with the title itself simply being ""Monte Cristo"").

The novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novelsMeiji Gankutsu-ouby Taijirou Murasame andShin Gankutsu-oubyKaitarō Hasegawa. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the ""Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident"" (吉田岩窟王事件).

A manga adaptation of the novel, titledMonte Cristo Hakushaku(モンテ・クリスト, 伯爵) and made by Ena Moriyama, was published in November 2015.

The first translation into Chinese was published in 1907. The novel had been a personal favorite ofJiang Qing, and the 1978 translation became one of the first mass-popularized foreign novels in mainland China after end of theCultural Revolution. Since then, there have been another 22 Chinese translations.

The original work was published in serial form in theJournal des Débatsin 1844. Carlos Javier Villafane Mercado described the effect in Europe:

George Saintsburystated that ""Monte Cristois said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe. Perhaps no novel within a given number of years had so many readers and penetrated into so many different countries.""[19]This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was ""translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it ... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name 'Monte Cristo' into their titles.""[18]The titleMonte Cristolives on in a ""famous gold mine, a line of luxury Cuban cigars,a sandwich, and any number of bars and casinos—it even lurks in the name of the street-corner hustlethree-card monte.""[20]

Modern Russian writer and philologist Vadim Nikolayev determinedThe Count of Monte-Cristoas amegapolyphonicnovel.[21]

The novel has been the inspiration for many other books, fromLew Wallace'sBen-Hur(1880),[22]then to a science fiction retelling inAlfred Bester'sThe Stars My Destination,[23]and toStephen Fry'sThe Stars' Tennis Balls(entitledRevengein the U.S.).[24]

Fantasy novelistSteven Brust'sKhaavren Romancesseries have all used Dumas novels (particularly theThree Musketeersseries) as their chief inspiration, recasting the plots of those novels to fit within Brust's established world ofDragaera.[25]His 2020 novelThe Baron of Magister Valleyfollows suit, usingThe Count of Monte Cristoas a starting point.[26][27]Jin Yonghas admitted some influence from Dumas, his favorite non-Chinese novelist.[28]Some commentators feel that the plot ofA Deadly SecretresemblesThe Count of Monte Cristo, except that they are based in different countries and historical periods.

The success ofThe Count of Monte Cristocoincides with France'sSecond Empire. In the novel, Dumas tells of the 1815 return ofNapoleon I, and alludes to contemporary events when the governor at theChâteau d'Ifis promoted to a position at the castle of Ham.[8][Notes 1]The attitude of Dumas towards ""bonapartisme"" was conflicted. His father,Thomas-Alexandre Dumas,[Notes 2]a Haitian ofmixed descent, became a successful general during theFrench Revolution.  In 1840, the body of Napoleon Iwas brought to Franceand became an object of veneration in the church ofLes Invalides, renewing popular patriotic support for the Bonaparte family. As the story opens, the character Dantès is not aware of the politics, considers himself simply a good French citizen, and is caught between the conflicting loyalties of the royalist Villefort during the Restoration, and the father of Villefort, Noirtier, loyal to Napoleon, a firm bonapartist, and the bonapartist loyalty of his late captain, in a period of rapid changes of government in France.

In ""Causeries"" (1860), Dumas published a short paper, ""État civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo"", on the genesis of the Count ofMonte Cristo.[8][Notes 3]It appears that Dumas had close contacts with members of the Bonaparte family while living in Florence in 1841. In a small boat, he sailed around the island of Monte Cristo, accompanied by a young prince, a cousin to Louis Bonaparte, who was to become EmperorNapoleon IIIof the French ten years later, in 1851. During this trip, he promised that cousin of Louis Bonaparte that he would write a novel with the island's name in the title. In 1841 when Dumas made his promise, Louis Bonaparte himself was imprisoned at the citadel of Ham – the place mentioned in the novel. Dumas did visit him there,[29]although Dumas does not mention it in ""Etat civil""."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67138,The Sun Also Rises,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Also_Rises,"On the surface, the novel is a love story between theprotagonistJake Barnes—a man whose war wound has made him unable to havesex—and the promiscuous divorcée Lady Brett Ashley. Jake is anexpatriateAmerican journalist living inParis, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman withbobbedhair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Jake's Princeton friend Robert Cohn (whom the characters often refer to by his last name) causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-oldmatadorRomero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards inPamplona.

Book One is set in thecafé societyof young American expatriates in Paris. In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with Cohn, picks up aprostitutenamed Georgette, and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they both know that they have no chance at a stable relationship.

In Book Two, Jake is joined by Bill Gorton, recently arrived fromNew York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives fromScotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Cohn atBayonnefor a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona to wait for the overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn had an affair with Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams nearBurguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.

All begin to drink heavily. Cohn is resented by the others, who taunt him withantisemiticremarks. During thefiesta, the characters drink, eat, watch therunning of the bulls, attend bullfights, and bicker. Jake introduces Brett to the 19-year-old matador Romero at the Hotel Montoya; she is smitten with him and seduces him. The jealous tension among the men builds—Jake, Mike, Cohn, and Romero each want Brett. Cohn, who had been a championboxerin college, has a fistfight with Jake and Mike, and another with Romero, whom he beats up. Despite his injuries, Romero continues to perform brilliantly in the bullring.

Book Three shows the characters in the aftermath of the fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes toSan Sebastiánon the northern coast ofSpain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives atelegramfrom Brett asking for help; she had gone toMadridwith Romero. He finds her in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking and thinking of what might have been.

The first book ofThe Sun Also Risesis set in mid-1920s Paris.  Americans were drawn to Paris in theRoaring Twentiesby the favorableexchange rate, with as many as 200,000 English-speaking expatriates living there.  TheParis Tribunereported in 1925 that Paris had anAmerican Hospital, an American Library, and an American Chamber of Commerce.[30]Many American writers were disenchanted with the US, where they found less artistic freedom than in Europe. (For example, Hemingway was in Paris during the period whenUlysses, written by his friendJames Joyce, was banned  and burned in New York.)[31]

The themes ofThe Sun Also Risesappear in its twoepigraphs. The first is anallusionto the ""Lost Generation"", a term coined byGertrude Steinreferring to the post-war generation;[note 2][32]the other epigraph is a long quotation fromEcclesiastes: ""One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.""[33]Hemingway told his editor Max Perkins that the book was not so much about a generation being lost, but that ""the earth abideth forever."" He thought the characters inThe Sun Also Risesmay have been ""battered"" but were not lost.[5]

Hemingway scholar Wagner-Martin writes that Hemingway wanted the book to be about morality, which he emphasized by changing the working title fromFiestatoThe Sun Also Rises.Wagner-Martin argues that the book can be read either as a novel about bored expatriates or as a morality tale about a protagonist who searches for integrity in an immoral world.[34]Months before Hemingway left for Pamplona, the press was depicting the ParisianLatin Quarter, where he lived, as decadent and depraved.  He began writing the story of a matador corrupted by the influence of the Latin Quarter crowd; he expanded it into a novel about Jake Barnes at risk of being corrupted by wealthy and inauthentic expatriates.[35]

The characters form a group, sharing similar norms, and each greatly affected by the war.[34]Hemingway captures the angst of the age and transcends the love story of Brett and Jake, although they are representative of the period: Brett is starved for reassurance and love and Jake is sexually maimed.  His wound symbolizes the disability of the age, the disillusion, and the frustrations felt by an entire generation.[34]

Hemingway thought he lost touch with American values while living in Paris, but his biographerMichael S. Reynoldsclaims the opposite, seeing evidence of the author'smidwestern Americanvalues in the novel.  Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of ""the rotten crowd"" living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval of the people who did not pay up.[36]Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, and those who do not work for a living spend their lives posing.[37]

The twice-divorced Brett Ashley represented the liberatedNew Woman(in the 1920s, divorces were common and easy to be had in Paris).[38]James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created one of the more fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: the men drink too much and fight over her. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes aCircein the festival.[39]Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway ""treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy.""[40]She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.[41]

Nagel considers the novel a tragedy. Jake and Brett have a relationship that becomes destructive because their love cannot be consummated.  Conflict over Brett destroys Jake's friendship with Robert Cohn, and her behavior in Pamplona affects Jake's hard-won reputation among the Spaniards.[39]Meyers sees Brett as a woman who wants sex without love while Jake can only give her love without sex.  Although Brett sleeps with many men, it is Jake she loves.[42]Dana Fore writes that Brett is willing to be with Jake in spite of his disability, in a ""non-traditional erotic relationship.""[43]Other critics such asLeslie FiedlerandNina Baymsee her as a supreme bitch; Fiedler sees Brett as one of the ""outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'""[44][45]Jake becomes bitter about their relationship, as when he says, ""Send a girl off with a man .... Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love.""[46]

Critics interpret the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways.  Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality.[47]Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship in such a manner that Jake knew ""that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill.""[48]Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid toSan Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike.[49]In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, ""you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her.""[50]By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her.[50]Reynolds believes that Jake represents the ""everyman,"" and that in the course of the narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as amorality playwith Jake as the person who loses the most.[51]

InThe Sun Also Rises, Hemingway contrasts Paris with Pamplona, and the frenzy of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside.  Spain was among Hemingway's favorite European countries; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country ""that hasn't been shot to pieces.""[52]He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing,

He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—calledafición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisianbohemians.[53]To be accepted as anaficionadowas rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the ""fellowship ofafición.""[54]

Allen Josephs thinks the novel is centered on thecorrida(the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between the world of the inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death.[55]Thecorridais presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment ofexistentialismornada(nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.[56]

Hemingway presents matadors as heroic characters dancing in a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, in contrast to the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced.[34]Critic Keneth Kinnamon argues that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character.[54]Hemingway named Romero afterPedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still.  Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the ""one idealized figure in the novel.""[57]Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one ofrecibiendo(receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.[58]

Before the group arrives in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take a fishing trip to the Irati River. AsHarold Bloompoints out, the scene serves as an interlude between the Paris and Pamplona sections, ""an oasis that exists outside linear time.""  On another level it reflects ""the mainstream of American fiction beginning with the Pilgrims seeking refuge from English oppression""—the prominent theme in American literature of escaping into the wilderness, as seen inCooper,Hawthorne,Melville,Twain, andThoreau.[59]Fiedler calls the theme ""The Sacred Land""; he thinks the American West is evoked inThe Sun Also Risesby thePyreneesand given a symbolic nod with the name of the ""Hotel Montana.""[44]In Hemingway's writing, nature is a place of refuge and rebirth, according to Stoltzfus, where the hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at the moment the prey is killed.[56]Nature is the place where men act without women: men fish, men hunt, men find redemption.[44]In nature Jake and Bill do not need to discuss the war because their war experience, paradoxically, is ever-present. The nature scenes serve as counterpoint to the fiesta scenes.[34]

All of the characters drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay ""Alcoholism in Hemingway'sThe Sun Also Rises"", Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake's self-pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic, as is Brett's out-of-control behavior.[60]William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch.[61]Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context ofProhibition in the United States.  The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition.  Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, he drinks constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.[62]

Critics have seen Jake as an ambiguous representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, in the bar scene in Paris, Jake is angry at somehomosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity.[63]His sense of masculine identity is lost—he is less than a man.[64]Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women.[65]Hemingway's writing has been calledhomophobicbecause of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, ""I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot.""[66]

In contrast to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery and competence. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might be trying to undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.[67]

Critics have examined issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent in much of Hemingway's work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women.[68]In his fiction, a woman's hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, isandrogynousand compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity lies in the fact that she is described as a ""damned fine-looking woman."" While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects Brett because, among other things, she will not grow her hair.

Hemingway has been called antisemitic, most notably because of the characterization of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'.[70]Shunned by the other members of the group, Cohn is characterized as ""different"", unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta.[70]Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith.[34]Barry Gross, comparing Jewish characters in literature of the period, commented that ""Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.""[71][72]Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a ""shlemiel"" (or fool), but she points out that Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.[73]

Cohn is based onHarold Loeb, a fellow writer who rivaled Hemingway for the affections of Duff, Lady Twysden (the real-life inspiration for Brett). Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that in 1925, Loeb should have declined Hemingway's invitation to join them in Pamplona. Before the trip, he was Duff's lover and Hemingway's friend; during the fiasco of the fiesta, he lost Duff and Hemingway's friendship. Hemingway used Loeb as the basis of a character remembered chiefly as a ""rich Jew.""[74]

The Sun Also Risesreflects the pervasive disillusionment experienced by the ""Lost Generation"" in the aftermath ofWorld War I. The novel portrays a world where traditional sources of meaning—religion, work, and love—fail to provide lasting fulfillment, leaving characters trapped in cycles of dissatisfaction. Jake Barnes and his expatriate companions struggle to find purpose in a modern world marked by loss and despair. Hemingway suggests that the only viable response to this existential crisis is a stoic acceptance of life’s inherent tragedy. His sparse prose and emphasis on omission underscore the underlying themes of repressed desires and emotional detachment.[75]

The novel is well known for its style, which is variously described as modern,hard-boiled, or understated.[76]As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned toEzra Pound—who had a reputation as ""an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent""—to mark and blue-ink his short stories.[77]From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in themoderniststyle: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book's conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake.[76][note 3]The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to ""distrust adjectives,"" he created a style ""in accordance with the esthetics and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by shutting the door on sentiment, on the subjective.""[78]

F. Scott Fitzgeraldtold Hemingway to ""let the book's action play itself out among its characters."" Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin writes that, in taking Fitzgerald's advice, Hemingway produced a novel without a central narrator: ""Hemingway's book was a step ahead; it was the modernist novel.""[79]When Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to trim at least 2500 words from the opening sequence, which was 30 pages long, Hemingway wired the publishers telling them to cut the opening 30 pages altogether. The result was a novel without a focused starting point, which was seen as a modern perspective and critically well received.[80]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081,The Alchemist,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(play),"An outbreak of plague in London forces a gentleman, Lovewit, to flee temporarily to the country. He leaves his house under the sole charge of his butler, Jeremy. Jeremy uses the opportunity given to him to use the house as the headquarters for fraudulent acts. He transforms himself into ""Captain Face"", and enlists the aid of Subtle, a fellow conman, and Dol Common, a prostitute.

The play opens with a violent argument between Subtle and Face concerning the division of the riches which they have, and will continue to gather. Face threatens to have an engraving made of Subtle with a face worse than that of the notorious highwaymanGamaliel Ratsey. Dol breaks the pair apart and reasons with them that they must work as a team if they are to succeed. Their first customer is Dapper, a lawyer's clerk who wishes Subtle to use his supposed necromantic skills to summon a ""familiar"" or spirit to help in his gambling ambitions. The tripartite suggest that Dapper may win favour with the ""Queen of Fairy"", but he must subject himself to humiliating rituals in order for her to help him. Their second gull is Drugger, a tobacconist, who is keen to establish a profitable business. After this, a wealthy nobleman, Sir Epicure Mammon, arrives, expressing the desire to gain himself thephilosopher's stone, which he believes will bring him huge material and spiritual wealth. He is accompanied by Surly, a sceptic and debunker of the whole idea ofalchemy. He is promised the philosopher's stone and promised that it will turn all base metal into gold. Surly however, suspects Subtle of being a thief. Mammon accidentally sees Dol and is told that she is a Lord's sister who is suffering from madness. Subtle contrives to become angry with Ananias, anAnabaptist, and demands that he should return with a more senior member of his sect (Tribulation). Drugger returns and is given false and ludicrous advice about setting up his shop; he also brings news that a rich young widow (Dame Pliant) and her brother (Kastril) have arrived in London. Both Subtle and Face in their greed and ambition seek out to win the widow.

The Anabaptists return and agree to pay for goods to be transmuted into gold. These are in fact Mammon's goods. Dapper returns and is promised that he shall meet with the Queen of Fairy soon. Drugger brings Kastril who, on being told that Subtle is a skilled match-maker, rushes to fetch his sister. Drugger is given to understand that the appropriate payment might secure his marriage to the widow. Dapper is blindfolded and subjected to 'fairy' humiliations; but on the reappearance of Mammon, he is gagged and hastily thrust into the privy. Mammon is introduced to Dol. He has been told that Dol is a nobleman's sister who has gone mad, but he is not put off, and pays her extravagant compliments. Kastril and his sister come again. Kastril is given a lesson in quarrelling, and the widow captivates both Face and Subtle. They quarrel over who is to have her.

Surly returns, disguised as a Spanish nobleman. Face and Subtle believe that the Spaniard speaks no English and they insult him. They also believe that he has come for a woman, but Dol is elsewhere in the building 'engaged' with Mammon, so Face has the inspiration of using Dame Pliant. She is reluctant to become a Spanish countess but is vigorously persuaded by her brother to go off with Surly. The tricksters need to get rid of Mammon. Dol contrives a fit and there is an 'explosion' from the 'laboratory'. In addition, the lady's furious brother is hunting for Mammon, who leaves. Surly reveals his true identity to Dame Pliant and hopes that she will look on him favourably as a consequence. Surly reveals his true identity to Face and Subtle, and denounces them. In quick succession Kastril, Drugger and Ananias return, and are set on Surly, who retreats. Drugger is told to go and find a Spanish costume if he is to have a chance of claiming the widow. Dol brings news that the master of the house has returned.

Lovewit's neighbours tell him that his house had many visitors during his absence. Face is now the plausible Jeremy again, and denies the accusation—-he has kept the house locked up because of the plague. Surly, Mammon, Kastril and the Anabaptists return. There is a cry from the privy; Dapper has chewed through his gag. Jeremy can no longer maintain his fiction. He promises Lovewit that if he pardons him, he will help him obtain himself a rich widow (i.e., Dame Pliant). Dapper meets the ""Queen of Fairy"" and departs happily. Drugger delivers the Spanish costume and is sent to find a parson. Face tells Subtle and Dol that he has confessed to Lovewit, and that officers are on the way; Subtle and Dol have to flee, empty handed.

The victims come back again. Lovewit has married the widow and claimed Mammon's goods; Surly and Mammon depart disconsolately. The Anabaptists and Drugger are summarily dismissed. Kastril accepts his sister's marriage to Lovewit.  Lovewit pays tribute to the ingenuity of his servant, and Face asks for the audience's forgiveness. Jeremy now left alone to describe the epilogue.

InThe Alchemist, Jonson unashamedly satirises the follies, vanities and vices of mankind, most notably greed-induced credulity. People of all social classes are subject to Jonson's ruthless, satirical wit. He mocks human weakness and gullibility to advertising and to ""miracle cures"" with the character of Sir Epicure Mammon, who dreams of drinking theelixir of youthand enjoying fantastic sexual conquests.

The Alchemistfocuses on what happens when one human being seeks advantage over another. In a big city like London, this process of advantage-seeking is rife. The trio of con-artists – Subtle, Face and Doll – are self-deluding small-timers, ultimately undone by the same human weaknesses they exploit in their victims. Their fate is foreshadowed in the play's opening scene, which features them together in the house of Lovewit, Face's master. In a metaphor which runs through the play, the dialogue shows them to exist in uneasy imbalance, like alchemical elements that will create an unstable reaction. Barely ten lines into the text, Face and Subtle's quarrelling forces Doll to quell their raised voices: ""Will you have the neighbours hear you?  Will you betray all?”

The con-artists' vanities and aspirations are revealed by the very personae they assume as part of their plan.  The lowly housekeeper, Face, casts himself as asea captain(a man accustomed to giving orders, instead of taking them), the egotistical Subtle casts himself as an alchemist (as one who can do what no one else can; turn base metal into gold), and Dol Common casts herself as an aristocratic lady. Their incessant bickering is fuelled by vanity, envy and jealousy, the root of which is Subtle's conviction that he is the key element in the 'venture tripartite':

The 'venture tripartite' is as doomed as one of the Romantriumvirates. The play's end sees Subtle and Dol resume their original pairing, while Face resumes his role as housekeeper to a wealthy master. Significantly, none of the three is severely punished (the collapse of their scheme aside). Jonson's theatrical microcosm is not a neatly moral one; and he seems to enjoy seeing foolish characters like Epicure Mammon get their comeuppance. This is why, while London itself is a target of Jonson's satire, it is also, as his Prologue boasts, a cozening-ground worth celebrating: ""Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known/No country’s mirth is better than our own/No clime breeds better matter for your whore...”

The Alchemistis tightly structured, based around a simple dramatic concept.  Subtle claims to be on the verge ofprojectionin his offstage workroom, but all the characters in the play are overly-concerned with projection of a different kind: image-projection.  The result, in structural terms, is an onstage base of operations in Friars, to which can be brought a succession of unconsciously comic characters from different social backgrounds, who hold different professions and different beliefs, but whose lowest common denominator – gullibility – grants them equal victim-status in the end.  Dapper, the aspirant gambler, loses his stake; Sir Epicure Mammon loses his money and his dignity; Drugger, the would-be businessman, parts with his cash, but ends up no nearer to the success he craves; the Puritan duo, Tribulation and Ananias, never realise their scheme to counterfeit Dutch money.

Jonson reserves his harshest satire for these Puritan characters—perhaps because the Puritans, in real life, wished to close down the theatres[citation needed]. (Jonson's playBartholomew Fairis also anti-Puritan.) Tellingly, of all those gulled in the play, it is the Puritans alone whom Jonson denies a brief moment of his audience's pity; presumably, he reckons their life-denying self-righteousness renders them unworthy of it. Jonson consistently despises hypocrisy, especially religious hypocrisy that couches its damning judgments in high-flown language. Tribulation and Ananias call their fellow men ""heathens"" and in one case, say that someone's hat suggests ""the Anti-Christ"".  That these Puritans are just as money-hungry as the rest of the characters is part of the ironic joke.

In many English and European comedies, it is up to a high-class character to resolve the confusion that has been caused by lower-class characters. InThe Alchemist, Jonson subverts this tradition. Face's master, Lovewit, at first seems to assert his social and ethical superiority to put matters to rights. But when Face dangles before him the prospect of marriage to a younger woman, his master eagerly accepts. Both master and servant are always on the lookout for how to get ahead in life, regardless of ethical boundaries. Lovewit adroitly exploits Mammon's reluctance to obtain legal certification of his folly to hold on to the old man's money.

Internal references indicate that the play was written for performance at Blackfriars; ironically, given its initial scenario, plague forced the company to tour, andThe Alchemistpremiered at Oxford in 1610, with performance in London later that year. Its success may be indicated by its performance at court in 1613 and again in 1623. Evidence of a more ambiguous kind is presented by the case ofThomas Tomkis'sAlbumazar, performed forKing James IatCambridgein 1615. A tradition apparently originating withDrydenheld that Jonson had been influenced by Tomkis's academic comedy. Dryden may have mentioned Jonson to increase interest in a somewhat obscure play he was then reviving; he may also have been confused about the dates. At any rate, the question of influence now runs the other way.Albumazaris, primarily, an adaptation ofGiambattista della Porta's ""L'Astrologo""; however, both the similarity in subject matter and Tomkis's apparent familiarity with commercial dramaturgy make it possible that he was aware ofThe Alchemist, and may have been responding to the play's success.

The play continued onstage as adrollduring the Commonwealth period; after theRestoration, it belonged to the repertory of the King's Men ofThomas Killigrew, who appear to have performed it with some frequency during their first years in operation. The play is not known to have been performed between 1675 and 1709, but the frequency of performance after 1709 suggests that it probably was. Indeed, the play was frequently performed during the eighteenth century; bothColley CibberandDavid Garrickwere notable successes in the role of Drugger, for whom a small amount of new material, including farces and monologues, in the latter half of the century was created.

After this period of flourishing, the play fell into desuetude, along with nearly all non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama, until the beginning of the twentieth century.William Poel'sElizabethan Stage Societyproduced the play in 1899. This opening was followed a generation later by productions atMalvernin 1932, withRalph Richardsonas Face, and atThe Old Vicin 1947. In the latter production,Alec Guinnessplayed Drugger, alongside Richardson as Face.

Mark Mirsky directed with ""lusty zest"" a performance at Harvard'sLoeb Drama Centerin 1961. Eric Martin's set was considered ""original, simple, serviceable, brilliant"".[1]

TheOregon Shakespeare Festivalstaged a fast-paced, nearly farcical production in 1961; Gerard Larson played Face, and Nagle Jackson Face,[clarification needed]under Edward Brubaker's direction. The performance received generally favourable reviews; however, a 1973 production set in theWild Westsetting did not; the setting was generally considered inconsistent with the tone and treatment of the play.

In 1962,Tyrone Guthrieproduced a modernised version at the Old Vic, withLeo McKernas Subtle andCharles Grayas Mammon.Trevor Nunn's 1977 production with theRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturedIan McKellenas a ""greasy, misanthropic"" Face, in a version adapted byPeter Barnes. The original was played at theRoyal National Theatre, withAlex JenningsandSimon Russell Bealein the central roles, from September to November 2006. A contemporary dress production directed byMichael Kahnopened the 2009/2010 season at theShakespeare Theatre Companyin Washington, DC. Another contemporary dress production was directed by Tariq Leslie and produced by the Ensemble Theatre Co-operative at the Jericho Arts Centre, Vancouver, Canada in the summer of 2012.[2]

TheStratford Shakespeare Festival's 2015 season included a production directed byAntoni CimolinowithStephen Ouimetteas Subtle, Jonathan Goad as Face and Brigit Wilson as Dol.[3]

A newRSCproduction directed by Polly Findlay and featuringKen Nwosuas ""Face"", Hywel Morgan as ""Lovewit"", Siobhan McSweeney as ""Dol"" and Mark Lockyer as ""Subtle"" was scheduled to open at London'sBarbican Theatreon 2 September 2016.[4]

TheColorado Shakespeare Festivalhas scheduled an ""Original Practices"" performance for its summer 2022 season.[5]

The Southwest Shakespeare Company offered three performances in April 2023 at Taliesen West in Scottsdale, Arizona. The play was presented in the form of a 1940s radio play.

A quarto of the play appeared in 1612 published byWalter Burre, printed byThomas Snodhamand sold by John Stepneth."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13951,Les trois mousquetaires (French),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers,"In 1625 France, D'Artagnan leaves his family inGasconyand travels toParisto join theMusketeers of the Guard. At a house inMeung-sur-Loire, an older man derides D'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, D'Artagnan demands a duel. The older man's companions instead beat D'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, a King's elite regiment, is stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the older man, who is actually theComte de Rochefort, an agent ofCardinal Richelieu, who is passing the latter's orders to his spy,Milady de Winter.

In Paris, D'Artagnan visits Tréville at the Musketeers' headquarters. Without the letter, he faces a lukewarm reception from Tréville. Before their conversation concludes, D'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street through Tréville's window and rushes out of the building to confront him. Pursuing Rochefort, he separately offends three musketeers,Athos,PorthosandAramis, who each demand satisfaction; D'Artagnan must fight a duel with each of them that afternoon.

As D'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos'ssecondsare Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the Gascon intends to duel them all. As D'Artagnan and Athos begin, Richelieu's guards appear and attempt to arrest the musketeers for illegal dueling. Offered to leave by the Cardinal's guards, D'Artagnan decides to help the musketeers. Despite being outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle. D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of Richelieu's officers and a renowned fighter. KingLouis XIIIappoints D'Artagnan to Des Essart's company of the King's Guards, a less prestigious regiment, and gives him fortypistoles.

D'Artagnan hires a servant named Planchet and finds lodgings with Bonacieux, a merchant. His landlord later mentions the kidnapping of his wife, Constance Bonacieux, who works forQueen Anne of France. When she is released, D'Artagnan falls inlove at first sightwith her.  Queen Anne secretly meets theDuke of Buckingham, England's first minister. At the meeting, she gives him a diamond necklace, the King's gift to her, as a keepsake.

Richelieu, who wants to diminish the influence of Queen Anne and her Spanish entourage on French internal affairs, plots to persuade the King that his wife is having an affair with Buckingham. On his advice, the King demands that the Queen wears the diamonds to an upcoming soirée. Constance tries to send her husband to London to fetch the diamonds, but he is instead manipulated by Richelieu and thus does not go, so D'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route to England, Richelieu's henchmen attack them and only D'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before arriving, D'Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly to kill Comte de Wardes, a friend of Richelieu, cousin of Rochefort and Milady's love interest. Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan thus returns a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne in time to save her honor.

D'Artagnan hopes to begin an affair with the grateful Constance. Invited to a date, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and Bonacieux, acting under the orders of Richelieu, have kidnapped Constance. D'Artagnan traces his steps back to find his friends whom he abandoned wounded on his way to London. At their meeting, Athos, drunk, tells D'Artagnan a story about a count who fell in love with and married a young woman. Months later, the count discovered that his wife was branded with afleur-de-lison her shoulder, a punishment for felony. The count left her to die in a forest with her hands tied, abandoned his family castle and joined the King's guard under another name. D'Artagnan understands that Athos is telling his own story.

In Paris, D'Artagnan meets Milady and recognizes her as one of Richelieu's agents. He becomes infatuated with her, though her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent towards him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be Comte de Wardes, whom she invited in a letter that D'Artagnan intercepted andmakes love to her. However, D'Artagnan is not content with Milady's having sex with him thinking that he is de Wardes. He fakes a rude letter from de Wardes, offending Milady. She asks D'Artagnan to duel and kill the Comte. As a prepayment, he has sex with her again, without assuming a fake identity. In the heat of passion, D'Artagnan reveals that it is not the first time they are together. Milady is enraged and in the subsequent scuffle, D'Artagnan discovers afleur-de-lisbranded on her shoulder. Milady attempts to kill D'Artagnan, who eludes her. He later tells Athos that his former wife is alive.

Cardinal Richelieu offers D'Artagnan a career in his guards' ranks. Dreading the prospect of losing his friends, D'Artagnan refuses despite understanding that his career prospects diminish as a result. With their regiments, D'Artagnan and the three musketeers are ordered to theSiege of La Rochelle. There, the four friends survive two assassination attempts by Milady's agents. The would-be assassins die in the process.

At an inn, Athos overhears Richelieu asking Milady to murder Buckingham, whose support is critical to the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle. Richelieu gives her his order absolving the bearer from any responsibility, but Athos takes the order from her. To get time to secretly consult with his friends, Athos bets that he, D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis will hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour next morning. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing a dozen Rochelaise in the process, which adds to their legend. They warn the Queen and Lord de Winter about Milady's plan to assassinate Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England, but seduces her guard, Felton,[a]and persuades him to allow her to escape and to kill Buckingham himself.

D'Artagnan is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. He gets a permission to take her from a convent where the Queen sent her to hide.

Upon her return to France, Milady hides, coincidentally, in the convent where Constance is hiding. The naïve Constance clings to Milady who pretends to be another victim of the Cardinal's intrigues. Seeking revenge on D'Artagnan, Milady poisons Constance before he arrives to rescue her. The musketeers catch Milady before she reaches Richelieu. Summoning a local executioner, they put Milady on trial, sentence her to death, and have her executed. The executioner reveals that it was he who branded Milady as a felon years before after she, a young nun at the time, seduced and then abandoned his brother, a local priest.

When the four friends return to the Siege of La Rochelle, Richelieu's Guards arrest D’Artagnan. D'Artagnan gives the Cardinal the secret order absolving the bearer of any responsibility which Athos had taken from Milady. Impressed with D'Artagnan's candor and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, Richelieu destroys the order and writes a new one, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in Tréville's company, leaving the name blank. D'Artagnan offers the letter to his three friends in turn, but each refuses it; Athos because it is beneath him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress, and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood. D'Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, receives the promotion he had coveted.

Les Trois Mousquetaireswas translated into three English versions by 1846. One of these, by William Barrow (1817–1877),[6]is still in print and fairly faithful to the original, available in the Oxford World's Classics 1999 edition. To conform to 19th-century English standards, all of the explicit and many of the implicit references to sexuality were removed, adversely affecting the readability of several scenes, such as the scenes between d'Artagnan and Milady.

In 1960 Manfred E.Graham adapted the book for the Longman's Simplified English Series.

There are 3 modern translations as well. One recent English translation is by Will Hobson in 2002.

Another is byRichard Pevear(2006),[7]who, though applauding Barrow's work, states that most of the modern translations available today are ""textbook examples of bad translation practices"" which ""give their readers an extremely distorted notion of Dumas' writing.""[8]

The most recent translation is by the American translator Lawrence Ellsworth (Lawrence Schick) published by Pegasus Books in February 2018 from the 1956 French edition.

Ellsworth decided to translate the full trilogy ofThe d'Artagnan Romancesas well as the two novels of The Count of Moret for 21st century readers in nine volumes, making it the first complete translation in over a century and a half. Seven out of nine volumes have been published and the eighth volume is in progress in a serialized online publication.[9][needs update]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833,The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Portrait_of_a_Lady,"23-year-old Isabel Archer, fromAlbany, New York, is invited by her maternal aunt, Lydia Touchett, to visit Lydia's rich husband, Daniel, at his estate near London, following the death of Isabel's father. There, Isabel meets her uncle, her friendly invalid cousin Ralph Touchett, and the Touchetts' robust neighbor, Lord Warburton.

Isabel later declines Warburton's sudden proposal of marriage. She also rejects the hand of Caspar Goodwood, the charismatic son and heir of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Although Isabel is drawn to Caspar, her commitment to her independence precludes such a marriage, which she feels would demand the sacrifice of her freedom.

The elder Touchett grows ill and, at the request of his son, Ralph, leaves much of his estate to Isabel upon his death. With her large legacy, Isabel travels the Continent and meets an American expatriate, Gilbert Osmond, inFlorence. Although Isabel had previously rejected both Warburton and Goodwood, she accepts Osmond's proposal of marriage, unaware that it has been actively promoted by the accomplished but untrustworthy Madame Merle, another American expatriate, whom Isabel had met at the Touchetts' estate.

Isabel and Osmond settle in Rome, but their marriage rapidly sours, owing to Osmond's overwhelming egotism and lack of genuine affection for his wife. Isabel grows fond of Pansy, Osmond's presumed daughter by his first marriage, and wants to support her wish to marry Edward Rosier, a young art collector.

The snobbish Osmond would prefer that Pansy accept the proposal of Warburton, who had previously proposed to Isabel. Isabel suspects, however, that Warburton may just be feigning interest in Pansy to get close to Isabel again, and the conflict creates even more strain within the unhappy marriage after Osmond demands that Isabel should leverage her supposed influence over Warburton to bring about his marriage to Pansy.

Isabel then learns that Ralph is dying at his estate in England and prepares to go to him for his final hours, but Osmond selfishly opposes this plan, threatening revenge if she proceeds against his disapproval. After this dispute, Isabel learns from her sister-in-law that Pansy is actually the daughter of Madame Merle, who had had an adulterous relationship with Osmond for several years.

Isabel pays a final visit to Pansy, who was sent to a convent by Osmond as an implicit demonstration of his authority vis-à-vis his wife, and their meeting terminates with Pansy begging her to return some day, which Isabel reluctantly promises to do. A meeting with Madame Merle, who too had been visiting Pansy at the same hour, confirms Isabel's suspicions of her relations to Osmond and Pansy. She then leaves, without telling her spiteful husband, to comfort the dying Ralph in England, where she remains until his death. While previously she had concealed the unhappiness of her marriage with Osmond to Ralph, Isabel discloses it to him on his deathbed. Ralph grieves that in delivering his father's fortune to his cousin, he has ruined her, but urges that she may still, as she is yet young, regain the freedom that she had relinquished in marrying.

Goodwood encounters her at Ralph's estate and begs her to leave Osmond and come away with him. He passionately embraces and kisses her, but Isabel flees. Goodwood seeks her out the next day but is told she has set off again for Rome.

The ending is ambiguous, and the reader is left to imagine whether Isabel will return to Osmond to endure her marriage in noble forbearance (perhaps for Pansy's sake), or instead rescue Pansy and leave Osmond.

James's first idea forThe Portrait of a Ladywas simple: a young American woman ""affronting her destiny,""[1]whatever it might be. Only then did he begin to form a plot to bring out the character of his central figure. This was the uncompromising story of the free-spirited Isabel losing her freedom—despite (or because of) suddenly coming into a great deal of money—and getting ""ground in the very mill of the conventional.""[3]

The Portrait of a Ladyhas received critical acclaim since its first publication inThe Atlantic Monthly, and it remains the most popular of James's longer fictions.[citation needed]Contemporary critics recognise that James had pushed the analysis of human consciousness and motivation to new levels, particularly in such passages as Chapter 42, where Isabel meditates deep into the night about her marriage and the trap she seems to have fallen into.[citation needed]James gave an in-depth account of Isabel's deepest terrors in his preface to the novel's 1908New York Edition.[4]

More recent criticism has been levelled by feminists. In particular, Isabel's final return to Osmond has fascinated critics, who have debated whether James sufficiently justifies this seemingly paradoxical rejection of freedom. One interpretation is that Isabel feels as honour-bound to the promise she has made to stepdaughter Pansy as she does to her marriage, and that she believes the scene her ""unacceptable"" trip to England will create with Osmond will leave her in a more justifiable position to abandon her marriage.[citation needed]

The extensive revisions James made for the 1908New York Editiongenerally have been accepted as improvements, unlike the changes he made to other texts, such asThe AmericanorRoderick Hudson. The revision of the final scene between Isabel and Goodwood has been especially applauded. Edward Wagenknecht wrote that James ""makes it as clear as any modern novelist could make it by using all the four-letter words in the dictionary that [Isabel] has been roused as never before in her life, roused in the true sense perhaps for the first time in her life."" James's verbal magic allowed him to both obey and evade the restrictive conventions of his day for the treatment of sexuality in literature.[citation needed]

Critic Alfred Habegger has written that the main character ofPortraitwas inspired by Christie Archer, the protagonist ofAnne Moncure Crane's novelReginald Archer(1871). Crane may have influenced James, who Habegger believes was interested in Crane's female characters.[citation needed]

In the preface to the 1908New York Edition, James referred to several ofGeorge Eliot's female protagonists as possible influences. Habegger questions this and quotes others doing the same.[5]

In another critical article, ""Rewriting Misogyny:The Portrait of a Ladyand the Popular Fiction Debate"", Paul M. Hadella mentions the similarities to Crane.[6]

In 1884, when the actorLawrence Barrettwanted James to turn the novel into a play, James replied that he did not think it could be done.[7]In his opinion, given in the preface to the New York Edition, the best scene in the book consists of Isabel sitting motionless in a chair.[8]

The story was adapted as a Broadway play byWilliam Archibald, which opened in December 1954, withBarbara O'Neilin the role of Madame Serena Merle.[9]

They chronicle the vicissitudes of the leading members of a large upper-middle-class English family that is similar to Galsworthy's.[1]Only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors, its members are keenly aware of their status as ""new money"".

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22981,Letters of Two Brides,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9moires_de_deux_jeunes_mari%C3%A9es,"The story concerns two young French women, Louise de Chaulieu (1805–1835) and Renée de Maucombe (born 1807), who become close friends during their novitiate at the Carmelite convent ofBlois. When they leave the convent, however, their lives follow two very different paths. Louise chooses a life of romance, whereas Renée takes a much more pragmatic approach; but their friendship is preserved through their correspondence, which continues for a dozen years from 1823 through 1835.

Louise is expected to sacrifice herself for her two brothers and take the veil, but the young girl refuses to submit to such a fate. Her dying grandmother intercedes on her behalf and bequeaths her her fortune, thereby rescuing her from the enclosed life of a Carmelite nun and leaving her financially independent. Free to assist her brothers financially without having to sacrifice her own ambitions, Louise settles in Paris and throws herself into a life of Italian operas, masqued balls and romantic intrigues. She falls in love with an unbecoming but noble Spaniard, Felipe Hénarez, Baron de Macumer. Banished from Spain, he lives incognito in Paris where he is forced to support himself by teaching Spanish. When he regains his fortune and noble standing, he woos Louise with a romantic fervour that finally wins her over. The pair are married in March 1825. They live a life of carefree happiness, but Louise's jealousy embitters him and leads to his physical break-down. He dies in 1829, leaving a grieving widow of twenty-four.

Renée de Maucombe's attitude to love and life are in marked contrast to those of Louise. When she leaves the convent at Blois Renée moves toProvence, where she marries an older man of little wealth or standing whom she can hardly be said to love. She bears Louis de L'Estorade three children, and over the course of the next decade she devotes herself body and soul to the happiness of her family. Gradually she grows to love her husband in her own way, and with her encouragement he makes a career for himself in local politics, which culminates in his becoming a peer of France and a grand officer of theLegion of Honour. During this time Renée is quite scathing in her criticisms of Louise, whom she sees as a selfish and self-indulgent coquette. True happiness for a woman lies in motherhood and devotion to her family.

Meanwhile, four years after the death of Felipe, Louise falls in love again. This time the object of her love is a poor poet and playwright Marie Gaston, who is several years younger than she is. As though taking a leaf out of Renée's book, Louise sells her Parisian property, moves to a chalet inVille-d'Avray(a small village near Paris) and lives a life of seclusion with her new husband. But Renée is not fooled by this masquerade. Louise, she warns, is still living a life devoted to selfishness and self-indulgence, while true happiness lies only in self-sacrifice to one's husband and children - Louise remains childless.

After a few years of apparent bliss, Louise detects a change in her husband. He becomes solicitous about the financial success of his plays, and a large sum of money goes missing. Suspecting him of having an expensive mistress, Louise makes enquiries and comes to the shocking conclusion that he has another family in Paris – an Englishwoman known by the name Madame Gaston, and two children, who look remarkably like Marie. Louise confides her feelings of despair to Renée and announces her determination to commit suicide rather than to submit to such a fate. Renée's husband makes enquiries and discovers the truth of the situation. Madame Gaston is the widow of Marie's brother. The death of her husband has left her financially destitute and Marie has taken it upon himself to assist her and his two nephews, but he is ashamed to ask his wife for money. Reneé writes to Louise to inform her of the truth and rushes to the chalet, but she is too late. Louise has contracted consumption by lying out in the dew overnight and she dies a few days later."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8121,Ghosts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_(play),"Helen Alving is about to dedicate anorphanage, which she has built in memory of her late husband, Captain Alving. Despite her husband's affairs, Mrs. Alving stayed with him to protect her son Oswald from the taint of scandal and for fear of being shunned by the community.

In the course of the play, she discovers that Oswald (whom she had sent away to avoid his being corrupted by his father) is suffering fromsyphilis, which she believes he inherited from his father.[a]She also discovers that Oswald has fallen in love with her maid Regina Engstrand, who is revealed to be the illegitimate daughter of Captain Alving and is therefore Oswald'shalf-sister.

A sub-plot involves a carpenter, Jacob Engstrand, who married Regina's mother when she was already pregnant. He regards Regina as his own daughter. He is unaware, or pretends to be, that Captain Alving was Regina's father. Having recently completed his work building Mrs. Alving's orphanage, Engstrand announces his ambition to open a hostel forseafarers. He tries to persuade Regina to leave Mrs. Alving and help him run the hostel, but she refuses. The night before the orphanage is due to open, Engstrand asksPastorManders to hold a prayer-meeting there. Later that night, the orphanage burns down. Earlier, Manders had persuaded Mrs. Alving not to insure the orphanage, as to do so would imply a lack of faith in divine providence. Engstrand says the blaze was caused by Manders' carelessness with a candle and offers to take the blame, which Manders readily accepts. Manders in turn offers to support Engstrand's hostel.

When Regina and Oswald's sibling relationship is exposed, Regina departs, leaving Oswald in anguish. He asks his mother to help him avoid the late stages of syphilis with a fatalmorphineoverdose. She agrees, but only if it becomes necessary. The play concludes with Mrs. Alving having to confront the decision of whether or not toeuthanizeher son in accordance with his wishes.[3]

As with his other plays,Henrik IbsenwroteGhostsin Danish, the common written language of Denmark and Norway at the time. The original title, in both Danish and Norwegian, isGengangere, which can be literally translated as ""again walkers"", ""ones who return"", or ""revenants"".[7]It has a double meaning of both ""ghosts"" and ""events that repeat themselves"" which the English titleGhostsfails to capture.

Ibsen wroteGhostsduring the autumn of 1881 and published it that December.[10]As early as November 1880, when he was living in Rome, he had been meditating on a new play to followA Doll's House. When he went toSorrento, in the summer of 1881, he was hard at work upon it. He finished it by the end of November 1881[11]and published it inCopenhagenon 13 December 1881.

Ghostswas published in Copenhagen on 13 December 1881 in an edition of 10,000 copies.[2]It caused a firestorm of public outcry,[2]and most of the 10,000 copies did not sell, which was financially a severe blow for Ibsen.[2][12]A subsequent print run of the text was not published until 1894.[2]

The play was initially sent to a number of Nordic theaters, including the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, the Nya Teatern and Dramaten in Stockholm, and the Christiania Theater, but all of them rejected the play.[2]In the early 1880s, the play was generally rejected by all major European playhouses, including those in Norway.[12]

Upon the publication of the text,[2]Ibsen's contemporaries found the play shocking and indecent and disliked its frank treatment of the forbidden topic ofvenereal disease. At the time, the mere mention of venereal disease was scandalous, and to show that a person who followed society's ideals of morality was at risk from her own husband was considered beyond the pale. According to Richard Eyre, ""There was an outcry of indignation against the attack on religion, the defence of free love, the mention of incest and syphilis.""[9]

Ghostspremiered in May 1882 in the United States, produced in Danish for Scandinavian immigrants by a Danish-Norwegian cast inChicago, at the Aurora Turner Hall.[2][13]The first performance in Sweden was atHelsingborgon 22 August 1883.[11]Ghostswas produced in Norway in October 1883, and it received good reviews.[2][9]It was produced independently in September 1889 at Berlin'sDie Freie Bühne.[14]

The play achieved a single private London performance on 13 March 1891 at theRoyalty Theatre, which was its English-language premiere.[13]The issue ofLord Chamberlain's Officecensorship, because of the subject matter of illegitimate children and sexually transmitted disease, was avoided by the formation of a subscription-onlyIndependent Theatre Societyto produce the play. Its members included playwrightGeorge Bernard Shawand authorsThomas HardyandHenry James.[15]The play was reviled in the press. In a typical review at the time,The Daily Telegraphreferred to it as ""Ibsen's positively abominable play entitledGhosts.... An open drain: a loathsome sore unbandaged; a dirty act done publicly.... A lazar house with all its doors and windows open ... Gross, almost putrid indecorum.... Literary carrion.... Crapulous stuff"".[16]

In 1898 when Ibsen was presented to KingOscar IIof Sweden and Norway, at a dinner in Ibsen's honour, the King told Ibsen thatGhostswas not a good play. After a pause, Ibsen exploded, ""Your Majesty, Ihadto writeGhosts!""[17][18][19]Ghostshad its first New York City production, and its first English-language production in the U.S., onBroadwayon 5 January 1894 at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre.[20][21]It was produced again in 1899 by the New York Independent Theatre withMary Shawas Mrs. Alving.[11]

Russian actressAlla Nazimova, with Paul Orleneff, gave a notable production ofGhostsin a small room on theLower East Sidein 1895–96.[11]When Nazimova had been a student in Russia, she had wanted to ""play Regina for my graduation piece at the dramatic school at Moscow, but they would not let me.Ghostswas at that time prohibited by the censor, because it reflects on the Church.""[11]

The play later received many European performances. In its 1906 production in Berlin, the Norwegian artistEdvard Munchwas commissioned to create the original stage designs.[22]On 4 May 1962, the play was performed in the Theatre Sala Chopin in Mexico City with Mexican actress and Hollywood starDolores del Ríoin the role of Mrs. Alving.[23]

A touring UK production, designed by Simon Higlett and inspired by Edvard Munch's original stage designs for a 1906 staging in Berlin, began performances atRose Theatre Kingstonin the United Kingdom on 19 September 2013, prior to an official opening on 25 September. Directed byStephen Unwin, the cast includedPatrick Druryas Pastor Manders, Florence Hall as Regina,Kelly Hunteras Mrs Alving, and Mark Quartley as Oswald.[22]

An award-winning 2013–14 London production opened at theAlmeida Theatreon 26 September 2013 and transferred to theWest EndatTrafalgar Studioson 9 December, running until 22 March 2014.[26]Adapted and directed byRichard Eyre, it featuredLesley Manville,Jack Lowden,Will Keen,Charlene McKenna, andBrian McCardie.

In 2014 a Chinese-Norwegian co-production entitledGhosts 2.0was produced in Beijing, commissioned by Ibsen International and directed byWang Chong, who had started the Chinese New Wave Theater Movement. The multimedia performance used four cameras on the stage, giving the audience different perspectives.[37][38]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1450,Pollyanna,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollyanna,"The title character isPollyanna Whittier, an eleven-year-oldorphanwho goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville,Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and coldspinsterAunt Polly Harrington, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it is her duty to her late sister Jennie. Pollyanna's philosophy of life centers on what she calls ""The Glad Game"", anoptimisticand positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident oneChristmaswhen Pollyanna, who was hoping for adollin the missionary barrel, found only a pair ofcrutchesinside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at the good side of things—in this case, to be glad about the crutches because she did not need to use them.

With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt's dispiritedNew Englandtown that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live. The Glad Game shields her from her aunt's stern attitude: when Aunt Polly puts her in a stuffy attic room without carpets or pictures, she exults at the beautiful view from the high window; when she tries to ""punish"" her niece for being late to dinner by sentencing her to a meal of bread and milk in the kitchen with the servant Nancy, Pollyanna thanks her rapturously because she likes bread and milk, and she likes Nancy.

Soon Pollyanna teaches some of Beldingsville's most troubled inhabitants to ""play the game"" as well, from Mrs. Snow, a querulous invalid, to Mr. Pendleton, a miserly bachelor who lives all alone in a cluttered mansion. Aunt Polly, too—finding herself helpless before Pollyanna's buoyant refusal to be downcast—gradually begins to thaw, although she resists the Glad Game longer than anyone else.

Eventually, however, even Pollyanna's robust optimism is put to the test when she is struck by a car and loses the use of her legs. At first, she does not realize the seriousness of her situation, but her spirits plummet when she is told what happened to her. After that, she lies in bed, unable to find anything to be glad about. Then the townspeople begin calling at Aunt Polly's house, eager to let Pollyanna know how much her encouragement has improved their lives; and Pollyanna decides she can still be glad that she at least had her legs. The novel ends with Aunt Polly marrying her former lover Dr. Chilton and Pollyanna being sent to a hospital, where she learns to walk again and is able to appreciate the use of her legs far more as a result of being temporarilydisabledand unable to walk well.

As a result of the novel's success, the adjective ""Pollyannaish"" and the noun ""Pollyannaism""[2]became popular terms for a personality type characterised by irrepressible optimism evident in the face of even the most adverse or discouraging of circumstances. It is sometimes usedpejoratively, referring to someone whose optimism is excessive to the point ofnaïvetéorrefusing to acceptthe facts of an unfortunate situation. This pejorative use can be heard in the introduction of the 1930GeorgeandIra Gershwinsong ""But Not For Me"": ""I never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas/who tell me fate supplies a mate/that's all bananas"" (performed by Judy Garland in the 1943 movieGirl Crazy).[3]

The word ""pollyanna"" may also be used colloquially to denote a holiday gift exchange more typically known asSecret Santa, especially inPhiladelphiaand the surrounding areas.[4]

At the height of her popularity, Pollyanna was known as ""The Glad Girl"", andParker Brotherseven createdThe Glad Game, aboard game.[5]The Glad Game, a type ofParcheesi, was made and sold from 1915 to 1967 in various versions, similar to the popular UK board gameLudo.[6]The board game was later licensed byParker Brothersbut has been discontinued for many years.[citation needed]ABroadwayadaptation was mounted in 1916 titledPollyanna Whittier, The Glad Girl.[7]Helen Hayeswas the star.[8]

Author Jerome (Jerry) Griswold analysed Pollyanna together with juvenile 'heroes' in several well-known children's books, e.g.,Little Lord Fauntleroy,Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm(both also portrayed by Pickford on film) andThe Secret Gardenfrom the era known as the Golden Age of Children's Books (approximately the American Civil War to World War I). With reference to theTheory of the Three Lives of the Child Hero, he posits that, inPollyanna, clearoedipaltensions exist, albeit in disguised or projected forms, in the relationships between the child, her Aunt and the principal male adult characters, which are only resolved by the Aunt marrying Dr. Chilton at the end of the story. He callsPollyanna'a complex novel replete with disguises' and sees Pollyanna, not as a naïve child but, rather, as a gifted individual with the ability to direct her extreme optimism and good-naturedness (for the good) towards the manipulating of the negative, worldly, cynical or disillusioned emotions of the adults that inhabit her life.[9]

""Glad Clubs"" appear to have been popular for a while; however, it is questionable if they were ever more than a publicity gimmick.[10]Glad Clubs may have been simply a means to popularizeThe Glad Gameas a method forcopingwith the vicissitudes of life such as loss, disappointment, and distress. Nevertheless, at least one ""glad club"" existed as recently as 2008, inDenver,Colorado.[11]

In 2002 the citizens ofLittleton, New Hampshireunveiled a bronzestatuein honor ofEleanor H. Porter, author of the Pollyanna books and one of the town's most famous residents. The statue depicts a smiling Pollyanna, arms flung wide in greeting. Littleton also hosts a festival known as ""The Official Pollyanna Glad Day"" every summer.[12]

The celebrated American science fiction writerRay Bradburydescribed himself as ""Janus, the two-faced god who is half Pollyanna and halfCassandra, warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past—a combination of both"".[13]

In a 1973 State of the Union message to Congress Richard M. Nixon wrote, ""I believe there is always a sensible middle ground between the Cassandras and the Pollyannas. We must take our stand upon that ground.""[14]

The video game seriesMother(marketed in the U.S. asEarthBound) has consistently featured variations of a certain song, which in its first incarnation was calledPollyanna. The title is a reference to the novel, and a lyrical version released on the game's officialarranged soundtrack CDis told from the perspective of a woman who would gladly be""called Pollyanna"", or otherwise be considered foolish in her unyielding optimism.[15]

In 1915,Catherine Chisholm CushingpublishedPollyanna: The Glad Girl, a four-act comedy which was produced with great success in Philadelphia starringPatricia Collingeas Pollyanna.  A critic at the time wrote that: ""Mrs. Cushing has slashed and sliced and revised and twisted the story of Pollyanna and her infectious gladness until it has become swift-moving, intensely dramatic and very real.""[16]In 1918 and 1919 the play toured the U.S. and Canada with 19-year-old Viola Harper (née Harpman) in the title role.[17]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/131,The Pilgrim's Progress from this world to that which is to come,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilgrim%27s_Progress,"The entire book is presented as adream sequencenarrated by anomniscient narrator. The allegory's protagonist, Christian, is aneverymancharacter, and the plot centres on his journey from his hometown, the ""City of Destruction"" (""this world""), to the ""Celestial City"" (""that which is to come"":Heaven) atop MountZion. Christian is weighed down by a great burden—the knowledge of his sin—which he believed came from his reading ""the book in his hand"" (theBible). This burden, which would cause him to sink into Hell, is so unbearable that Christian must seek deliverance. He meets Evangelist as he is walking out in the fields, who directs him to the ""Wicket Gate"" for deliverance. Since Christian cannot see the ""Wicket Gate"" in the distance, Evangelist directs him to go to a ""shining light"", which Christian thinks he sees.[16]Christian leaves his home, his wife, and children to save himself: he cannot persuade them to accompany him. Obstinate and Pliable go after Christian to bring him back, but Christian refuses. Obstinate returns disgusted, but Pliable is persuaded to go with Christian, hoping to take advantage of the Paradise that Christian claims lies at the end of his journey. Pliable's journey with Christian is cut short when the two of them fall into theSlough of Despond, a boggy mire-like swamp where pilgrims' doubts, fears, temptations, lusts, shames, guilts, and sins of their present condition of being a sinner are used to sink them into the mud of the swamp. It is there in that bog where Pliable abandons Christian after getting himself out. After struggling to the other side of the slough, Christian is pulled out by Help, who has heard his cries and tells him the swamp is made out of the decadence, scum, and filth of sin, but the ground is good at the narrow Wicket Gate.

On his way to the Wicket Gate, Christian is diverted by thesecular ethicsof Mr. Worldly Wiseman into seeking deliverance from his burden through the Law, supposedly with the help of a Mr. Legality and his son Civility in the village of Morality, rather than through Christ, allegorically by way of the Wicket Gate. Evangelist meets the wayward Christian as he stops beforeMount Sinaion the way to Mr. Legality's home. It hangs over the road and threatens to crush any who would pass it; also the mountain flashes with fire. Evangelist exposes Worldly Wiseman, Legality, and Civility for the frauds they are: they would have the pilgrim leave the true path by trusting in his own good deeds to remove his burden. Evangelist directs Christian to return to the way to the Wicket Gate, and Christian complies.

At the Wicket Gate begins the ""straight and narrow"" King's Highway, and Christian is directed onto it by the gatekeeper Goodwill who saves him from Beelzebub's archers at Beelzebub's castle near the Wicket Gate and shows him the heavenly way he must go. In the Second Part, Goodwill is shown to beJesusHimself.[17]To Christian's query about relief from his burden, Goodwill directs him forward to ""the place of deliverance"".[14][18]

Christian makes his way from there to the House of the Interpreter, where he is shown pictures andtableauxthat portray or dramatize aspects of the Christian faith and life. Roger Sharrock denotes them ""emblems"".[14][19]

From the House of the Interpreter, Christian finally reaches the ""place of deliverance"" (allegorically, the cross ofCalvaryand the opensepulchre of Christ), where the ""straps"" that bound Christian's burden to him break, and it rolls away into the open sepulchre. This event happens relatively early in the narrative: the immediate need of Christian at the beginning of the story is quickly remedied. After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three angels, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City. Encouraged by all this, Christian happily continues his journey until he comes upon three men named Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. Christian tries to help them, but they disregard his advice. Before coming to the Hill of Difficulty, Christian meets two well-dressed men named Formality and Hypocrisy who prove to be false Christians that perish in the two dangerous bypasses near the hill, named Danger and Destruction. Christian falls asleep at the arbour above the hill and loses his scroll, forcing him to go back and get it. Near the top of the Hill of Difficulty, he meets two weak pilgrims named Mistrust and Timorous who tell him of the great lions of the Palace Beautiful. Christian fearfully avoids the lions through Watchful the porter who tells them that they are chained and put there to test the faith of pilgrims.

Atop the Hill of Difficulty, Christian makes his first stop for the night at the House of the Palace Beautiful, which is a place built by God for the refreshment of pilgrims and godly travellers. Christian spends three days here, and leaves clothed with the Armour of God (Eph. 6:11–18),[20]which stands him in good stead in his battle against the demonic dragon-likeApollyon(the lord and god of the City of Destruction) in the Valley of Humiliation. This battle lasts ""over half a day"" until Christian manages to wound and stab Apollyon with his two-edged sword (a reference to the Bible, Heb. 4:12).[21]""And with that Apollyon spread his dragon wings and sped away.""

As night falls, Christian enters the fearful Valley of the Shadow of Death. When he is in the middle of the Valley amidst the gloom, terror, and demons, he hears the words of theTwenty-third Psalm, spoken possibly by his friend Faithful:

As he leaves this valley the sun rises on a new day.

Just outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful, also a former resident of the City of Destruction, who accompanies him to Vanity Fair, a place built by Beelzebub where every thing to a human's taste, delight, and lust is sold daily, where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the Fair. Faithful is put on trial and executed by burning at the stake as a martyr. A celestial chariot then takes Faithful to the Celestial City, martyrdom being a shortcut there. Hopeful, a resident of Vanity Fair, takes Faithful's place to be Christian's companion for the rest of the way.

Christian and Hopeful then come to a hill called Lucre where there is a silver mine. A man called Demas urges them to join in the mining going on, but Christian sees through Demas's trickery and they avoid the mine. Afterward, a false pilgrim named By-Ends and his friends, who followed Christian and Hopeful only to take advantage of them, perish at the Hill Lucre, never to be seen or heard from again. On a rough, stony stretch of road, Christian and Hopeful leave the highway to travel on the easier By-Path Meadow, where a rainstorm forces them to spend the night. In the morning they are captured by Giant Despair, who is known for his savage cruelty, and his wife Diffidence; the pilgrims are taken to the Giant's Doubting Castle, where they are imprisoned, beaten and starved. The Giant and the Giantess want them to commitsuicide, but they endure the ordeal until Christian realizes that a key he has, called Promise, will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle. Using the key and the Giant's vulnerability to sunlight, they escape.

The Delectable Mountains form the next stage of Christian and Hopeful's journey, where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as ""Immanuel's Land"". The pilgrims are shown sights that strengthen their faith and warn them against sinning, like the Hill Error or the Mountain Caution. On Mount Clear, they are able to see the Celestial City through the shepherd's ""perspective glass"", which serves as a telescope. (This device is given to Mercy in the Second Part at her request.) The shepherds tell the pilgrims to beware of the Flatterer and to avoid the Enchanted Ground. Soon they come to a crossroad and a man dressed in white comes to help them. Thinking he is a ""shining one"" (angel), the pilgrims follow the man, but soon get stuck in a net and realize their so-called angelic guide was the Flatterer. A true shining one comes and frees them from the net. The Angel punishes them for following the Flatterer and then puts them back on the right path. The pilgrims meet an Atheist, who tells them Heaven and God do not exist, but Christian and Hopeful remember the shepherds and pay no attention to the man. Christian and Hopeful come to a place where a man named Wanton Professor is chained by the ropes of seven demons who take him to a shortcut to the Lake of Fire (Hell). This reminds them of a man named Little Faith, who had been mugged by thieves that stole his spending money and resulted in him having a hard life, although the thieves did not take Little Faith's scroll or his jewels, which he kept safe through his journey.

On the way, Christian and Hopeful meet a lad named Ignorance, who believes that he will be allowed into the Celestial City through his own good deeds rather than as a gift of God's grace. Christian and Hopeful meet up with him twice and try to persuade him to journey to the Celestial City in the right way. Ignorance persists in his own way that he thinks will lead him into Heaven. After getting over the River of Death on the ferry boat of Vain Hope without overcoming the hazards of wading across it, Ignorance appears before the gates of Celestial City without a passport, which he would have acquired had he gone into the King's Highway through the Wicket Gate. The Lord of the Celestial City orders the shining ones (angels) to take Ignorance to one of the byways of Hell and throw him in.

Christian and Hopeful, with deep discourse about the truth of their glorious salvation, manage to make it through the dangerous Enchanted Ground (a place where the air makes them sleepy and if they fall asleep, they never wake up) into the Land of Beulah, where they ready themselves to cross the dreaded River of Death on foot to Mount Zion and the Celestial City. Christian has a rough time of it because of his past sins wearing him down, but Hopeful helps him over, and they are welcomed into the Celestial City.

The Second Part ofThe Pilgrim's Progresspresents the pilgrimage of Christian's wife, Christiana, and their sons, and the maiden, Mercy. They visit the same stopping places that Christian visited, with the addition of Gaius' Inn between the Valley of the Shadow of Death and Vanity Fair, but they take a longer time in order to accommodate marriage andchildbirthfor the four sons and their wives. Theheroof the story is Greatheart, a servant of the Interpreter, who is the pilgrims' guide to the Celestial City. He kills four giants called Giant Grim, Giant Maul, Giant Slay-Good, and Giant Despair and participates in the slaying of a monster called Legion that terrorizes the city of Vanity Fair.

When Christiana's party leaves Gaius's Inn and Mr. Feeble-Mind lingers in order to be left behind, he is encouraged to accompany the party by Greatheart. Christiana, Matthew, Samuel, Joseph, James, Mercy, Greatheart, Old Mr. Honest, Mr. Feeble-Mind, Mr. Ready-To-Halt, Phoebe, Grace, and Martha come to Bypath-Meadow and, after much fight and difficulty, slay the cruel Giant Despair and the wicked Giantess Diffidence, and demolish Doubting Castle for Christian and Hopeful who were oppressed there. They free a pale man named Mr. Despondency and his daughter named Much-Afraid from the castle's dungeons.

When the pilgrims end up in the Land of Beulah, they cross over the River of Death by appointment. As a matter of importance to Christians of Bunyan's persuasion reflected in the narrative ofThe Pilgrim's Progress, the last words of the pilgrims as they cross over the River of Death are recorded. The four sons of Christian and their families do not cross but remain for the support of the church in that place.

Scholars have pointed out that Bunyan may have been influenced in the creation of places inThe Pilgrim's Progressby his own surrounding environment. Albert Foster[22]describes the natural features ofBedfordshirethat apparently turn up inThe Pilgrim's Progress.Vera Brittainin her thoroughly researched biography of Bunyan,[23]identifies seven locations that appear in theallegory. Other connections are suggested in books not directly associated with either John Bunyan orThe Pilgrim's Progress.[citation needed]

At least twenty-one natural or man-made geographical or topographical features fromThe Pilgrim's Progresshave been identified—places and structures John Bunyan regularly would have seen as a child and, later, in his travels on foot or horseback. The entire journey from The City of Destruction to the Celestial City may have been based on Bunyan's own usual journey fromBedford, on the main road that runs less than a mile behind his cottage inElstow, throughAmpthill,DunstableandSt Albans, to London.

In the same sequence as these subjects appear inThe Pilgrim's Progress, the geographical realities are as follows:

The Pilgrim's Progresswas much more popular than its predecessors. Bunyan's plain style breathes life into the abstractions of theanthropomorphizedtemptations and abstractions that Christian encounters and with whom he converses on his course to Heaven.[according to whom?]Samuel Johnsonsaid that ""this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing"". Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted incolonial America, and was widely read in thePuritancolonies. The book was often divided into smaller parts or individual episodes that could be made into individual sermons, postcards, or wall charts. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Religious Tract Society produced the book into Sunday School prize editions and cheap abridgments. There were also Bunyan inspired jigsaw puzzles, and some followers crafted their landscapes in Bunyan theme parks.[9]

Because of its English Protestant theology,The Pilgrim's Progressshares the then-popular English antipathy toward theCatholic Church. It was published over the years of thePopish Plot(1678–1681) and ten years before theGlorious Revolutionof 1688, and it shows the influence ofJohn Foxe'sActs and Monuments. Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named ""Pope"":

When Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair, Bunyan adds the editorial comment:

In the Second Part, while Christiana and her group of pilgrims led by Greatheart stay for some time in Vanity, the city is terrorized by a seven-headed beast[45]which is driven away by Greatheart and other stalwarts.[46]In his endnotes, W. R. Owens notes about the woman that governs the beast: ""This woman was believed by Protestants to represent Antichrist, the Church of Rome. In a posthumously published treatise,Of Antichrist, and his Ruine(1692), Bunyan gave an extended account of the rise and (shortly expected) fall of Antichrist.""[47]

""The Pilgrim's Progresshas been translated into 200 languages"", including Dutch in 1681, German in 1703, and Swedish in 1727, as well as over eighty African languages.[which?][48]In 1681, the first North American edition was issued. In addition, there were nine translations in Southeast Asia, twenty four translations in South Asia, and another eleven in Australasia and the Pacific.[49]Beginning in the 1850s, illustrated versions ofThe Pilgrim's Progressin Chinese were printed inHong Kong,ShanghaiandFuzhouand widely distributed by Protestant missionaries.Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Christianity-inspiredTaiping Rebellion, declared that the book was his favorite reading.[50]

Henry Alfred Krishnapillai'smagnum opus,Ratchanya Yaathrigam(The Journey of Salvation) is an adaptation ofThe Pilgrim's Progressin theTamil languageand is considered one of the finest Tamil literary works of the 19th century.Paradeshi Mokshayathraby Rev.K. Koshy/Rev. Joseph Peet (1844), andSanchariyude Prayanam(1846) by Rev. C. Muller/Rev. P. Chandran are allegorical translations inMalayalamand are one of theearliest prose worksin the language.[51]

In Turkish, translations of the book appeared in Greek script in 1879, and in Armenian script in 1881.

The literal textual meaning ofThe Pilgrim's Progresswas also adapted by young converts and missionaries to make sense in different cultural contexts.[49]""For example, Kele Protestants in the Congo omitted the sections that explained original sin"" since ""this idea was incompatible with their cultural assumptions.""[49]The Pilgrim's Progresswas also adapted to be relevant for non-Europeans, by tailoring the story to make sense of their own experiences. Heaven was often a place designed to resemble what they had gone through in life. For example, in the American Southern Black culture, Bunyan was changed to be a black protagonist who ""was redeemed not only from sin but also slavery.""[49]Similarly, a version was written where theinjustices which took placein South Africa were reformulated.[52]

There are collections of old foreign language versions ofThe Pilgrim's Progressat both theMoot Hall Museumin Elstow, and at theJohn Bunyan Museumin Mill Street in Bedford.

The Third Part of the Pilgrim's Progresswas written by an anonymous author; beginning in 1693, it was published with Bunyan's authentic two parts. It continued to be republished with Bunyan's work until 1852.[53]This third part presented the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions.

The book was the basis of a condensed radio adaptation, originally presented in 1942 and starringJohn Gielgud, which included, as background music, several excerpts fromRalph Vaughan Williams' orchestral works.[citation needed]

The book was the basis ofThe Pilgrim's Progress(opera)by Vaughan Williams, premiered in 1951.

The radio version was newly recorded byHyperion Recordsin 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best. It again starred Gielgud, and featuredRichard PascoandUrsula Howells.[citation needed]

English composerErnest Austinset the whole story as a hugenarrativetone poemfor soloorgan, with optional 6-partchoirandnarrator, lasting approximately2+1⁄2hours.[when?][citation needed]

Under the nameThe Similitude of a Dream, the progressive rock band ofNeal Morsereleased a concept album based onThe Pilgrim's Progressin November 2016. A sequel, entitledThe Great Adventure, focusing on Christian's son Joseph, was released in January 2019. Both albums received critical acclaim.

A number of illustrations created by Henry Melville appear in the Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books under the editorship ofLetitia Elizabeth Landon. Each is accompanied by a poem, either byBernard Bartonor by Miss Landon herself. These plates are as follows:

The Pilgrim's Progresswas a favourite subject among painters in 1840s America, including major figures of theHudson River Schooland others associated with theNational Academy of Design.Daniel Huntington,Jasper Cropsey,Frederic Edwin Church,Jesse Talbot,Edward Harrison May, and others completed canvases based on the work.Thomas Cole'sThe Voyage of Lifewas inspired byThe Pilgrim's Progress.[63]

In 1850, Huntington, Cropsey, and Church contributed designs to amoving panoramabased onThe Pilgrim's Progress, conceptualized by May and fellow artist Joseph Kyle, which debuted in New York and travelled all over the country.[64]A second version of the panorama, organized by Kyle and artist Jacob Dallas, premiered in 1851.[65]The second version exists today in the collections of theSaco Museum.

InWole Soyinka's novelChronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth(2021), the third chapter is entitled 'Pilgrim's Progress'. In describes the travels of the character Dennis Tibidje. He encounters John Bunyan's bookPilgrim's Progresswhile detained as an illegal immigrant in New Jersey.

Charles Dickens' bookOliver Twist(1838) is subtitled 'The Parish Boy's Progress'. The titular character ofThe Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby(1839) and his companion Smike start to read it but are interrupted.

The title ofWilliam Makepeace Thackeray's 1847–1848 novelVanity Fairalludes to the location in Bunyan's work.

Mark Twaingave his 1869 travelogue,The Innocents Abroad, the alternative titleThe New Pilgrims' Progress. In Twain's later workAdventures of Huckleberry Finn,the titular charactermentionsThe Pilgrim's Progressas he describes the works of literature in the Grangerfords' library. Twain uses this to satirize the Protestant Southern aristocracy.

E. E. Cummingsmakes numerous references to it in his prose work,The Enormous Room.

Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, ""The Celestial Railroad"", recreates Christian's journey in Hawthorne's time. Progressive thinkers have replaced the footpath by a railroad, and pilgrims may now travel under steam power. The journey is considerably faster, but somewhat more questionable. Hawthorne's novelThe Scarlet Letteralso makes reference to it, by way of the authorJohn Bunyanwith a metaphor comparing a main character's eyes with the fire depicted in the entrance to Hell inThe Pilgrim's Progress.

John Buchanwas an admirer of Bunyan's, andPilgrim's Progressfeatures significantly in his thirdRichard Hannaynovel,Mr. Standfast, which also takes its title from one of Bunyan's characters.

Alan Moore, in hisLeague of Extraordinary Gentlemen, enlistsThe Pilgrim's Progressprotagonist, Christian, as a member of the earliest version of this group,Prospero's Men, having become wayward on his journey during his visit in Vanity Fair, stepping down an alleyway and found himself in London in the 1670s, and unable to return to his homeland. This group disbanded in 1690 after Prospero vanished into theBlazing World; however, some parts of the text seem to imply that Christian resigned from Prospero's League before its disbanding and that Christian travelled to the Blazing World before Prospero himself. The apparent implication is that; within the context of the League stories; the Celestial City Christian seeks and the Blazing World may in fact be one and the same.[citation needed]

InLouisa May Alcott'sLittle Women, the protagonist Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the novel, and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times toPilgrim's Progressand liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. A number of chapter titles directly reference characters and places fromPilgrim's Progress.

The cartoonistWinsor McCaydrew an allegorical comic strip, entitledA Pilgrim's Progress, in theNew York Evening Telegram. The strip ran from 26 June 1905 to 18 December 1910. In it, the protagonist Mr. Bunion is constantly frustrated in his attempts to improve his life by ridding himself of his burdensome valise, ""Dull Care"".[66]

C. S. Lewiswrote a book inspired byThe Pilgrim's Progress, calledThe Pilgrim's Regress, in which a character named John follows a vision to escape from The Landlord, a less friendly version of The Owner inThe Pilgrim's Regress. It is an allegory of C. S. Lewis' own journey from a religious childhood to a pagan adulthood in which he rediscovers his Christian God.

Henry Williamson'sThe Patriot's Progressreferences the title ofThe Pilgrim's Progressand the symbolic nature of John Bunyan's work. The protagonist of thesemi-autobiographicalnovel is John Bullock, the quintessential English soldier during World War I.

The character ofBilly PilgriminKurt Vonnegut's novelSlaughterhouse-5: The Children's Crusadeis a clear homage to a similar journey to enlightenment experienced by Christian, although Billy's journey leads him to anexistentialacceptance of life and of afatalisthuman condition. Vonnegut's parallel toThe Pilgrim's Progressis deliberate and evident in Billy's surname.

Charlotte Brontërefers toPilgrim's Progressin most of her novels, includingJane Eyre,[67]Shirley,[68]andVillette.[69]Her alterations to the quest-narrative have led to much critical interest, particular with the ending ofJane Eyre.[70]

Walt WillisandBob Shaw's classicscience fiction fannovelette,The Enchanted Duplicator, is explicitly modeled onThe Pilgrim's Progressand has been repeatedly reprinted over the decades since its first appearance in 1954: inprofessional publications, infanzines, and as amonograph.

Enid BlytonwroteThe Land of Far Beyond(1942) as a children's version ofThe Pilgrim's Progress.

John Steinbeck's novelThe Grapes of WrathmentionsThe Pilgrim's Progressas one of an (anonymous) character's favorite books. Steinbeck's novel was itself an allegorical spiritual journey by Tom Joad through America during theGreat Depression, and often made Christian allusions to sacrifice and redemption in a world of social injustice.

The book was commonly referenced in African Americanslave narratives, such as ""Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom"" byEllen and William Craft, to emphasize the moral and religious implications of slavery.[71]

Hannah Hurnard's novelHinds' Feet on High Places(1955) uses a similar allegorical structure toThe Pilgrim's Progressand takes Bunyan's character Much-Afraid as its protagonist.

InLois McMaster Bujold'sThe Borders of Infinity(1989),Miles Vorkosiganuses half a page torn fromThe Pilgrim's Progressas a coded message to his fleet to rescue him and 9,000 others from a POW camp.

Sir Walter Scottuses Bunyan's tale in chapter 32 of his novelThe Heart of Midlothian(1818) to illustrate the relationship between Madge Wildfire andJeanie Deans. Madge explains: ""But it is all over now.—But we'll knock at the gate and then the keeper will admit Christiana, but Mercy will be left out—and then I'll stand at the door trembling and crying, and then Christiana—that's you, Jeanie,—will intercede for me. And then Mercy,—that's me, ye ken,—will faint[.]""

InMarguerite Young's novel,Miss MacIntosh, My Darling, the titular character always carries a copy ofPilgrim's Progresswith her. The structure of the novel is inspired byPilgrim's Progresstoo, being composed largely of the narrator's seemingly omniscient reminiscences about other characters' inner lives and dreams.

InGeorge Eliot's novelMiddlemarch, a lengthy quotation from the conclusion of the trial of Faithful in Vanity Fair serves as the epigraph to Chapter 85."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2911,Justice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_(play),"The play opens in the offices of James How & Sons,solicitors. A young woman appears at the door, with children in tow, asking to see the junior clerk, William Falder, on a personal matter. She is Ruth Honeywill, Falder’s married sweetheart with whom he is planning to elope to save her from brutality and possible death at the hands of her drunken husband. After Robert Cokeson, the senior clerk, discovers that a cheque he had issued for nine pounds has been altered to read ninety, Falder confesses to the forgery, pleading a moment of madness. Realising that he must be in some sort of predicament in connection with the young woman, Cokeson shows considerable sympathy, as does the firm’s junior partner, Walter How. But the senior partner James How does not, and turns Falder over to the police.

The opening of the second act takes place in court, at Falder’s trial. He is defended by a young advocate, Hector Frome, who — while not attempting to deny that his client did indeed alter the cheque — pleads temporary aberration and argues that Falder was attempting to deal with a situation in which the woman he loved could obtain no protection from the law: either she had to stay with her husband, in terror of her life, or she could seek a separation (mere brutality not being a legal ground for divorce) in which case she would end up in theworkhouseor on the streets selling her body in order to support her children. He pleads with the jury not to ruin the young man’s life by condemning him to prison. Falder is convicted and is sentenced to three years’penal servitude.

Cokeson visits Falder’s prison asking if Ruth might be allowed to see the prisoner, but receives no sympathy. Ruth tells Cokeson that she has left her husband and that she is destitute and unable to support herself or her children.

Falder adapts to incarceration poorly, and at the end of his sentence leaves prison a broken man. Ruth and he appear at the solicitors’ offices, and Ruth pleads with the partners to give Falder a chance and to take him back. The partners express their willingness reluctantly, but on condition that he give up Ruth entirely. At this point Falder, horrified, realises that she has managed to survive in his absence only by selling herself.

A policeman arrives to arrest Falder for failing to report to the authorities as aticket-of-leave man. Overcome by the inexorability of his fate, Falder throws himself out of an upstairs window, falling to his death. The play ends with the words of the senior clerk who has tried so hard to help him, ""No one'll touch him now! Never again! He's safe with gentle Jesus!"""

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/932,The Fall of the House of Usher,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher,"The story begins with the unnamed narrator arriving at the house of his childhood friend, Roderick Usher, having received a letter from him in a distant part of the country, complaining of an illness and asking for his help. As he arrives, the narrator notices a thin crack extending from the roof, down the front of the house and into the adjacenttarn, or lake.

It is revealed that Roderick's sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls intocataleptic, deathlike trances. Roderick and Madeline are the only remaining members of the Usher family.

The narrator is impressed with Roderick's paintings and attempts to cheer him by reading with him and listening to his improvised musical compositions on the guitar. Roderick sings ""The Haunted Palace"", then tells the narrator that he believes the house he lives in to be alive, and that this sentience arises from the arrangement of the masonry and vegetation surrounding it. Further, Roderick believes that his fate is connected to the family mansion.

Roderick later informs the narrator that Madeline has died. Fearing that her body will beexhumedfor medical study, Roderick insists that she be entombed for two weeks in thefamily tomblocated in the house before being permanently buried. The narrator helps Roderick put Madeline's body in the tomb, whereupon the narrator realizes that Madeline and Roderick are twins. The narrator also notes that Madeline's body has rosy cheeks,which sometimes happens after death. Over the next week, both Roderick and the narrator find themselves increasingly agitated.

A storm begins, and Roderick comes to the narrator's bedroom (which is situated directly above the house'svault) in an almosthysterical state. Throwing the windows open to the storm, Roderick points out that the lake surrounding the house seems to glow in the dark, just as Roderick depicted in his paintings, but there is no lightning or other explainable source of the glow.

The narrator attempts to calm Roderick by reading aloud from amedieval romanceentitledThe Mad Trist, a novel involving aknightnamed Ethelred who breaks into ahermit's dwellingin an attempt to escape an approaching storm, only to find a palace of gold guarded by adragon. Ethelred also finds a shining brass shield hanging on a wall. Upon the shield is inscribed:

Ethelred swings hismaceat the dragon, which dies with a piercing shriek. When he attempts to take the shield from the wall, it falls to the floor with an unnerving clatter.

As the narrator reads of the knight's forcible entry into the dwelling, he and Roderick hear cracking and ripping sounds from somewhere in the house. When the dragon's death cries are described, a real shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a hollow metallic reverberation can be heard throughout the house. At first, the narrator ignores the noises, but Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical. Roderick eventually declares that he has been hearing these sounds for days, and that they are being made by his sister, who was in factalive when she was entombed.

The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline, bloodied from her arduous escape from the tomb. In a final fit of rage, she attacks her brother,scaring him to deathas she herself expires. The narrator then runs from the house, and, as he does, he notices a flash of moonlight behind him. He turns back in time to see the Moon shining through the suddenly widened crack in the house. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink away into the lake.

In ""The Fall of the House of Usher"", Poe's unnamednarratoris called to visit the House of Usher by Roderick Usher. As his ""best and only friend,""[3]Roderick writes of his illness and asks that the narrator visit him. The narrator is persuaded by Roderick's desperation for companionship. Though sympathetic and helpful, the narrator is continually made to be an outsider, watching the narrative unfold without fully becoming a part of it. The narrator also exists as Roderick's audience as the men have not remained close. Roderick is convinced of his impending demise and the narrator is gradually drawn into this belief after being brought forth to witness the horrors and hauntings of the House of Usher.[4]

From his arrival, the narrator notes the family's isolationist tendencies, as well as the cryptic and special connection between Madeline and Roderick, the final living members of the Usher family. Throughout the tale and her varying states of consciousness, Madeline completely ignores the narrator's presence. After Roderick Usher claims that Madeline has died, the narrator helps Usher entomb Madeline in an underground vault despite noticing Madeline's flushed, lifelike appearance.

During one sleepless night, the narrator reads aloud to Usher as eerie sounds are heard throughout the mansion. He witnesses Madeline's reemergence and the subsequent, simultaneous death of the twins. The narrator is the only character to escape the House of Usher, which he views as it cracks and sinks into the mountain lake.

Roderick Usher is the twin of Madeline Usher and one of the last living members of the Usher family. Roderick writes to the narrator, his boyhood friend, about an ongoing illness.[3]When the narrator arrives, he is startled to see Roderick's eerie and off-putting appearance. He is described by the narrator as having:

Roderick Usher is arecluse.[3]He is unwell both physically and mentally. In addition to his constant fear and trepidation, Madeline's catalepsy contributes to his decay as he is tormented by the sorrow of watching his sibling die. The narrator states:

According to Terry W. Thompson, Roderick meticulously plans for Madeline's burial to prevent ""resurrection men"" from stealing his beloved sister's corpse fordissection, study, or experimentation as wascommon in the 18th and 19th centuriesfor medical schools and physicians in need of cadavers.[6]

Roderick and Madeline aretwinsand the two share an incommunicable connection that critics conclude may be eitherincestuousormetaphysical,[7]as two individuals in an extra-sensory relationship embodying a single entity. To that end, Roderick's deteriorating condition speeds his own torment and eventual death.

Like Madeline, Roderick is connected to the mansion, the titular House of Usher. He believes the mansion is sentient and responsible, in part, for his deteriorating mental health andmelancholy. Despite this admission, Usher remains in the mansion and composes art containing the Usher mansion or similarhaunted mansions. His mental health deteriorates faster as he begins to hear Madeline's attempts to escape the underground vault she was buried in, and he eventually meets hisdeath out of fearin a manner similar to the House of Usher's cracking and sinking.

Madeline Usher is the twin sister of Roderick Usher. She is deathly ill and cataleptic. She appears near the narrator, but never acknowledges his presence. She returns to her bedroom where Roderick claims she has died. The narrator and Roderick place her in a tomb despite her flushed, lively appearance. In the tale's conclusion, Madeline escapes from the tomb and returns to Roderick, scaring him to death.

According to Poe's detective methodology in literature, Madeline Usher may be the physical embodiment of the supernatural and metaphysical worlds.[citation needed]Her limited presence is explained as a personification of Roderick's torment and fear.[citation needed]Madeline does not appear until she is summoned through her brother's fear, foreshadowed in the epigraph, with a quote from French poetPierre-Jean de Béranger: ""Son cœur est un luth suspendu; / Sitôt qu'on le touche il résonne"", meaning ""His heart is a suspendedlute; as soon as one touches it, it resonates"".[citation needed]

""The Fall of the House of Usher"" was first published in September 1839 inBurton's Gentleman's Magazine. It was revised slightly in 1840 for the collectionTales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. It contains Poe's poem ""The Haunted Palace"", which earlier was published separately in the April 1839 issue ofBaltimore Museum.[8]

In 1928, Éditions Narcisse, predecessor to theBlack Sun Press, published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies with illustrations byAlastair.[citation needed]

Poe's inspiration for the story may be based upon events of the Hezekiah Usher House, which was located on the Usher estate that is now a three-block area in downtown modernBoston, Massachusetts.[9]Adjacent toBoston Commonand bounded by Tremont Street to the northwest, Washington Street to the southeast, Avery Street to the south and Winter Street to the north, the house was constructed in 1684 and either torn down or relocated in 1830.[9]Other sources indicate that a sailor and the young wife of the older owner were caught and entombed in their trysting spot by her husband. When the Usher House was torn down in 1830, two bodies were found embraced in a cavity in the cellar.[10]

Another source of inspiration may be from an actual couple, Mr. and Mrs. Luke Usher, the friends and acting colleagues of his motherEliza Poe.[11]The couple took care of Eliza's three children (including Poe) during her time of illness and eventual death.[citation needed]

German writerE.T.A. Hoffmann, who was a role model and inspiration for Poe, published the story ""Das Majorat"" in 1819.[citation needed]There are many similarities between the two stories, including the physical breaking of a house, eerie sounds in the night, thestory within a storyand the house owner being called Roderich or Roderick. Because Poe was familiar with Hoffmann's works, he knew the story and drew from it using the elements for his own purposes.[12]

Another German author,Heinrich Clauren's, 1812 story ""Das Raubschloß"", as translated into English byJoseph Hardmanand published inBlackwood's Magazinein 1828 as ""The Robber's Tower"", may have served as an inspiration, according toArno Schmidtand Thomas Hansen.[13]As well as its sharing common elements, such as a young woman with a fear of premature burial interred in asepulcherdirectly beneath the protagonist's chamber, stringed instruments, and the living twin of the buried girl, Diane Hoeveler identifies textual evidence of Poe's use of the story, and concludes that the inclusion ofVigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae(Vigils for the Dead according to the Use of the Church of Mainz) is drawn from the use of a similarly obscure book in ""The Robber's Tower"".[2][14]

The theme of the crumbling, haunted castle is a key feature ofHorace Walpole'sCastle of Otranto(1764), which largely contributed in defining theGothic genre.[15]

""The Fall of the House of Usher"" is considered the best example of Poe's ""totality"", wherein every element and detail is related and relevant.[16]

The presence of a capacious, disintegrating house symbolizing the destruction of the human body continues to be a characteristic element in Poe's later work.[15]

""The Fall of the House of Usher"" shows Poe's ability to create an emotional tone in his work, specifically emphasizing feelings offear, impending doom, andguilt.[17]These emotions center on Roderick Usher, who, like many Poe characters, suffers from an unnamed disease. Like the narrator in ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", this disease inflames Roderick'shyperactive senses. The illness manifests physically but is based in Roderick's mental or even moral state. He is sick, it is suggested, because he expects to be sick based on his family's history of illness and is, therefore, essentially ahypochondriac.[18]Similarly, he buries his sister alive because he expects to bury her alive, creating his ownself-fulfilling prophecy.[citation needed]

The House of Usher, itself doubly referring both to the actual structure and the family, plays a significant role in the story. It is the first ""character"" that the narrator introduces to the reader, presented with a humanized description: Its windows are described as ""eye-like"" twice in the first paragraph. The fissure that develops in its side is symbolic of the decay of the Usher family and the house ""dies"" along with the two Usher siblings. This connection was emphasized in Roderick's poem ""The Haunted Palace"", which seems to be a direct reference to the house that foreshadows doom.[19]

L. Sprague de Campin hisLovecraft: A Biographywrote that ""[a]ccording to the late [Poe expert]Thomas O. Mabbott,H.P. Lovecraft, in 'Supernatural Horror', solved a problem in the interpretation of Poe"" by arguing that ""Roderick Usher, his sister Madeline, and the house all shared one common soul"".[20]

The plot of this tale has prompted many critics to analyze it as a description of the human psyche, comparing, for instance, the House to the unconscious, and its central crack to asplit personality.[citation needed]An incestuous relationship between Roderick and Madeline never is explicitly stated, but may be implied by the attachment between the two siblings.[21]

Opium, which Poe mentions several times in both his prose and poems, is mentioned twice in the tale.[1]The gloomy sensation occasioned by the dreary landscape around the Usher mansion is compared by the narrator to the sickness caused by thewithdrawalsymptoms of an opiate-addict. The narrator also describes Roderick Usher's appearance as that of an ""irreclaimable eater of opium.""[22]

While there are no direct statements supporting their conclusions, scholars have demonstrated the language deployed by Roderick to describe his sister as full of hints of the possible incestuous relationship between the twins. They argue that this perversion is the actual cause of the fall of the house as well as an end to the lineage of Ushers.[23]

Usher's library is mentioned to have ""formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid [Roderick Usher]"". A list of titles is provided in the story, all of which are allusions to real-world works. Several notable examples include:

Along with ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", ""The Black Cat"", and ""The Cask of Amontillado"", ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" is considered among Poe's more famous works of prose.[27]As G.R. Thomson writes in his introduction toGreat Short Works of Edgar Allan Poe, ""the tale has long been hailed as a masterpiece of Gothic horror; it is also a masterpiece of dramatic irony and structural symbolism"".[28]

""The Fall of the House of Usher"" has been criticized for being too formulaic, particularly in how Poe followed patterns established in his own works like ""Morella"" and ""Ligeia"", using stock characters in stock scenes and stock situations. Repetitive themes like an unidentifiable disease, madness, and resurrection are also criticized.[29]Washington Irvingexplained to Poe in a letter dated November 6, 1839: ""You have been too anxious to present your pictures vividly to the eye, or too distrustful of your effect, and had laid on too much colouring. It is erring on the best side – the side of luxuriance"".[30]

John McAleer maintained thatHerman Melville's idea for ""objectifyingAhab's flawed character"" inMoby-Dickcame from the ""evocative force"" of Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher"". In both Ahab and the house of Usher, the appearance of fundamental soundness is visibly flawed – by Ahab's livid scar, and by the fissure in the masonry of Usher.[31]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27805,The Wind in the Willows,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows,"With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, ""Hang spring cleaning!"" He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with ""Ratty"" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had ""read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends"".[12]

InThe Enchanted Places,Christopher Robin Milnewrote ofThe Wind in the Willows:

The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story. Dramatisations include:

Abridged readings:

Other presentation formats:

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that ""Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...""[34]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421,Kidnapped,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_(novel),"The novel opens in the (fictional) village of Essendean in theEttrick Forestarea of theScottish Lowlandsin 1751. The main character and narrator is 17-year-old[a]David Balfour whose sole remaining parent, his father, has recently died. The minister of Essendean, Mr. Campbell, hands David a sealed letter left by his father with instructions that it be delivered to his father’s brother, Ebenezer, at his family's ancestral estate, the House of Shaws inCramond. Mr. Campbell tells David that he believes the letter may well prove to be advantageous to him.

After two day's walk cross country, David arrives at the ominous House of Shaws. There he is confronted by the paranoid Ebenezer with a loadedblunderbuss. His uncle is miserly, living on ""parritch"" andsmall ale, and the House of Shaws itself is partially unfinished and somewhat ruinous. David is allowed to stay and soon discovers evidence that his father may have been older than his uncle, thus making David the rightful heir to the estate. Ebenezer asks David to get a chest from the top of a tower in the house but refuses to provide a lamp or candle. David is forced to scale the stairs in the dark and realises that not only is the tower unfinished in some places, but the steps simply end abruptly and fall into an abyss. David concludes that his uncle intended for him to have an ""accident"", perhaps so as not to have to give over his nephew's inheritance.

David confronts his uncle, who promises to address the matter the next morning. A ship'scabin boy, Ransome, arrives the next morning and tells Ebenezer that Captain Hoseason of thebrigCovenantneeds to meet him to discuss business. Ebenezer takes David to a pier on theFirth of Forth, where Hoseason awaits, and David makes the mistake of leaving his uncle alone with the captain while he visits the shore with Ransome. Hoseason later offers to take them on board the brig for a drink and a brief tour, and David complies, only to see his uncle returning to shore alone in askiff. David is then immediately struck senseless.

David awakens, bound hand and foot, in the hold of the ship, and learns that per arrangement with David's uncle, the captain plans to sell him intoindentured servitudeinthe Carolinas. But the ship encounters contrary winds, which drive her back toward Scotland. Fog-bound near theHebrides, they strike a small boat. All of the small boat's crew are killed except one man,Alan Breck Stewart, who is brought on board and offers Hoseason a large sum of money to drop him off on the mainland. David later overhears the crew plotting to kill Alan instead. David and Alan barricade themselves in the roundhouse, where Alan kills the murderous helmsman and David wounds Hoseason. Alan then demonstrates his superior fighting skills as he easily kills five more men and intimidates the remaining crew into backing down.

Hoseason has no choice but to give Alan and David passage back to the mainland. David tells his tale to Alan, who in turn states that his birthplace, Appin, is under the tyrannical administration ofColin Roy of Glenure, the King'sfactorand a Campbell. Alan, who is a Jacobite agent and wears a French uniform, vows that should he find the ""Red Fox"" he will kill him.

TheCovenanttries to negotiate a difficult channel without a proper chart or pilot and is soon driven aground on the notoriousTorran Rocks. David and Alan are separated in the confusion, with David being washed ashore on the isle ofErraid, nearMull, while Alan and the surviving crew row to safety on that same island. David spends a few days alone in the wild before getting his bearings.

David learns that his new friend has survived, and David has two encounters with beggarly guides: one who attempts to stab him with a knife, and another who is blind but an excellent shot with a pistol. David soon reachesTorosay, where he is ferried across the river, receives further instructions from Alan's friend Neil Roy McRob, and later meets acatechistwho takes the lad to the mainland.

As he continues his journey, David encounters none other than the Red Fox, Colin Roy Campbell himself, who is accompanied by a lawyer, a servant, and a sheriff's officer. When David stops the Campbell man to ask him for directions, a hidden sniperkillsthe King's hated agent.

David is denounced as a conspirator and flees for his life, but by chance reunites with Alan. The youth believes Alan is the assassin, but Alan denies responsibility. Alan and David then begin their flight through theheather, hiding from government soldiers by day.  As the trek drains David's strength, his health rapidly deteriorates; by the time they are set upon by wild Highlanders who are sentries forCluny Macpherson, an outlawed chief in hiding, the lad is barely conscious. Alan convinces Cluny to give them shelter, and David is tended by a Highland doctor. He soon recovers, though in the meantime Alan loses all of their money at cards with Cluny, only for Cluny to give it back when David practically begs for it.

When David and Alan resume their flight in cold and rainy weather, David becomes ill again, and Alan carries him on his back down theburnto reach the nearest house, fortuitously that of aMaclaren, Duncan Dhu, who is both an ally of the Stewarts and a skilledpiper. David is bedridden and given a doctor's care, while Alan hides nearby, visiting after dark.

In one of the most humorous passages in the book, Alan convinces an innkeeper's daughter fromLimekilns(unnamed inKidnappedbut called ""Alison Hastie"" in its sequel) that David is a dying young Jacobite nobleman, despite David's objections, and she ferries them across the Firth of Forth. There, they meet a lawyer of David's uncle's, Mr. Rankeillor, who agrees to help David properly claim his inheritance. Rankeillor explains that David's father and uncle had once quarrelled over a woman, David's mother, and the older Balfour had married her, informally giving the estate to his brother to settle their dispute while living as an impoverished schoolteacher with his wife. This agreement had lapsed with his death.

David and the lawyer hide in bushes outside Ebenezer's house while Alan speaks to him, claiming to be a man who found David nearly dead after the wreck of theCovenantand says he is representing folk holding him captive in the Hebrides. He asks David's uncle whether Alan should kill David or keep him. The uncle flatly denies Alan's statement that David had been kidnapped but eventually admits that he paid Hoseason ""twenty pound"" to take David to ""Caroliny"". David and Rankeillor then emerge from their hiding places, and speak with Ebenezer in the kitchen, eventually agreeing that David will be provided two-thirds of the estate's income for as long as his uncle lives.

The novel ends with David and Alan parting ways onCorstorphine Hill; Alan returns to France, and David goes to a local bank to receive his money.

The characterJames Stewartwas real, and the man hanged for killing Colin Roy Campbell, though James was not the killer.[2]

Cluny MacPhersonandRob Roy MacGregorand his son, Robìn Òig or Young Rob, mentioned or met along the way, were real people.

Kidnappedis ahistorical romance, but by the time it was written, attitudes towards the genre had evolved from the earlier insistence on historical accuracy to one of faithfulness to the spirit of a bygone age. In the words of a critic writing inBentley's Miscellany, the historical novelist ""must follow rather the poetry of history than its chronology: his business is not to be the slave of dates; he ought to be faithful to the character of the epoch"".[3]Indeed, in the preface toKidnappedStevenson warns the reader that historical accuracy was not primarily his aim, remarking ""how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy"".[4]

Stevenson presents the Jacobite version of theAppin murderin the novel,[2]but sets the events in 1751, whereas the murder occurred in 1752.[5]

Kidnappedwas first published in the magazineYoung Folksfrom May to July 1886, and as a novel in the same year.

Robert Louis Stevenson(1850–1894) planned to write this story as early as 1880. He immersed himself in books on Scotland in the early and middle 18th century in preparation for writing. He was born and raised in Edinburgh, then travelled in England, France and the US. After his father died, he took his wife, children and his own mother as he traveled in search of a place more salutary to his health, finally building a house inSamoa, where he later died at age 44. He wroteKidnappedon his stay in England.

Stevenson remains one of the most popular and revered writers in the history of the English language, and was extremely prolific. His other works includeTreasure IslandandStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

A central theme of the novel is the concept of justice, the imperfections of the justice system and the lack of a universal definition of justice. To David justice means the restoration of his inheritance, whereas for Alan it means the death of his enemy Colin Roy of Glenure.

Literary critic Leslie Fiedler has suggested that a unifying ""mythic concept"" in several of Stevenson's books, includingKidnapped, is what might be called the ""Beloved Scoundrel"", or the ""Devil as Angel"", ""the beauty of evil"".[6]The Rogue in this instance is of course Alan, ""a rebel, a deserter, perhaps a murderer ... without a shred of Christian morality"".[7]Good nevertheless triumphs over evil, as in David Balfour's situation.

Kidnappedwas well received and sold well while Stevenson was alive. After his death many viewed it with scepticism, seeing it as simply a boys' novel. By the mid-20th century it had regained critical approval and study. The novel has attracted the praise and admiration of writers as diverse asHenry James,Jorge Luis Borges, andHilary Mantel.[1]

While it is basically an adventure novel, it raises various moral issues, such as the nature of justice and the fact that friends may have different political viewpoints.

A sequel,Catriona, was published in 1893.[8]

The novel has been adapted a number of times, and in multiple media.

Film and television versions were made in1917,1938,1948,1960, 1968,1971,1978,1986,1995and2005.

An adaptation for the stage byKeith Dewhurstwas produced by theRoyal Lyceum Theatre Company, Edinburgh in August 1972, withPaul Youngas David Balfour, James Grant asAlan Breck Stewart, and music bySteeleye Span.[9]

A four-part adaptation written byCatherine Czerkawskaand starringDavid Rintoulas David Balfour andPaul Youngas Alan Breck Stewart was broadcast onBBC Radio 4in 1985. A more recent two-part adaptation written byChris Dolanand starring Owen Whitelaw as David Balfour andMichael Nardoneas Alan Breck was broadcast also on BBC Radio 4 in 2016.[10]

Marvel Illustratedpublished acomic bookversion in 2007–2008, byRoy ThomasandMario Gully, who had previously adaptedTreasure Island.[11]

In 2023 theNational Theatre of Scotlandperformeda new stage adaptation, which featuredFrances Stevensonas narrator and reimagined the relationship between David Balfour and Alan Breck Stewart as a romance.[12][13]

It has been speculated that the novel was inspired in part by the true story from earlier in the 18th century ofJames Annesley, heir to five aristocratic titles who was kidnapped at the age of 12 by his uncleRichardand shipped fromDublinto America in 1728.[14]He managed to escape after 13 years and return to reclaim his birthright from his uncle in one of the longest courtroom dramas of its time.[15]Kidnappeddoes not end in the way Annesley's life story did, as the ship on which the main character was kidnapped never got beyond Scotland, allowing for a rich story of Scotland, highlands and lowlands. Further, a key event in the plot happens when David is present when Colin Roy Campbell falls dead from the unseen murderer's bullet.

Annesley biographer Ekirch felt in his response to a remark in the review of his book that ""It is inconceivable that Stevenson, a voracious reader of legal history, was unfamiliar with the saga of James Annesley, which by the time ofKidnapped'spublication in 1886 had already influenced four other 19th-century novels, most famouslySir Walter Scott'sGuy Mannering(1815) andCharles Reade'sThe Wandering Heir(1873).""[14][15]The Scottish authorAndro Linklater, who reviewed the book forThe Spectator, disagreed with this contention.[16]The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, did not mention the earlier historic event in the novel, nor in his correspondence; instead he namesThe Trial of James Stewartfor themurder of Colin Roy Campbell at Appinas an inspiration, according to his wife.[16]

As part of the events to celebrateEdinburghbecoming the firstUNESCOCity of Literature,[18]three versions ofKidnappedwere made freely available by being left in public places around the city.[19]Throughout February 2007, 25,000 copies of the novel were distributed in that way.[20]

A statue honouring Stevenson through a depiction of the two main characters fromKidnapped, Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour, was unveiled bySean Conneryin 2004 in Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh. The location for the work, which is by Scottish sculptorAlexander Stoddart, is where, in the novel, the two friends part ways.[21]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/155,The Moonstone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moonstone,"Colonel Herncastle, an unpleasant former soldier, brings the Moonstone back with him from India where he acquired it by theft and murder during theSiege of Seringapatam. Angry at his family, who shun him, he leaves it in his will as a birthday gift to his niece Rachel, thus exposing her to attack by the stone's hereditary guardians, who will stop at nothing to retrieve it.

Rachel wears the stone to her birthday party, but that night it disappears from her room. Suspicion falls on three Indian jugglers who have been near the house; on Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a localquicksand; and on Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious with Franklin Blake, with whom she has previously appeared to be enamoured, when he directs attempts to find it. Despite the efforts of Sergeant Cuff, a renownedScotland Yarddetective, the house party ends with the mystery unsolved, and the protagonists disperse.

During the ensuing year there are hints that the diamond was removed from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby, watching and waiting. Rachel's grief and isolation increase, especially after her mother dies, and she first accepts and then rejects a marriage proposal from her cousinGodfrey Ablewhite, a philanthropist who was also present at the birthday dinner and whose father owns the bank near Rachel's old family home. Finally Franklin Blake returns from travelling abroad and determines to solve the mystery. He first discovers that Rosanna Spearman's behaviour was due to her having fallen in love with him. She found evidence (a paint smear on his nightclothes) that convinced her that he was the thief and concealed it to save him, confusing the trail of evidence and throwing suspicion on herself. In despair at her inability to make him acknowledge her despite all she had done for him, she killed herself, leaving behind the smeared gown and a letter he did not receive at the time because of his hasty departure abroad.

Now believing that Rachel suspects him of the theft on Rosanna's evidence, Franklin engineers a meeting and asks her. To his astonishment she tells him she actually saw him steal the diamond and has been protecting his reputation at the cost of her own even though she believes him to be a thief and a hypocrite. With hope of redeeming himself he returns to Yorkshire to the scene of the crime and is befriended by Mr.Ezra Jennings, the assistant of Dr. Candy, the doctor. They join to continue the investigations and learn that Franklin was secretly givenlaudanumduring the night of the party (by Mr. Candy, who wanted to exact vengeance on Franklin for criticising medicine); it appears that this, in addition to his anxiety about Rachel and the diamond and other nervous irritations, caused him to take the diamond in a narcotic trance, to move it to a safe place. A re-enactment of the evening's events confirms this, but how the stone ended up in a London bank remains a mystery solved only a year after the birthday party when the stone is redeemed.

Franklin and his allies trace the claimant to a seedy waterside inn, only to discover that the Indians have got there first: the claimant is dead and the stone is gone. Under the dead man's disguise is none other than Godfrey Ablewhite, who is found to haveembezzledthe contents of atrust fundin his care and to have been facing exposure soon after the birthday party. The mystery of what Blake did while in his drugged state is solved: he encountered Ablewhite in the passageway outside Rachel's room and gave the Moonstone to him to be put back in his father's bank, from which it had been withdrawn on the morning of the party to be given to Rachel. Seeing his salvation, Ablewhite pocketed the stone instead, and pledged it assuretyfor a loan to save himself temporarily from insolvency. When he was murdered, he was on his way toAmsterdamto have the stone cut; it would then have been sold to replenish the plundered trust fund before the beneficiary inherited. The mystery is solved,Rachel and Franklin marry, and in an epilogue from Mr. Murthwaite, a noted adventurer, the reader learns of the restoration of the Moonstone to the place where it should be, in the forehead of thestatue of the godin India.

In researching the novel, Collins primarily drew on texts such asCharles William King'sThe Natural History of Precious Stones and Gems and of the Precious Metals(1865),Sir David Baird'sautobiography andJames Talboys Wheeler'sThe History of India(1867).[2]As well as this, he consulted various explorers to provide him first-hand information about Indian culture in order to increase the veracity of his book. At this early stage, the book's title wasThe Serpent's Eye.[3]

The final novel was serialised in the periodicalAll the Year Roundfrom 4 January to 8 August 1868, as well as simultaneously in the American publicationHarper's Magazine. This period was affected by several difficulties in Collins' life. His mother, Harriet Collins, died on 19 March 1868, and his presence at her bedside caused the novel to fall behind schedule. He also began to suffer a painful attack of gout, which he described in a preface to the 1871 edition as ""the bitterest affliction of my life and the severest illness from which I have ever suffered"".[4]To dull the pain, Collins took large amounts of laudanum, resulting in portions of the novel to be written in a drug-induced haze. He would later comment that he did not recall writing these passages.[3]Considering the substantial role the memory-altering effects of opium have in the plot of the novel, this seems significant.The Moonstonewas eventually published in book form by William Tinsley on 16 July 1868; it was dedicated to his mother.

A major theme of the novel is the intrusion of imperialism on everyday English life. Lynn Pykett argues that ""the main narrative ofThe Moonstoneconcerns the disruption of the tranquility and order of genteel English life by a colonial legacy.""[5]The events of the plot are set into motion by Colonel John Herncastle's unlawful theft of the Moonstone in India, and, in leaving the diamond to Rachel Verinder in his will, he is perpetuating his crime. It is only when the diamond is returned to its rightful owners that the 'curse' can be lifted. Pykett also comments that the contradictory forces of feminine passion and silence provide the conflict of the novel, ""[Sergeant] Cuff is defeated by the silence of women (Rachel and Rosanna), by feminine reticence (Lady Verinder), and the failure of individual women to conform to dominant stereotypes of femininity"".

The book is regarded by some as the forerunner of the modern mystery novel and thesuspensenovel.T. S. Eliotcalled it ""the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels in a genre invented by Collins and not byPoe,""[6]andDorothy L. Sayerspraised it as ""probably the very finest detective story ever written"".[7]G. K. Chestertoncalls it ""probably the best detective tale in the world"".[8]Graham Greeneargues thatThe Sign of Fouris derived ""a little too closely"" from it.[9]It was published in 1868, later than Poe's short story mysteries ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1841) (which introduced the famous locked-room paradigm), ""The Mystery of Marie Rogêt"" (1842) and ""The Purloined Letter"" (1845). The plot also shows some parallels withThe Hermitage(1839), an earlier murder mystery story by the English novelistSarah Burney: for example, the return of a childhood companion, the sexual symbolism of defloration implied in the crime, and the almost catatonic reactions of the heroine to it.[10]The Moonstoneintroduced a number of the elements that became classic attributes of the twentieth-century detective story in novel form, as opposed to Poe's short story form. These include:

Franklin Blake, the gifted amateur, is an early example of thegentleman detective. The highly competent Sergeant Cuff, the policeman called in fromScotland Yard(whom Collins based on the real-life InspectorJonathan Whicherwho solved the murder committed byConstance Kent),[11]is not a member of the gentry and is unable to break Rachel Verinder's reticence about what Cuff knows is an inside job.The Moonstonehas also been described as perhaps the earliestpolice procedural, due to the portrayal of Cuff.[12]The social difference between Collins's two detectives is shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff befriends Gabriel Betteredge, Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries her daughter Rachel.

A number of critics have suggested that Charles Felix (pseudonym forCharles Warren Adams), in hisNotting Hill Mystery(1862–1863), first used techniques that came to define the genre.[13][14]

The Moonstonerepresents Collins's only complete reprisal of the popular ""multi-narration"" method that he had previously used to great effect inThe Woman in White. The sections by Gabriel Betteredge (steward to the Verinder household) and Miss Clack (a poor relative and religious crank) offer both humour and pathos through their contrast with the testimony of other narrators, at the same time constructing and advancing the novel's plot.

The novel was Collins's last great success, coming at the end of an extraordinarily productive period in which four successive novels became bestsellers. AfterThe MoonstoneCollins wrote novels containing more overt social commentary that did not achieve the same audience.

A fictionalised account of Collins's life while writingThe Moonstoneforms much of the plot ofDan Simmons's novelDrood(2009).[15]

The Moonstonehad a great influence on other authors of the time, and books inspired by Collins' work quickly began appearing.Charles Dickens'The Mystery of Edwin Drood(1870) also features the theme of opium addiction, as well as several Anglo-Indian characters.Anthony Trollope'sThe Eustace Diamonds(1873) was written to tap into the thread of popular interest that Collins' novel caused, with the central plot revolving around the investigation of stolen jewels. A later book inspired by Wilkie Collins isPhilip Pullman'sThe Ruby in the Smoke(1985).[3]

The novel was made into several silent films during the first few decades of the twentieth century. A 1909 film version,The Moonstone, was produced byWilliam Nicholas Selig, although no copies have since survived. Another silent film,The Moonstone, was directed in 1915 byFrank Hall Crane.

In 1934, the book was made into a film,The MoonstonebyMonogram Pictures Corporation. Adapted to the screen byAdele S. Buffington, it was directed byReginald Barker, and starredDavid Manners, Charles Irwin andPhyllis Barry.[16]

On 11 March 1945, ""The Moonstone"" was episode number 67 of the U.S. radio seriesThe Weird Circle.[17]

In 1946,Classic Comics, the predecessor ofClassics Illustrated, published incomic bookformat the novel in issue #30, with cover and artwork byDon Rico.[18]The adaptation was re-published in 1960 with cover and artwork byL.B. Cole.[19]

On 15 April 1947, an adaptation of ""The Moonstone"" was episode #47 of theNBCradio seriesFavorite Storyhosted byRonald Colman.[20]On 16 November and 23 November 1953, ""The Moonstone"", starring Peter Lawford, was broadcast as a two-part episode of the U.S. radio drama ""Suspense"".[21]

In 1959, theBBCadapted the novel asa television serialstarringJames Hayter.

In 1972, a further BBC adaptationwas made, featuringRobin Ellis. This second version was aired in the United States onPBS'sMasterpiece Theatre.[22]

In 1972, an Italian TV version of the novel, entitled ""La pietra di luna"" was broadcast on the RAI, the Italian National Network. It was directed by Anton Giulio Majano, who had already directed adaptations from Dickens, Thackeray, and Stevenson.

In 1974, a German version,Der Monddiamant[de], was produced byWestdeutscher Rundfunkfor television.[23]

In November 1977,Marvel Comicsreleased a comic-book adaptation of the book in issue #23 of the ""Marvel Classics Comics"" series.

A radio adaptation aired in seven thirty minute episodes on BBC Radio 4 in 1979.

In 1996,The Moonstonewas made for television by the BBC andCarlton Televisionin partnership withWGBHof Boston, Massachusetts, airing again onMasterpiece Theatre. It starredGreg Wiseas Franklin Blake andKeeley Hawesas Rachel Verinder.

In 1998, a fifteen episode radio dramatization, with each episode lasting fifteen minutes, aired on the BBC World Service. This was written by Micheline Wandor.

In 2011,BBC Radio 4serialised the story in four hour-long episodes in theClassic Serialslot withEleanor Bronas Lady Verinder,Paul Rhysas Franklin Blake,Jasmine Hydeas Rachel Verinder andKenneth Cranhamas Sergeant Cuff.

In 2016, theBBCadapted the novel for a five-part afternoon TV seriesThe Moonstonestarting 31 October 2016.

In December 2018, Screen14 Pictures, a team that produces fictional stories' adaption for the web, created a serialisedweb seriesof the novel onYouTube,Twitter, andInstagram.[24]

In April 2020, the novel was read in serialized fashion byPhoebe JudgeofCriminalon herPhoebe Reads a Mysterypodcast."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20000,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas,"In 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterioussea monster, which is speculated to be a giganticnarwhal. The U.S. government assembles an expedition inNew York Cityto find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a Frenchmarine biologistand the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition.Canadianwhalerand masterharpoonerNed Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.

The expedition leaves Brooklyn aboard theUnited States NavyfrigateAbraham Lincoln, then travels south aroundCape Horninto thePacific Ocean. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. Aronnax and Land are hurled into the sea, and Conseil jumps into the water after them. They survive by climbing onto the ""monster"", which, they are startled to find, is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they are captured and introduced to the submarine's mysterious constructor and commander,Captain Nemo.

The rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard theNautilus, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation — a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to escape terrestrialcivilization. Nemo explains that his submarine iselectrically poweredand can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he cannot let them leave — they must remain on board permanently.

They visit many oceanic regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers viewcoralformations, sunken vessels from theBattle of Vigo Bay, theAntarcticice barrier, thetransatlantic telegraph cable, and the legendary underwater realm ofAtlantis. They even travel to the South Pole and are trapped in an upheaval of an iceberg on the way back, caught in a narrow gallery of ice from which they are forced to dig themselves out. The passengers also put ondiving suits, huntsharksand other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by theNautilus. When the submarine returns to theAtlantic Ocean, a school ofgiant squid(""devilfish"") attacks the vessel and kills another crewman.

The novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, theNautilusis attacked by awarshipfrom the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo — whom Aronnax dubs an ""archangel of hatred"" — rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression.

Circumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, he announces that they are in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him, yet he is still drawn to the man. Fearing that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, he avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, ""O almighty God! Enough! Enough!"". Aronnax immediately joins his companions as they carry out their escape plans, but as they board the submarine's skiff they realize that theNautilushas seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, theMoskenstraumen(more commonly known as the ""Maelstrom""). They escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate remained unknown until the events ofThe Mysterious Island.

Captain Nemo's assumed name recallsHomer'sOdyssey, whenOdysseusencounters the monstrousCyclopsPolyphemusin the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it isOutis(Οὖτις) 'no one', translated intoLatinas ""Nemo"". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for ten years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.

The novel repeatedly mentions the U.S. Naval CommanderMatthew Fontaine Maury, an oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.

The novel alludes to other Frenchmen, includingLapérouse, the celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation;Dumont d'Urville, a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lapérouse's ships; andFerdinand de Lesseps, builder of theSuez Canaland nephew of the sole survivor of Lapérouse's ill-fated expedition. TheNautilusfollows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lapérouse's vessels disappeared; she entersTorres Straitand becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, theAstrolabe; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

In possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-described battle with a school ofgiant squid, one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: ""To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author ofThe Toilers of the Sea."" A bestselling novel in Verne's day,The Toilers of the Seaalso features a threateningcephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by critics to be symbolic of theIndustrial Revolution. Certainly, Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in theRevolutions of 1848.

Other symbols and themes pique modern critics.Margaret Drabble, for instance, argues that Verne's masterwork also anticipated theecology movementand influenced Frenchavant-gardeimagery.[8]As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during theCretan Revolt of 1866–1869, proving to Professor Aronnax that he had not severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues anIndianpearl diverfrom a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. When asked why he would help a ""representative of that race from which he'd fled under the seas"", Nemo responds that the diver, as an ""East Indian"", ""lives in the land of the oppressed"".[9]

Indeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the book's final form, Nemo says to professor Aronnax, ""That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!""[10]In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was aPolish nobleman, whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the PolishJanuary Uprisingof 1863. These specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisherPierre-Jules Hetzel, believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of theRussian Empire, hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy war, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins.

Even so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under a Polish hero,Tadeusz Kościuszko, leader of theuprising against Russian and Prussian control in 1794;[11]Kościuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation ""Finis Poloniae!"" (""Polandis no more!"").

Five years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel,The Mysterious Island. The novel changes the captain's nationality from Polish to Indian; in the book's final chapters, Nemo reveals that he is an Indian prince named Dakkar who was a descendant ofTipu Sultan, a prominent ruler of theKingdom of Mysore, and participated in theIndian Rebellion of 1857, an ultimately unsuccessful uprising againstCompany rule in India. After the rebellion, which led to the death of his family, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages.

Verne took the name ""Nautilus"" from one of theearliest successful submarines, built in 1800 byRobert Fulton, who also invented the first commercially successfulsteamboat. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chamberednautilus. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developedFrench NavysubmarinePlongeurat the 1867Exposition Universelle, which guided him in his development of the novel'sNautilus.[4]

The diving gear used by passengers on theNautilusis presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) thesurface-supplied[12]hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatusdesigned by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865. Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demandregulator.[12][13][14]The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called anaérophore(Greek for ""air-carrier""). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, but Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: ""TheNautilus's pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.""

The novel was first translated into English in 1872 by ReverendLewis Page Mercier. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the Frenchscaphandre— properly ""diving suit"" — as ""cork-jacket"", following a long-obsolete usage as ""a type oflifejacket""). Some of these distortions may have been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally includingDaniel O'Connell[15]among other international figures. Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later retranslations continued to recycle its mistakes, including mistranslating the title as ""...under the Sea"", rather than ""...under the Seas"".

In 1962, Anthony Bonner published a translation of the novel withBantam Classics. This edition included an introduction byRay Bradbury, comparing Captain Nemo toCaptain AhabofMoby-Dick.[16]

A significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.[17]Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text. In 1976, Miller published ""The Annotated Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea""[18]at the suggestion of theThomas Y. Crowel Companyeditorial staff.[19]The cover declared it ""The only completely restored and annotated edition"". In 1993, Miller collaborated with his fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter to produce ""The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition"", published in 1993 by theNaval Institute Press.[20]Its text took advantage of Walter's unpublished translation, whichProject Gutenberglater made available online.

In 1998, William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, published byOxford University Press(ISBN978-0-19-953927-7). Butcher includes detailed notes, a comprehensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by Hetzel, his publisher.

In 2010, Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation,20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations titledAmazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classicsand published byState University of New York Press(ISBN978-1-4384-3238-0).

In 2017, David Coward issued a new translation published byPenguin Classics(ISBN9780141394930) with the titleTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, including a new introduction, notes, and a note on the text, using the 1871 Christian Chelebourg edition of the text as the basis for his translation. Coward also included 42 illustrations, which were published for the first time in the 'Collection Hetzel' in 1901.

The science fiction writerTheodore L. Thomascriticized the novel in 1961, claiming that ""there is not a single bit of valid speculation"" in the book and that ""none of its predictions has come true"". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and theNautilusas ""pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time."" The notes to the 1993 translation point out that the errors Thomas notes were in Mercier's translation, not the original.

Despite his criticisms, Thomas conceded: ""Put them all together with the magic of Verne's story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it"".[13]

In 2023, Malaurie Guillaume presented Nemo as the firsteco-terroristor first figure of ecologic radicality.[21]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3618,Arms and the Man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_and_the_Man,"The play takes place during the 1885Serbo-Bulgarian War. Its heroine, Raina Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, a battlefield hero whom she idolizes. On the night after theBattle of Slivnitza, Captain Bluntschli, aSwiss mercenaryin the defeated Serbian army, climbs in through her bedroom balcony and threatens her not to give the alarm. When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search for him, Raina hides him. He tells her that ""nine soldiers out of ten are born fools"". Bluntschli's businesslike attitude to war shocks the idealistic Raina, especially after he admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than pistol cartridges. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother Catherine sneak him out of the house, disguised in one of Raina's father's old coats.

The war ends and Raina's father, Major Paul Petkoff, returns home with Sergius. Raina begins to find Sergius bombastic and tiresome, but she hides it. Sergius also finds Raina's romantic ideals tiresome, and flirts with Raina's insolent servant girl Louka (asoubretterole), who is engaged to the Petkoffs' manservant Nicola. Bluntschli unexpectedly returns to give back the old coat, but also to see Raina. Raina and her mother are shocked when Major Petkoff and Sergius reveal that they have met Bluntschli before and invite him to lunch (and to help them figure out how to send the troops home).

Left alone with Bluntschli, Raina realizes that though he sees through her romanticism, he respects her, as Sergius does not. She reveals that she left a photograph of herself in a pocket of the coat, inscribed ""To my chocolate-cream soldier"", but Bluntschli says he did not find it, and it must still be in the coat. Bluntschli gets a telegram informing him of his father's death: he must now take over the family's luxury hotels in Switzerland.

Louka gossips to Sergius that Raina had protected Bluntschli and is in love with him. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel, but Bluntschli evades it. Sergius and Raina break off their engagement, with some relief on both sides. Major Petkoff discovers the photograph in the pocket of his old coat; Raina and Bluntschli try to dispose of it, but Petkoff is determined to learn the truth and claims that the ""chocolate-cream soldier"" is Sergius. After Bluntschli confesses the whole story to Major Petkoff, Sergius proposes marriage to Louka (to Major Petkoff and Catherine's horror); the manservant Nicola quietly and gallantly lets Sergius have her; and Bluntschli, recognising Nicola's merits, offers him a job as hotel manager.

While Raina is now unattached, Bluntschli protests that—being 34 and believing she is 17—he is too old for her. On learning that she is actually 23, he immediately proposes and shows her the telegram announcing his inheritance. Raina, realizing the hollowness of her romantic ideals, protests that she would prefer him as a poor ""chocolate-cream soldier"" than as a wealthy businessman. Bluntschli protests that he is still the same person, and she proclaims her love for him. The play ends as Bluntschli, with Swiss precision, arranges the major's troop movements and informs them he will return to marry Raina in exactly two weeks.

George Orwellsaid thatArms and the Manwas written when Shaw was at the height of his powers as a dramatist. ""It is probably the wittiest play he ever wrote, the most flawless technically, and in spite of being a very light comedy, the most telling.""[8]His other plays of the period, equally well written, were about issues that, according to Orwell, were no longer controversial at the time Orwell was writing. For example, the theme ofMrs. Warren's Profession, which so shocked audiences at the time, was that the causes of prostitution are mainly economic, which was already a common opinion in Orwell's time, and the playWidowers' Houseswas an attack on slum landlords, who had since become stock villains.[9]

In 2024, an attempt to stageJohn Malkovich's production of the play atIvan Vazov National Theatreof Bulgaria was targeted bynationalistprotesters that considered it a calumny of Bulgaria. The mob surrounded the theatre, threwsmoke bombs, prevented the visitors that had bought tickets from entering the theatre hall, accusing them of being traitors and threatening them, and physically assaulted the director of the play and the director of the theatre.[10][11]

The chocolate-cream soldier of the play has inspired a pejorative military use of the term.[citation needed]Israelisoldiers use the term ""chocolate soldier"" (hayal shel shokolad, חייל של שוקולד) to disparage a soldier not tough enough to fight.[24]The AustralianCitizens Military Forcewere derided by the regular army as ""chokos"" or chocolate soldiers, implying they were not real soldiers.[25][26]"

Lieutenant Frederic Henry is an Americanmedicserving in theItalian Army, who speaksItalian. The novel begins during the First World War. It is the start of winter, when acholeraepidemic kills thousands of soldiers. Frederic visitsGorizia, where he meets other army fellows and the priest. He finds there are twobrothels–  one for officers and the other for lower-rank soldiers. On his return, he shares his experience with his friend, Surgeon Rinaldi, who is about the same age as Frederic.

Rinaldi is fond of beautiful women. He has fallen in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley, though not so seriously. Rinaldi takes Frederic to a British hospital, where Frederic is introduced to, and attracted to, Catherine. She tells him about her fiancé, who was killed in battle, and also about feeling uncomfortable in the rain, as it starts to rain. Frederic tries to kiss her, but she refuses and slaps him.  She regrets doing so and eventually warms to him and they kiss.

Frederic and his fellow drivers (Passini, Manera, Gordini and Gavuzzi) take the ambulance into war. Passini is killed in amortarattack. Frederic is severely wounded in the knee on theItalian frontand is sent to the hospital.

Surgeon Rinaldi visits Frederic in the hospital and praises him for his heroism, but Frederic denies any display of such. Rinaldi also tells him that he will be shifted to a hospital in Milan soon for a better treatment. Frederic requests him to have Catherine there as a nurse. The priest pays a visit. In a discussion again, Frederic expresses his views against war. Meanwhile, America has declared war on Germany, and the Italian army is also anxious about war against Austria. Frederic reaches an American hospital in Milan. There he is nursed by Miss Gage, Mrs. Walker and their Superintendent Miss Van Campen. Miss Gage arranges wine for him. Catherine arrives there, and Frederic realizes a strong sense of love and passion for her. They make love for the first time. Doctor Valentini comes to examine his injury and X-rays. This book portrays the growth of Frederic's relationship with Catherine over the summer. They enjoy boating and horse races. Meanwhile, Frederic meets Helen Ferguson, a fellow nurse of Catherine. After his knee heals, Frederic is diagnosed withjaundice. A three-weeks convalescent leave is sanctioned for him. Miss Van Campen discovers empty liquor bottles in Frederic's room and takes alcoholism as the cause for his condition. She also concludes that Frederic is knowingly keeping himself ill to avoid the war front. She files a report for the cancellation of convalescent leave, and Frederic is called back to the war front. Catherine informs him that she is three-months pregnant. They promise to reunite and marry after his return from war. Frederic asks her to take care of ""Little Catherine"".

Frederic returns to Gorizia. Rinaldi comes and examines his wounded leg. He further asks whether they have married or not. The priest notices a change in Frederic and also predicts that the war will end soon. Frederic travels toBainsizza, where he meets Gino, who tells him about an artillery battery of terrifying guns that the Austrians have. Frederic realizes that Italians will not escape if the Austrians attack. It rains heavily, and the bombarding begins. Frederic discovers that morale has severely dropped. Not long afterwards, theAustro-Hungariansbreak through the Italian lines in theBattle of Caporetto, and the Italians retreat. The houses are evacuated. Women and children are loaded in trucks. At the villa, Frederic discovers that Rinaldi has taken off for the hospital; everyone else has evacuated too. There is considerable delay and chaos on the road during the retreat, and Frederic, wishing to avoid a possible aerial attack while stuck on the main retreat route, decides to take an alternate path. He and his men quickly get lost, and their cars are stuck in the mud, Frederic orders the two engineering sergeants riding with Bonello to help. Afraid of being overtaken by the enemy, they refuse and try to leave. Frederic draws his gun and shoots one of them; the other escapes. One of the drivers, Aymo, is later killed, while another, Bonello, runs away to surrender to the Austrians. Frederic and his last companion, Piani, catch up to the main retreat across the Tagliamento river. As soon as they cross the bridge, Frederic is taken by the military police to a place on the river bank where officers are being interrogated and executed for the ""treachery"" that supposedly led to the Italian defeat. Frederic escapes by jumping into the river. Afterwards, he walks through the plains and jumps aboard a moving train to Milan to find Catherine.

Reaching Milan, he learns that Catherine has left forStresa. He goes to visit Ralph Simmons, one of the opera singers that he encountered earlier, and asks about the procedures for traveling to Switzerland. Ralph helps him, giving him civilian clothes. Frederic feels very odd in those clothes, as the people look at him scornfully. He reachesStresaby train and goes to theGrand Hotel des Iles Borromées. Emilio, a bartender, informs him that two English nurses are staying at a small hotel near the train station. Frederic meets Catherine and Helen Ferguson there. He also meets Count Greffi, a very old nobleman whom Frederic had met on his last visit to Stresa. Greffi is staying with his niece. Frederic avoids Catherine's question about the war experiences. He feels that he is a criminal, a war deserter. Emilio informs him that Italian police are looking to arrest him. Catherine and Frederic plan to flee toSwitzerlandas Emilio makes all possible arrangements for their travel in arowboat. Because of a storm, the waters are choppy and rough. Frederic rows the boat all night, and Catherine also takes a turn rowing. Finally, they reach Switzerland. The guards verify their identity and provide them provisional visas for staying in Switzerland.

Frederic and Catherine live a quiet life in the mountains. They move to a wooden house on a mountain outside the village ofMontreux. They develop new acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen. At times, Catherine starts getting concerned about their child, especially about its health. They move to the town ofLausanneto be closer to the hospital. Later, Catherine goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. The doctor tells Frederic that the best solution would be acaesarean operation. She suffers a lot of pain and finally delivers astillbornbaby boy. Later the nurse tells him that Catherine is hemorrhaging. He is terrified. He goes to see her, and she dies with him by her side. He leaves the hospital and walks back to his hotel in the rain.

The novel was partly based on Hemingway's own experiences serving in theItalian campaignsduring the First World War. The inspiration for Catherine Barkley wasAgnes von Kurowsky, a nurse who cared for Hemingway in a hospital in Milan after he had been wounded. He had planned to marry her, but she spurned his love when he returned to America.[6]Kitty Cannell, a Paris-based fashion correspondent, became Helen Ferguson. The unnamed priest was based on Don Giuseppe Bianchi, the priest of the 69th and 70th regiments of the Brigata Ancona. Although the sources for Rinaldi are unknown, the character had already appeared inIn Our Time.

Much of the plot was written in correspondence with Frederic J. Agate. Agate, Hemingway's friend, had a collection of letters to his wife from his time in Italy, which were later used as inspiration.[7]

Michael Reynolds, however, writes that Hemingway was not involved in the battles described. Because his previous novel,The Sun Also Rises, had been written as aroman à clef, readers assumedA Farewell to Armsto be autobiographical.[4]A Farewell to Armswas begun during his time at Willis M. Spear's guest ranch in Wyoming's Bighorns.[8]Some pieces of the novel were written inPiggott, Arkansas, atthe homeof his then-wife Pauline Pfeiffer,[9]and inMission Hills, Kansas, while she was awaiting delivery of their baby.[10]Pauline underwent acaesarean sectionas Hemingway was writing the scene about Catherine Barkley's childbirth.[11]

Hemingway struggled with the ending. By his count, he wrote 39 versions of it ""before [he] was satisfied"".[12]However, a 2012 edition of the book included no fewer than 47 alternate endings.[12]

The novel was first serialized inScribner's Magazinein the May 1929 to October 1929 issues. The book was published in September 1929 with afirst editionprint-run of approximately 31,000 copies.[13]The success ofA Farewell to Armsmade Hemingway financially independent.[14]

The Hemingway Library Editionwas released in July 2012, with a dust jacket facsimile of the first edition. The newly published edition presents an appendix with the many alternate endings Hemingway wrote for the novel in addition to pieces from early draft manuscripts.[15]

TheJohn F. Kennedy Presidential Library and MuseumHemingway collection has two handwritten pages with possible titles for the book. Most of the titles come fromThe Oxford Book of English Verse.[16]One of the possible titles Hemingway considered wasIn Another Country and Besides. This comes fromThe Jew of MaltabyChristopher Marlowe. The poemPortrait of a LadybyT. S. Eliotalso starts off by quoting this Marlowe work: ""Thou hast committed / Fornication: but that was in another country, / And besides, the wench is dead."" Hemingway's library included both works by Eliot and Marlowe.[17]

There are at least two copies of the first edition into which Hemingway had re-inserted the censored text[clarification needed]by hand to provide a corrected text. One of these copies was presented toMaurice Coindreau, the other toJames Joyce.[18]Hemingway's corrected text was finally inserted into one edition of the novel,[19]and there are some audiobook versions that are uncensored.[citation needed]

A Farewell to Armswasbannedin theIrish Free State.[20]

Also, the novel could not be published in Italy until 1948 because theFascist regimeconsidered it detrimental to the honor of theArmed Forces, both in its description of theBattle of Caporettoand because of a certainanti-militarismimplied in the work. More than one biographer has suggested that, at the base of the censorship of the Fascist regime in the novel, there had also been a personal antipathy between the writer andBenito Mussolini. Hemingway had interviewed him in 1923, shortly after he had seized power, and in Hemingway's article in theToronto Starhe poured scorn on Mussolini, calling him ""the biggest bluff in Europe"". But, apart from the official reactions, it is known that Mussolini did not like the article at all: Hemingway described Mussolini as trying to impress the media by pretending to be deeply absorbed in reading, while in reality he was holding a French–English dictionary upside down.[21]The Italian translation had in fact already been prepared illegally in 1943 byFernanda Pivano, leading to her arrest inTurin.

A Farewell to Armswas met with favorable criticism and is considered one of Hemingway's best literary works.[22]

Gore Vidalwrote of the text: ""... a work of ambition, in which can be seen the beginning of the careful, artful, immaculate idiocy of tone that since has marked ... [Hemingway's] prose"".[23]The last line of the 1929New York Timesreview reads: ""It is a moving and beautiful book.""[24]

Bakerremarks on the theme ofA Farewell to Arms: ""After ten years of meditation and digestive of his experience, Hemingway lays before his readers a work which is far from a mere war experience, nor a story of love and death during the war.""

However, since publication,A Farewell to Armshas also been the target of various controversy. Upon its flimsy publication—due to the medium of its release—throughScribner's Magazine, it was banned from Boston newsstands due to accusations of a pornographic nature, despite Hemingway's deliberate exclusion of graphic descriptions of sex, using omission as a literary device.[25]

The novel was first adapted for the stage byLaurence Stallingsin 1930,[26]then as afilm in 1932, with a1957 remake. Athree-part television miniserieswas made in 1966. In December 2023, a new film adaptation was announced, withMichael Winterbottomto direct andTom Blythto star.[27]

The 1996 filmIn Love and War, directed byRichard Attenboroughand starringChris O'DonnellandSandra Bullock, depicts Hemingway's life in Italy as an ambulance driver in the events prior to his writing ofA Farewell to Arms.[citation needed]

A radio broadcast adaption wasproduced in 1937as part of the Lux Radio Theater series, starringClark GableandJosephine Hutchinson. In 2011, BBC Radio 4 produced a 10-episode[28]adaptation for their15 Minute Dramaseries.

On the morning of 2 October 1872, having dismissed his valet for bringing him shaving water at a temperature slightly lower than expected, Fogg hires FrenchmanJean Passepartoutas a replacement.

That evening, while at the Club, Fogg gets involved in a discussion regarding an article inThe Morning Chronicle(orThe Daily Telegraphin some editions) stating that with the opening of a newrailway section in India, it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for £20,000, half of his fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45 p.m.; to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later. They take Fogg's remaining £20,000 with them to cover expenses during the journey.

Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez on time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by aScotland Yardpoliceman, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of James Strand, a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of Strand, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (theMongolia) conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They arrive in Bombay on 20 October, two days ahead of schedule, and board a train heading towardsCalcuttathat evening.

The early arrival in Bombay proves beneficial for Fogg and Passepartout, as contrary to what the newspaper article had said, an 80 km (50 mi) stretch of track from Kholby toAllahabadhas not yet been built. Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide and starts toward Allahabad.

They come across a procession in which a young Indian woman,Aouda, is about to beburned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Since she is drugged withopiumandhashishand is not going voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of her deceased husband on the funeral pyre. He rises from the pyre during the ceremony, scaring off the priests and carries Aouda away. The two days gained earlier are lost but Fogg shows no regret.

Fogg and Passepartout re-board the train at Allahabad, taking Aouda with them. When the travelers arrive in Calcutta, Fix, who had arrived ahead of them, has Fogg and Passepartout arrested for a crime Passepartout had committed in Bombay. They jump bail and board a steamer (theRangoon) going toHong Kong, with a day's stopover inSingapore. Fix also boards theRangoon; he shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his friend from the earlier voyage.

In Hong Kong, the group learns Aouda's distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved toHolland, so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, theCarnatic, Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama but cannot inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.

Fogg discovers he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him toYokohama, finding a pilot boat, theTankadere, that takes him, Aouda, and Fix toShanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. There, they search for Passepartout, believing he arrived on theCarnaticas initially planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, theGeneral Grant, taking them across thePacifictoSan Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey but instead support him in getting back to Britain, where he can arrest him.

In San Francisco, they board atranscontinentaltrain toNew York City, encountering several obstacles along the way: a herd ofbisoncrossing the tracks, a failingsuspension bridgeand a band ofSiouxwarriors ambushing the train. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the warriors. Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by awind-poweredsledtoOmahaand then get a train to New York.

In New York, having missed the shipChina, Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat,Henrietta, destined forBordeaux, France. The captain of the boat refuses to take them to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 per passenger. He then bribes the crew tomutinyand makes course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. When the coal runs out, Fogg buys the boat from the captain, then has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.

The companions arrive atQueenstown (Cobh), Ireland, take the train toDublinand then a ferry toLiverpool, still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up – the actual robber had been caught three days earlier inEdinburgh. As a result of the delay, Fogg misses the scheduled train to London; he orders a special train and arrives in London apparently five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.

The following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, their days were shortened by four minutes for every degree of longitude they crossed; thus, although they had experienced the same amount of time abroad as people had experienced in London, they had seen 80 sunrises and sunsets while London had seen only 79. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake and Fogg hurries to the Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having spent almost £19,000 of his travel money during the journey, he divides the remainder between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.

Around the World in Eighty Dayswas written during difficult times, both for France and Verne. It was during theFranco-Prussian War(1870–1871) in which Verne wasconscriptedas a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paidroyalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed apublic execution, which disturbed him.[6]

The technological innovations of the 19th century had opened the possibility of rapid circumnavigation, and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–1870 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: the completion of thefirst transcontinental railroadin America (1869), the opening of theSuez Canal(1869), and thelinking of the Indian railwaysacross the sub-continent (1870). It was another notable mark at the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.[6]

The story began serialization inLe Tempson 6 November 1872.[7]The story was published in installments over the next 45 days, with its ending timed to synchronize Fogg's December 21 deadline with the real world. Chapter XXXV appeared on 20 December;[8]21 December, the date upon which Fogg was due to appear back in London, did not include an installment of the story;[9]on 22 December, the final two chapters announced Fogg's success.[10]As it was being published serially for the first time, some readers believed that the journey was actually taking place – bets were placed, and some railway companies and ship liner companies lobbied Verne to appear in the book. It is unknown if Verne submitted to their requests, but the descriptions of some rail and shipping lines leave some suspicion he was influenced.[6]

Concerning the finalcoup de théâtre, Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was because he had forgotten that during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rate of an hour per 15° oflongitudecrossed. At the time of publication and until 1884, ade jureInternational Date Linedid not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, Fogg's mistake would not have been likely to occur in the real world because ade factodate line did exist. The UK, India, and the US had the same calendar with different local times. When he arrived in San Francisco, he would have noticed that the local date was one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. Consequently, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the Chinasteamerin New York were one day earlier than his travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, inWho Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?,John Sutherlandpoints out that Fogg and company would have to be ""deaf, dumb and blind"" not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent ""Sunday"", with theSunday Observance Act 1780still in effect.[11]

Following publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg's fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints:

The idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the titleAround the World in Eighty Daysis not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.[6]

Another early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni FrancescoGemelli Careri. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World orVoyage du Tour du Monde(1719, Paris).[19]

Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway, was published in 1871 by theUnion Pacific Railroad Company, and anAround the World in A Hundred and Twenty Daysby Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of 38,204 km (23,739 mi) in 77 days and 21 hours.[20]

AmericanWilliam Perry Foggtraveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters toThe Cleveland Leadernewspaper, entitled,Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt(1872).[21][22]

In 1872,Thomas Cookorganised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters published in 1873 asLetter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World.Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne's account and Cook's letters. However, some argue that Cook's trip happened too late to influence Verne. According to a second-hand 1898 account, Verne refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book. In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was ""through reading one day in a Paris cafe"" and ""due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.""Around the Worlditself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook's advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.[6]

The periodicalLe Tour du monde(3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled ""Around the World in Eighty Days"", which refers to 230 km (140 mi) of the railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne's work. But even theLe Tour de mondearticle was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography theNouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Archéologie(August 1869), which also contains the titleAround the World in Eighty Daysin its contents page. TheNouvelles Annaleswere written byConrad Malte-Brun(1775–1826) and his sonVictor Adolphe Malte-Brun(1816–1889). Scholars[who?]believe that Verne was aware of theLe Tour de mondearticle, theNouvelles Annales,or both and that he consulted it or them, noting that theLe Tour du mondeeven included a trip schedule very similar to Verne's final version.[6]

A possible inspiration was the travellerGeorge Francis Train, who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, ""Verne stole my thunder. I'm Phileas Fogg.""[6]

Regarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: ""I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in theSièclethat a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was adénouementready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form."" In his April 1873 lecture, ""The Meridians and the Calendar"", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day occurred since theInternational Date Lineonly became current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article inNature,andEdgar Allan Poe's short story ""Three Sundays in a Week"" (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in hisEdgar Poe and His Works(1864).[6]

The book has been adapted or reimagined many times in different forms."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583,The Woman in White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_White_(novel),"Walter Hartright, a young art teacher, encounters and gives directions to a mysterious and distressed woman dressed entirely in white, lost in London; he later learns she has escaped from an asylum. Soon afterwards, he travels to Limmeridge House inCumberland, having been hired as a drawing teacher on the recommendation of his friend, Pesca, an Italian language teacher. The Limmeridge household comprises the invalid Frederick Fairlie and Walter's students: Laura Fairlie, Mr. Fairlie's niece, and Marian Halcombe, her devoted half-sister. Walter realises that Laura bears an astonishing resemblance to the woman in white, who is known to the household by the name of Anne Catherick, a mentally disabled child who formerly lived near Limmeridge and was devoted to Laura's mother, who first dressed her in white.

Over the next few months, Walter and Laura fall in love, despite Laura's betrothal to Sir Percival Glyde,Baronet. Upon realising this, Marian advises Walter to leave Limmeridge. Laura receives an anonymous letter warning her against marrying Glyde. Walter deduces that Anne has sent the letter and encounters her again in Cumberland; he becomes convinced that Glyde originally placed Anne in the asylum. Despite the misgivings of the family lawyer over the financial terms of the marriage settlement, which will give the entirety of Laura's fortune to Glyde if she dies without leaving an heir, and Laura's confession that she loves another man, Laura and Glyde marry in December 1849 and travel to Italy for six months. Concurrently, Walter joins an expedition toHonduras.

After six months, Sir Percival and Lady Glyde return to his house,BlackwaterPark inHampshire; accompanied by Glyde's friend, Count Fosco (married to Laura's aunt). Marian, at Laura's request, lives at Blackwater and learns that Glyde is in financial difficulties. Glyde attempts to bully Laura into signing a document that would allow him to use her marriage settlement of £20,000, which Laura refuses to do. Anne, who is now terminally ill, travels to Blackwater Park and contacts Laura, saying that she holds a secret that will ruin Glyde's life. Before she can disclose the secret, Glyde discovers their communication, and believing Laura knows his secret, becomes extremely paranoid and attempts to keep her held at Blackwater. With the problem of Laura's refusal to give away her fortune and Anne's knowledge of his secret, Fosco conspires to use the resemblance between Laura and Anne to exchange their two identities. Sir Percival and Fosco will trick both individuals into travelling with them to London; Laura will be placed in an asylum under the identity of Anne, and Anne will be buried under the identity of Laura upon her imminent death. Marian overhears enough of the plan to understand they are conspiring against someone's life but not any of the details, but becomes soaked by rain in her hiding place and falls ill.

While Marian is ill, Laura is tricked into travelling to London, and the identity switch is accomplished. Anne Catherick succumbs to her illness and is buried as Laura, while Laura is drugged and conveyed to the asylum as Anne. When Marian visits the asylum, hoping to learn something from Anne, she finds Laura, who has been treated by her attendants as a deluded Anne when she protests her true identity as Laura. Marian bribes the nurse, and Laura escapes. Meanwhile, Walter has returned from Honduras, and the three live incognito in London, making plans to restore Laura's identity. During his research, Walter discovers Glyde's secret: he was illegitimate, and therefore not entitled to inherit his title or property. In the belief that Walter has discovered or will discover his secret, Glyde attempts to incinerate the incriminating documents but perishes in the flames. From Anne's mother (Jane Catherick), Walter discovers that Anne never knew what Glyde's secret was. She had only known that there was a secret around Glyde and had repeated words her mother had said in anger to threaten Glyde. The truth was that Glyde's mother was already married to an Irish man, who had left her, and was not free to remarry. While he had no problem claiming the estate, Glyde needed his parents' marriage certificate to borrow money. He therefore went to a church in the village where his parents had lived together and where the vicar, who had served there, had died long ago, and added a fake marriage to the church register.  Mrs. Catherick helped him obtain access to the register and was rewarded with a gold watch and an annual payment.

During the period of Glyde and Mrs. Catherick's relationship, a vestry-clerk from a nearby town made regular visits to the church and made copies of the church's marriage register. These duplicates were kept safely in the vestry-clerk's office in town. Walter, knowing of the suspect entry in the church register, goes to the vestry-clerk's office, obtains the duplicate, and finds that no such entry exists in it, thus confirming the original register contained a fake entry.

With the death of Glyde in a fire while attempting to destroy the original register in the church, with the faked entry, the trio is safe from persecution, but they still have no way of proving Laura's true identity. Walter suspects that Anne died before Laura's trip to London, and proof of this would prove their story, but only Fosco knows the dates. Walter works out from a letter he received from Mrs. Catherick's former employer that Anne was the illegitimate child of Laura's father, making her Laura's half-sister. On a visit to the opera with Pesca, he learns that Fosco has betrayed an Italian nationalist society, of which Pesca is a high-ranking member. When Fosco prepares to flee the country, Walter forces a written confession from him in exchange for safe passage from England. Laura's identity is legally restored, and the inscription on her gravestone replaced by that of Anne Catherick. Fosco escapes, only to be killed by another agent of the society. To ensure the legitimacy of his efforts on her part, Walter and Laura have married earlier; upon the death of Frederick Fairlie, their son inherits Limmeridge.

A theme of the story is the unequal position of married women in law at the time. Laura Glyde's interests have been neglected by her uncle, and her fortune of £20,000 (then an enormous sum of money) by default falls to her husband on her death. Collins dedicated this novel toBryan Procter, poet and Commissioner for Lunacy, and was inspired by the case ofLouisa Nottidge[citation needed], who was abducted and imprisoned for the monetary convenience of her family.Women could be imprisoned in ""lunatic asylums""if they became embarrassing or inconvenient to their husbands or fathers. In addition, before the passage of theMarried Women's Property Act 1882, all of a wife's assets passed automatically to her husband.

The novel was first published inserialform in 1859—60, appearing inCharles Dickens' magazineAll the Year Round(UK) andHarper's Weekly(US). It was published in book form in 1860.[5]

The novel was extremely successful commercially, but contemporary critics were generally hostile.[5]Modern critics and readers regard it as Collins's best novel:[5]a view with which Collins concurred, as it is the only one of his novels named in his chosenepitaph: ""Author ofThe Woman in Whiteand other works of fiction"".[6]

The novel’s continuing influence in the 21st century led to the publication of a 12-novel series by American authorBrenda Clough, following up on the plot, with Marian Halcombe as the protagonist.[7]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9830,The Beautiful and Damned,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_and_Damned,"In 1913, Anthony Patch is a 25-year-oldHarvard Universityalumnus recently having returned fromRomeand now residing in New York City.[18]He is the presumptive heir to his dying grandfather's vast fortune. Through his friend Richard ""Dick"" Caramel, Anthony meets Gloria Gilbert, a beautifulflapperand ""jazz baby"" who is Dick's cousin.[3]Anthony begins courting her. The couple fall madly in love, with Gloria ecstatically exclaiming: ""Mother says that two souls are sometimes created together—and in love before they're born.""[19]After a whirlwind courtship, Anthony and Gloria marry.

For the first three years of their married life together, Anthony and Gloria vow to adhere to ""the magnificent attitude of not giving a damn... for what they chose to do and what consequences it brought. Not to be sorry, not to lose one cry of regret, to live according to a clear code of honor toward each other, and to seek the moment's happiness as fervently and persistently as possible.""[20]Pitted against each other's selfish attitudes, Gloria and Anthony's marital bliss evaporates. Once the couple's infatuation with each other fades, they begin to see their differences do more harm than good, as well as leaving each other with unfulfilled hopes. Over time, the disappointed couple become hedonistic and cynicallibertines.

When Anthony's grandfather learns of Anthony's dissipation, he disinherits him. DuringWorld War I, Anthony serves in theAmerican Expeditionary Forceswhile Gloria remains home alone until his return. While in army training, Anthony has an extramarital liaison with Dot Raycroft, a lower-class Southern woman.[21]After theAllied Powerssign anarmistice with Imperial Germanyin November 1918, Anthony returns to New York City and reunites with Gloria. When the struggle over the grandfather's inheritance concludes, Anthony wins his inheritance, but he has now become a hopelessalcoholic, and his wife has lost her beauty. The couple is now wealthy but morally and physically ruined.

At the end, Anthony Patch—echoing his grandfather—describes his inherited wealth as a consequence of his character rather than mere circumstance: ""Only a few months before people had been urging him to give in, to submit to mediocrity... But he had known that he was justified in his way of life—and he had stuck it out staunchly... 'I showed them... It was a hard fight, but I didn't give up and I came through!""[22]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23962,西遊記 (Chinese),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West,"The novel has 100 chapters that can be divided into four unequal parts.

The first part, which includes chapters 1–7, is a self-contained introduction to the main story. It deals entirely with the earlier exploits ofSun Wukong, amonkeyborn from a stone nourished by theFive Elements, who learns the art of theTao, 72 polymorphic transformations,[15]combat, and secrets of immortality, and whose guile and force earns him the nameQitian Dasheng(simplified Chinese:齐天大圣;traditional Chinese:齊天大聖), or ""Great Sage Equal to Heaven."" His powers grow to match the forces of all of the Eastern (Taoist) deities, and the prologue culminates in Sun's rebellion against Heaven, during a time when he garnered a post in thecelestial bureaucracy.Hubrisproves his downfall when theBuddhamanages to trap him under a mountain, sealing it with a talisman for 500 years. His given name loosely means ""Monkey Awakened toEmptiness(Śūnyatā)"", and appears right away in chapter 13 and becomesTang Sanzang's firstdisciplein the journey. The most intelligent, the most powerful, and the most violent of thedisciples, he is constantly reproved for his violence byTang Sanzang. Ultimately, he can only be controlled by a magic gold ring that Guanyin has placed around his head, which causes him unbearable headaches when Sanzang chants the Ring Tightening Mantra.  In the story, Wukong is an allegorical representation of the human mind and thought andimpulse, and is often nicknamed the ""Monkey mind"".

The second part (chapters 8–12) introducesTang Sanzangthrough his early biography and the background to his great journey. Dismayed that ""the land of the South(i.e.Tang China) knows only greed, hedonism, promiscuity, and sins,"" the Buddha instructs thebodhisattvaAvalokiteśvara(Guanyin) to search China for someone to take the Buddhist sutras of ""transcendence and persuasion for good will"" back. Part of this section also relates to how Tang Sanzang becomes a monk (as well as revealing his past life as a disciple of the Buddha named ""Golden Cicada"" (金蟬子Jīn Chánzi) and comes about being sent on this pilgrimage byEmperor Taizong, who previously escaped death with the help of an official in theUnderworld.  In the story, Tang Sanzang is considered an allegorical representation of the human heart.

The third and longest section of the work is chapters 13–99, an episodic adventure story in which Tang Sanzang sets out to bring back Buddhist scriptures from Leiyin Temple onVulture Peakin India, but encounters various evils along the way. The section is set in the sparsely populated lands along theSilk Roadbetween China and India. The geography described in the book is, however, almost entirely fantasy; once Tang Sanzang departsChang'an, the Tang capital, and crosses the frontier (somewhere inGansuprovince), he finds himself in a wilderness of deep gorges and tall mountains, inhabited by demons and animal spirits who regard him as a potential meal (since his flesh was believed to give immortality to whoever ate it), with the occasional hidden monastery or royal city-state amidst the harsh setting.

Episodes consist of 1–4 chapters and usually involve Tang Sanzang being captured and having his life threatened while his disciples try to find an ingenious (and often violent) way of liberating him. Although some of Tang Sanzang's predicaments are political and involve ordinary human beings, they more frequently consist of run-ins with various demons, many of whom turn out to be earthly manifestations of heavenly beings (whose sins will be negated by eating the flesh of Tang Sanzang) or animal-spirits with enough Taoist spiritual merit to assume semi-human forms.

Chapters 13–22 do not follow this structure precisely, as they introduceTang Sanzang's 3 otherdisciples, besidesSun Wukong, who inspired or goaded byGuanyin, meet and agree to serve him along the way in order to atone for their sins in their past lives.

Chapter 22, where Sha Wujing is introduced, also provides a geographical boundary, as the river that the travelers cross brings them into a new ""continent."" Chapters 23–86 take place in the wilderness, and consist of 24 episodes of varying length, each characterized by a different magical monster or evil magician. There are impassibly wide rivers,flaming mountains, a kingdom with an all-female population, a lair of seductive spider spirits, and many other scenarios. Throughout the journey, the four disciples have to fend off attacks on their master and teacher Tang Sanzang from various monsters and calamities.

It is strongly suggested that most of these calamities are engineered by fate and/or the Buddha, as, while the monsters who attack are vast in power and many in number, no real harm ever comes to the four travelers. Some of the monsters turn out to be escaped celestial beasts belonging to bodhisattvas or Taoist sages and deities. Towards the end of the book, there is a scene where the Buddha commands the fulfillment of the last disaster, because Tang Sanzang is one short of the 81 tribulations required before attainingBuddhahood.

In chapter 87, Tang Sanzang finally reaches the borderlands of India, and chapters 87–99 present magical adventures in a somewhat more mundane setting. At length, after a pilgrimage said to have taken fourteen years (the text actually only provides evidence for nine of those years, but presumably there was room to add additional episodes) they arrive at the half-real, half-legendary destination ofVulture Peak, where, in a scene simultaneously mystical and comic, Tang Sanzang receives the scriptures from the living Buddha.

Chapter 100, the final chapter, quickly describes the return journey to the Tang Empire, and the aftermath in which each traveller receives a reward in the form of posts in the bureaucracy of the heavens. Sun Wukong and Tang Sanzang both achieveBuddhahood, Sha Wujing becomes anarhat, Bai Long Ma is made anāgaand Zhu Bajie, whose good deeds have always been tempered by his greed, is promoted to an altar cleanser (i.e. eater of excess offerings at altars)."

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being ""worthy of the inventive genius"" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it ""might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago"", but that ""the unique power"" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, ""with all his little foibles"",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as ""rather a bore sometimes"", noting that descriptions of his foibles ""grows wearisome"".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author ""who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want"".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: ""It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.""[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes ""the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.""[34]

Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921–1923Stoll film series(all except ""The Five Orange Pips""),[35]the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(1930–1936),[36]the 1939–1950 radio seriesThe New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(all except ""The Beryl Coronet""),[37]and the BBC Sherlock Holmes1952–1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in theGranada TelevisionseriesSherlock Holmeswhich ran from 1984 until 1994.[38]The stories inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere dramatised forBBC Radio 4in 1990–1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series,[39]and were adapted as episodes of the radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(2005–2016).[40]The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26274,The Swiss Family Robinson,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swiss_Family_Robinson,"The novel opens with a Swiss family in the hold of a sailing ship, weathering a great storm. The ship's crew evacuates without them, so William, Elizabeth, and their four sons (Fritz, Ernest, Jack, and Francis) are left to survive alone. As the ship tosses about, William prays that God will spare them.

The ship survives the night, and the family finds themselves within sight of a tropicaldesert island. The following day, they decide to get to the island they can see beyond the reef. With much effort, they construct a vessel out of tubs. After they fill the tubs with food, ammunition, and other items of value they can safely carry, they row toward the island. Two dogs from the ship, Turk and Juno, swim beside them. The ship's cargo of livestock (including a cow, a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, a pig, chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons), guns and powder, carpentry tools, books, a disassembledpinnaceand provisions have survived.

Upon reaching the island, the family set up a makeshift camp. William knows that they must prepare for a long time on the island and his thoughts are as much on provisions for the future as on their immediate wants. William and his oldest son Fritz spend the next day exploring the island.

The family spends the next few days securing themselves against hunger. William and Fritz make several trips to the ship to bring everything useful from the vessel ashore. The domesticated animals on the ship are towed back to the island. There is also a great store of firearms and ammunition, hammocks for sleeping, carpenter's tools, lumber, cooking utensils, silverware, and dishes. Initially, they construct a treehouse, but as time passes (and after Elizabeth is injured climbing the stairs down from it), they settle in a more permanent dwelling in part of a cave. Fritz rescues a young Englishwoman named Jenny Montrose, who was shipwrecked elsewhere on their island.

The book covers more than ten years. William and the older boys explore various environments and develop homes and gardens at various sites about the island. Ultimately, the father wonders if they will ever see the rest of humanity again. Eventually, a British ship that is in search of Jenny Montrose anchors near the island and is discovered by the family. The captain is given the journal containing the story of their life on the island, which is eventually published. Several family members continue to live tranquilly on their island, while several return to Europe with the British.

The principal characters of the book (includingIsabelle de Montolieu's adaptations and continuation) are:

In the novel, the family is not called ""Robinson"" as their surname is not mentioned; the intention of the title is to compare them toRobinson Crusoe. However, in 1900,Jules VernepublishedThe Castaways of the Flag(alternatively known asSecond Fatherland), where he revisits the original shipwreck. In this sequel, of the family's final years on the original island, the family is called Zermatt[6](which is, as ""Robinson"", not a swiss name – however, ""Zermatten"" is).

The novels, in one form or another, have also been adapted numerous times, sometimes changing location and time period:

In 1963, the novel was dramatized by theTale Spinners for Childrenseries (United Artists RecordsUAC 11059) performed by the Famous Theatre Company."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20687,Pride and Prejudice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice,"In the early 19th century, theBennet familylives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton inHertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.

The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife"". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friendMr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance withElizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is ""not handsome enough"". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.

Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patronessLady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officerGeorge Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him unpleasantly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.

In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins inKent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the ""living"" his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerabledowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.

Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour ofDerbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visitPemberley, Darcy's estate, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Gardiner has paid Wickham. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted.











Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes ofPride and Prejudicebut Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initiallyFirst Impressions), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. ""After the success ofSense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.""

The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.""[8]The phrase ""pride and prejudice"" had been used over the preceding two centuries byJoseph Hall,Jeremy Taylor,Joseph AddisonandSamuel Johnson.[9][10]Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage inFanny Burney'sCecilia(1782), a novel she is known to have admired:

A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[12]Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. InPride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing.[12]Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[13]

The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1519,Much Ado about Nothing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing,"InMessina, a messenger brings news thatDon Pedrowill return that night from a successful battle, along with Claudio and Benedick. Beatrice asks the messenger about Benedick and mocks Benedick's ineptitude as a soldier. Leonato explains, ""There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.""[4]

On the soldiers' arrival, Don Pedro tells Leonato that they will stay a month at least, and Benedick and Beatrice resume their ""merry war"". Pedro's illegitimate brother, Don John, is also introduced. Claudio first lays eyes on Hero, and he informs Benedick of his intention to court her. Benedick, who openly despises marriage, tries to dissuade him. Don Pedro encourages the marriage. Benedick swears that he will never marry. Don Pedro laughs at him and tells him he will when he finds the right person.

Amasquerade ballis planned. Therein a disguised Don PedrowoosHero on Claudio's behalf. Don John uses this situation to sow chaos by telling Claudio that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself. Claudio rails against the entrapments of beauty. But the misunderstanding is later resolved, and Claudio is promised Hero's hand in marriage.

Meanwhile, Benedick and Beatrice have danced together, trading disparaging remarks under the cover of their masks. Beatrice knows who Benedick is under his mask, but Benedick does not recognize the mystery lady. Benedick is stung at hearing himself described as ""the prince's jester, a very dull fool"",[5]and yearns to be spared the company of ""Lady Tongue"".[5]Don Pedro and his men, bored at the prospect of waiting a week for the wedding, concoct a plan to match-make between Benedick and Beatrice. They arrange for Benedick to overhear a conversation in which they declare that Beatrice is madly in love with him but too afraid to tell him. Hero and Ursula likewise ensure that Beatrice overhears a conversation in which they discuss Benedick's undying love for her. Both Benedick and Beatrice are delighted to think that they are the object ofunrequited love, and both resolve to mend their faults and declare their love.

Meanwhile, Don John plots to stop the wedding, embarrass his brother, and wreak misery on Leonato and Claudio. He tells Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero is ""disloyal"",[5]and arranges for them to see his associate, Borachio, enter her bedchamber and engage amorously with her (it is actually Hero's chambermaid). Claudio and Don Pedro are duped, and Claudio vows to humiliate Hero publicly.

The next day, at the wedding, Claudio denounces Hero before the stunned guests and storms off with Don Pedro. Hero faints. A humiliated Leonato expresses his wish for her to die. The presiding friar intervenes, believing Hero innocent. He suggests that the family fake Hero's death to fill Claudio with remorse. Prompted by the stressful events, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Beatrice then asks Benedick to kill Claudio as proof of his devotion. Benedick hesitates but is swayed. Leonato and Antonio blame Claudio for Hero's supposed death and threaten him, to little effect. Benedick arrives and challenges him to a duel.

On the night of Don John's treachery, the local Watch overheard Borachio and Conrade discussing their ""treason""[5]and ""most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth"",[5]and arrested them therefore. Despite their ineptitude (headed by constableDogberry), they obtain a confession and inform Leonato of Hero's innocence. Don John has fled, but a force is sent to capture him. Remorseful and thinking Hero dead, Claudio agrees to her father's demand that he marry Antonio's daughter, ""almost the copy of my child that's dead"".[4]

After Claudio swears to marry this other bride, she is revealed to be Hero. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice and Benedick publicly confess their love for each other. Don Pedro taunts ""Benedick the married man"",[5]and Benedick counters that he finds the Prince sad, advising him: ""Get thee a wife"".[5]As the play draws to a close, a messenger arrives with news of Don John's capture, but Benedick proposes to postpone deciding Don John's punishment until tomorrow so that the couples can enjoy their newfound happiness. The couples dance and celebrate as the play ends.

Shakespeare's immediate source may have been one ofMatteo BandelloofMantua'sNovelle(""Tales""), possibly the translation into French byFrançois de Belleforest,[6]which dealt with the tribulations of Sir Timbreo and his betrothed Fenicia Lionata, in Messina, afterPeter III of Aragon's defeat ofCharles of Anjou.[7][8]Another version, featuring lovers Ariodante and Ginevra, with the servant Dalinda impersonating Ginevra on the balcony, appears in Book VLudovico Ariosto'sOrlando Furioso(published in an English translation in 1591).[9]The character of Benedick has a counterpart in a commentary on marriage inOrlando Furioso.[10]But the witty wooing of Beatrice and Benedick is apparently original and very unusual in style and syncopation.[6]Edmund Spensertells one version of the Claudio–Hero plot inThe Faerie Queene(Book II, Canto iv).[11]

According to the earliest printed text,Much Ado About Nothingwas ""sundry times publicly acted"" before 1600. The play likely debuted in the autumn or winter of 1598–99.[1]The earliest recorded performances are two at Court in the winter of 1612–13, during festivities preceding theWedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate(14 February 1613).[12]In 1600, the stationersAndrew WiseandWilliam Aspleypublished the play inquarto.[13]This was the only edition prior to theFirst Folioin 1623.[14]

The play is predominantly written in prose.[15]The substantial verse sections achieve a sense of decorum.[16]

Much Ado About Nothingis set inMessina, a port city on the island ofSicily, when Sicily isruled by Aragon.[17]Its action takes place mainly at the home and grounds of Leonato's Estate.

Benedick and Beatrice quickly became the main interest of the play. They are considered the leading roles even though their relationship is given equal or lesser weight in the script than Claudio's and Hero's situation.[18]Charles Iwrote, 'Benedick and Beatrice' beside the title of the play in his copy of theSecond Folio.[19]The provocative treatment of gender is central and should be considered in itsRenaissancecontext.[20]This was reflected and emphasized in certain plays of the period but was also challenged.[21]Amussen[22]notes that the undoing of traditional gender clichés seems to have inflamed anxieties about the erosion of social order. It seems that comic drama could be a means of calming such anxieties.[citation needed]Ironically, the play's popularity suggests that this only increased interest in such behavior.[clarification needed][citation needed]Benedick wittily gives voice to male anxieties about women's ""sharp tongues and proneness to sexual lightness"".[21]In the play's patriarchal society, the men's loyalties are governed by conventional codes of honour, camaraderie, and a sense of superiority over women.[21]Assumptions that women are by nature prone to inconstancy are shown in the repeated jokes aboutcuckoldry, and partly explain Claudio's readiness to believe the slander against Hero.[citation needed]This stereotype is turned on its head in Balthasar's song ""Sigh No More"", which presents men as the deceitful and inconstant sex that women must abide.[citation needed]

Several characters seem obsessed with the idea that a man cannot know whether his wife is faithful and that women can take full advantage of this.[citation needed]Don John plays upon Claudio's pride and fear of cuckoldry, leading to the disastrous first wedding. Many of the men readily believe that Hero is impure; even her father condemns her with very little evidence. This motif runs through the play, often referring to horns (a symbol of cuckoldry).

In contrast, Balthasar's song ""Sigh No More"" tells women to accept men's infidelity and continue to live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message.[citation needed]This is supported by Benedick's cynical comments about the song, comparing it to a howling dog. InKenneth Branagh's1993 film, Balthasar sings it beautifully: it is given a prominent role in the opening and finale, and the women seem to embrace its message.[23]

The play has many examples of deception and self-deception. The games and tricks played on people often have the best intentions: to make people fall in love, to help someone get what they want, or to lead someone to realize their mistake. But not all are well-meant: Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself, and Borachio meets 'Hero' (actually Margaret) in Hero's bedroom window. These modes of deceit play into a complementary theme of emotional manipulation, the ease with which the characters' sentiments are redirected and their propensities exploited as a means to an end.[citation needed]The characters' feelings for each other are played as vehicles to reach the goal of engagement rather than as an end in themselves.[citation needed]

Characters are constantly pretending to be others or mistaken for others. Margaret is mistaken for Hero, leading to Hero's disgrace. During a masked ball (in which everyone must wear a mask), Beatrice rants about Benedick to a masked man who is actually Benedick, but she acts unaware of this. During the same celebration, Don Pedro pretends to be Claudio and courts Hero for him. After Hero is proclaimed dead, Leonato orders Claudio to marry his 'niece', who is actually Hero.

Another motif is the play on the wordsnothingandnoting. These were near-homophonesin Shakespeare's day.[24]Taken literally, the title implies that a great fuss ('much ado') is made of something insignificant ('nothing'), such as the unfounded claims of Hero's infidelity and that Benedick and Beatrice are in love with each other.Nothingis also adouble entendre: 'an O-thing' (or 'n othing' or 'no thing') was Elizabethan slang for ""vagina"", derived from women having 'nothing' between their legs.[6][25][26]The title can also be understood asMuch Ado About Noting: much of the action centres on interest in others and the critique of others, written messages, spying, and eavesdropping. This attention is mentioned several times directly, particularly concerning 'seeming', 'fashion', and outward impressions.

Examples of noting as noticing occur in the following instances: (1.1.131–132)

and (4.1.154–157)."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/550,Silas Marner,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Marner,"The novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a smallCalvinistcongregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street inNorthern England. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation's funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two pieces of evidence implicate Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery of the bag formerly containing the money in his own house. There is the strong suggestion that Silas's best friend, William Dane, has framed him, since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Lots are drawn in the belief – also shared by Silas – that God will direct the process and establish the truth, but they indicate that Silas is guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and marries William instead. With his life shattered, his trust in God lost, and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city for a rural area where he is unknown.

Silas travels south to theMidlandsand settles near the rural village of Raveloe inWarwickshirewhere he lives isolated and alone, choosing to have only minimal contact with the residents beyond his work as a linen weaver. He devotes himself wholeheartedly to his craft and comes to adore the coins, many of them gold, he earns and hoards from his weaving.

One foggy night, Silas's two bags of coins are stolen by Dunstan (""Dunsey"") Cass, the dissolute younger son of Squire Cass, the town's leading landowner. On discovering the theft, Silas sinks into a deep depression despite the villagers' attempts to aid him. Dunsey disappears, but the community makes no connection to the theft, since he has vanished several times before, and he accidentally killed the horse he was supposed to sell for his elder brother, Godfrey.

Godfrey Cass harbours a secret past. He is married to, but estranged from, Molly Farren, anopium-addicted working-class woman living in another town. This secret prevents Godfrey from marrying Nancy Lammeter, a virtuous, beautiful young middle-class woman. On a winter's night, Molly tries to make her way to Squire Cass's New Year's Eve party with her two-year-old girl to announce that she is Godfrey's wife. On the way, she takes opium, collapses in the snow and dies from the cold. The child wanders into Silas's house. Silas follows the child's tracks in the snow and discovers the dead woman. When he goes to the party for help, Godfrey goes to the scene of the accident, but resolves to tell no one that Molly was his wife. Molly's death enables Godfrey to marry Nancy; he promises to abandon his dissolute life and reform.

Silas keeps the child and names herHephzibah(nicknamed Eppie) after his deceased mother and sister. Eppie changes Silas's life completely. He has been robbed of his material gold, but thinks that he has it returned to him symbolically in the form of the golden-haired child. Godfrey Cass continues to conceal the fact of his previous marriage, but keeps an eye on his child. He aids Marner in caring for Eppie with occasional financial gifts. Dolly Winthrop, Silas's kindly neighbour, provides more practical help and support in bringing up the child. Eppie draws Silas into village society.

Sixteen years pass. Eppie considers Silas her father. Silas has found a place in the rural society and a purpose in life. Meanwhile, Godfrey and Nancy are childless, after the death of their only baby. Eventually, the skeleton of Dunstan Cass and Silas's money are found at the bottom of the stone quarry near Silas's home after the water level goes down, and the money is duly returned to Silas. Shocked by this revelation, and coming to the realisation of his own conscience, Godfrey confesses to Nancy that Molly was his first wife and that Eppie is his child. They offer to raise her as a gentleman's daughter, much to Silas's distress. Eppie politely but firmly refuses, saying, ""I can't think o' no happiness without him.""

With his money restored, Silas takes Eppie to revisit Lantern Yard, but his old neighbourhood has been ""swept away"" in the intervening years; the place has been replaced by a large factory. No one knows what happened to Lantern Yard's inhabitants. However, Silas contentedly resigns himself to not knowing and now leads a happy existence among his self-made family and friends. In the end, Eppie marries a local boy she has grown up with, Dolly's son Aaron, and they move into Silas's house, which has been newly improved courtesy of Godfrey.

Lawrence Jay Dessner has drawn connections between the biographical circumstances of Eliot's life in relation to events in the novel.[1]Bruce K. Martin has discussed Eliot's use of Godfrey Cass as ""both parallel and foil"" to Silas Marner in the structure of the novel.[2]Fred C. Thomson has examined the multiple levels of the idea of alienation in the novel.[3]Joseph Wiesenfarth has noted undercurrents of myth and legend, incorporated into a 'realistic' context, along with contrasts of responsible and irresponsible behaviour in the contrasting fates of Silas Marner and the Cass brothers.[4]David Sonstroem has studied ideas of chance andDarwinianthinking in the context of the plot and character fates in the novel.[5]Susan Stewart has looked at the influence of folktales and ideology related to 'work' vs 'labour' in the novel.[6]Ian Milner has examined two overarching themes of Silas Marner's 'loss and recovery of his humanity', and of a conflict between stated moral values and the social realities juxtaposed with them.[7]Robert H. Dunham has analysed the influence of the ideas and philosophy ofWilliam Wordsworthon the novel.[8]Brian Swann has examined mythic and religious undertones in the novel.[9]Jeff Nunokawa analyses ideas about physical touch, with respect to Silas Marner's handling of his gold compared to his raising of Eppie, and connects them to sexual and sensual themes.[10]Kate E. Brown has discussed overarching themes of time and temporality, with respect to the interlocked stories of Godfrey Cass and Silas Marner.[11]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26654,Peter and Wendy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy,"The play and its novelisation differ in some details of the story, but have much in common. In both versions, Peter Pan[a]makes night-time calls on the Darlings' house inBloomsbury,[4]listening in on Mrs.Mary Darling's bedtime stories by the open window. One night Peter is spotted and, while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On returning to claim it, Peter accidentally wakes Mary's daughter, Wendy. She succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him using thread and needle, and Peter learns that she knows many bedtime stories. He invites her toNeverlandto be a mother to his gang, theLost Boys, children who were lost when they fell out of their prams. Wendy agrees, and her younger brothers John and Michael go along.

After their magical flight to Neverland, the children are blown out of the air by a pirate cannon and Wendy is nearly shot and killed by the Lost BoyTootles, because Peter's fairy companion, Tinker Bell, is jealous of her and tricks him into thinking that she is a bird. The only reason that Wendy is spared is because she is protected by an acorn pendant she wears around her neck given to Wendy by Peter in exchange for a ""kiss"" (actually a thimble) she gave him. Peter and the Lost Boys build a little house for Wendy to live in while she recuperates.[b]Soon John and Michael adopt the ways of the Lost Boys and all three of the Darling siblings begin to forget their parents and home.

Peter welcomes Wendy to his underground home, and she assumes the role of mother figure. Peter takes the Darlings on several adventures. At Mermaids' Lagoon, Peter and the Lost Boys save the Native chief's daughter,Tiger Lily, from Marooner's Rock and become involved in a battle with the pirates, includingCaptain Hook, Peter's nemesis. He is named after the hook that replaced his right hand that Peter cut off in a fight. From thereon, Hook has been hunted by the crocodile which ate his hand after it fell into the water and now wants to eat the rest of him. The crocodile also swallowed a ticking clock, so Hook is wary of all ticking sounds. Peter is wounded when Hook claws him. He believes he will die, as the tide rises and Marooner's Rock will become submerged. However, ""the Neverbird"", a nearby mother bird, allows him to use her nest as a boat and Peter sails home.

In gratitude for Peter saving Tiger Lily, her tribe guards his home from the next imminent pirate attack. Meanwhile, Wendy begins to fall in love with Peter and asks him what kind of feelings he has for her. Peter says that he has ""the feelings of a devoted son"", disappointing Wendy. One day, while telling stories to the Lost Boys and her brothers, Wendy recalls her parents and decides to return to England. Unbeknownst to Peter, Wendy and the boys are captured by Captain Hook, who massacres the natives and poisons Peter's ""medicine"" while the boy is asleep. When Peter awakes, he learns fromTinker Bellthat Wendy has been kidnapped – in an effort to please Wendy, he goes to drink his medicine. Peter does not believe Tink about the poison (as he is confident the pirate could not have entered their secret lair without him noticing), so instead she drinks it herself, causing her near death. Tink says that she could be saved if children believed in fairies. In the play, Peterturns to the audienceand begs those who believe in fairies to clap their hands. In the novel, Peter speaks to all the children currently asleep and dreaming of the Neverland.

En route to the ship, Peter encounters the crocodile, which is silent and Peter concludes the clock must have run down; Peter decides to copy the creature's tick, so any animals will recognise it and leave him unharmed. He does not realise that he is still mimicking the ticking as he boards the ship, where Hook and his crew cower, mistaking him for the crocodile. While the pirates search for the creature, Peter sneaks into the cabin to steal the keys and frees the Lost Boys. When the pirates investigate a noise in the cabin, Peter defeats them. When Peter reveals himself, he and Hook begin to battle, and Peter easily wins. He kicks Hook into the jaws of the waiting crocodile, and Hook dies with the satisfaction that Peter literally kicked him off the ship, which Hook considers ""bad form"". Peter takes control of the ship, and sails the seas back to London.

Before Wendy and her brothers arrive at their house, Peter flies ahead, to try and bar the window so Wendy will think her mother forgot her. However, after learning of Mrs. Darling's distress, he bitterly leaves the window open and flies away. The Darlings reunite with their parents. Wendy then presents all the lost boys to her parents, who decide to adopt them. Peter returns briefly, and meets Mrs. Darling. She offers to adopt Peter as well, but Peter refuses, afraid they will ""catch him and make him a man."" It is hinted that Mary knew Peter when she was a girl; she always has a kiss in the corner of her mouth no one can reach, but Peter takes it with him as he leaves.

Peter promises to return for Wendy and take her to Neverland for a week every spring. The play's final scene takes place a year later when Wendy is preparing to return there, after the spring cleaning has taken place. Tinker Bell has died during this year since fairies are short-lived creatures. However, Peter has already forgotten about Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and even Hook when Wendy returns, and he does not understand Wendy's wistful wish that she could take him back with her.

Four years after the premiere of the original production ofPeter Pan, Barrie wrote an additional scene entitledWhen Wendy Grew Up, An Afterthought, later included in the final chapter ofPeter and Wendy, and later still published as a separate work in 1957.[5]

In this scene, Peter returns for Wendy years later, but she is now grown up with a daughter of her own named Jane. It is also revealed that Wendy married a Lost Boy, although this is not mentioned in the novel, and it is never revealed which one she did marry.[c]When Peter learns that Wendy ""betrayed"" him by growing up, he is heartbroken until Jane agrees to come to Neverland as Peter's new mother. In the novel it is mentioned that when Jane grows up, Peter takes her daughter Margaret to Neverland. This cycle will go on forever as long as children are ""gay and innocent and heartless"".[d]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6688,The Mill on the Floss,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mill_on_the_Floss,"The novel begins in the late 1820s or early 1830s – several historical references place the events in the book after theNapoleonic Warsbut before theReform Act 1832.[2](In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an ""auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago"", placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel's composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss theDuke of Wellingtonand his ""conduct in the Catholic Question"", a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington becamePrime Ministerand supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man,George Henry Lewes.[citation needed]

Maggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents' marriage. Her relationship with her older brother, Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg's and assumed fiancé of Maggie's cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads.

Tom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie's desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom's pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie's idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver's rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem's father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver's death, intensify Tom's and Maggie's differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to devote himself to a life of business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family's former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading ofThomas à Kempis'sThe Imitation of Christ.

This renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie's heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip's and Maggie's attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents.

Several years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg's resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem's friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip's love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip's place.

When Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg's, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively.

Maggie's brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace.

Like other novels by George Eliot,The Mill on the Flossarticulates the tension between circumstances and the spiritual energies of individual characters struggling against those circumstances. A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's inability to keep himself from ""going to law"", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.

Critics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughoutThe Mill on the Floss, claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that ""[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized."" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, ""[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.""[5]

The story was adapted as a film,The Mill on the Floss, in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starringChristopher Blake,Pippa Guard,Judy Cornwell,Ray SmithandAnton Lesser.

In 1994,Helen Edmundsonadapted the book for the stage, in a production performed byShared Experience.

A television film adaptation of the novel was first aired on 1 January 1997. Maggie Tulliver is portrayed byEmily Watsonand Mr Tulliver byBernard Hill. The production was filmed at the historicChatham DockyardinKentfor exterior street scenes.[6]

The Emperor Kiritsubo then hears of a woman (Lady Fujitsubo), formerly a princess of the preceding emperor, who resembles his deceased concubine, and later she becomes one of his wives. Genji loves her first as a stepmother, but later as a woman, and they fall in love with each other. Genji is frustrated by his forbidden love for the Lady Fujitsubo and is on bad terms with his own wife (Aoi no Ue, the Lady Aoi). He engages in a series of love affairs with many other women. These are however unfulfilling, as in most cases his advances are rebuffed, or his lover dies suddenly, or he becomes bored.

Genji visits Kitayama, a rural hilly area north of Kyoto, where he finds a beautiful ten-year-old girl. He is fascinated by this little girl (Murasaki no Ue), and discovers that she is a niece of the Lady Fujitsubo. Finally he kidnaps her, brings her to his own palace and educates her to be like the Lady Fujitsubo, who is his womanly ideal. During this time Genji also meets Lady Fujitsubo secretly, and she bears his son, Reizei. Everyone except the two lovers believes the father of the child is the Emperor Kiritsubo. Later the boy becomes theCrown Princeand Lady Fujitsubo becomes the Empress, but Genji and Lady Fujitsubo swear to keep the child's true parentage secret.

Genji and his wife, Lady Aoi, reconcile. She gives birth to a son but dies soon after. Genji is sorrowful but finds consolation in Murasaki, whom he marries. Genji's father, the Emperor Kiritsubo, dies. He is succeeded by his son Suzaku, whose mother (Kokiden), together with Kiritsubo's political enemies, take power in the court. Then another of Genji's secret love affairs is exposed: Genji and a concubine of the Emperor Suzaku are discovered while meeting in secret. The Emperor Suzaku confides his personal amusement at Genji's exploits with the woman (Oborozukiyo), but is duty-bound to punish Genji even though he is his half-brother. He exiles Genji to the town ofSumain ruralHarima Province(now part ofKobeinHyōgo Prefecture). There, a prosperous man known as the Akashi Novice (because he is fromAkashiinSettsu Province) entertains Genji, and Genji has an affair with Akashi's daughter. She gives birth to Genji's only daughter, who will later become the Empress.

In the capital, the Emperor Suzaku is troubled by dreams of his late father, Kiritsubo, and something begins to affect his eyes. Meanwhile, his mother, Kokiden, grows ill, which weakens her influence over the throne, and leads to the Emperor ordering Genji to be pardoned. Genji returns to Kyoto. His son by Lady Fujitsubo, Reizei, becomes the emperor. The new Emperor Reizei knows Genji is his real father, and raises Genji's rank to the highest possible.

However, when Genji turns 40 years old, his life begins to decline. His political status does not change, but his love and emotional life begin to incrementally diminish as middle age takes hold. He marries another wife,the Third Princess(known as Onna san no miya in the Seidensticker version, or Nyōsan in Waley's). Genji's nephew, Kashiwagi, later forces himself on the Third Princess, and she bearsKaoru(who, in a similar situation to that of Reizei, is legally known as the son of Genji). Genji's new marriage changes his relationship with Murasaki, who had expressed her wish of becoming a nun (bikuni) though the wish was rejected by Genji.

Genji's beloved Murasaki dies. In the following chapter,Maboroshi(""Illusion""), Genji contemplates how fleeting life is. The next chapter is titledKumogakure(""Vanished into the Clouds""), which is left blank, but implies the death of Genji.

Chapter 45–54 are known as the ""Uji Chapters"". These chapters follow Kaoru and his best friend, Niou. Niou is an imperial prince, the son of Genji's daughter, the current Empress now that Reizei has abdicated the throne, while Kaoru is known to the world as Genji's son but is in fact fathered by Genji's nephew. The chapters involve Kaoru and Niou's rivalry over several daughters of an imperial prince who lives inUji, a place some distance away from the capital. The tale ends abruptly, with Kaoru wondering if Niou is hiding Kaoru's former lover away from him. Kaoru has sometimes been called the firstanti-heroin literature.[8]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40409,Os Maias: episodios da vida romantica (Portuguese),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Maias,"The book begins with the characters Carlos Eduardo da Maia, Afonso da Maia and Vilaça in the family's old house with plans to reconstruct it. The house, nicknamed ""Ramalhete"" (bouquet), is located in Lisbon. Its name comes from a tiled panel depicting a bouquet of sunflowers set on the place where the stone with the coat of arms should be. As the introductory scene goes on, the story of the Maia family is given, in a flashback style by Afonso.

Afonso da Maia, a well-mannered Portuguese man, is married to Maria Eduarda Runa and their marriage only produces one son – Pedro da Maia. Pedro da Maia, who is given the typical romantic education, becomes a weak, low-spirited and sensitive man. He is very close to his mother and is inconsolable after her death. He only recuperates when he meets a beautiful woman called Maria Monforte with whom he gets married despite his father's objection. The marriage produces a son, Carlos Eduardo, and a daughter, whose name is not revealed until much later. Some time later, Maria Monforte falls in love with Tancredo (an Italian who is staying at their house after being accidentally wounded by Pedro) and runs away to Italy with him, betraying Pedro and taking her daughter along. When Pedro finds out, he is heartbroken and goes with his son to his father's house where he, during the night, commits suicide. Carlos stays at his grandfather's house and is educated by him, receiving the typical British education (as Afonso would have liked to have raised his son).

Back in the present, Carlos is a wealthy, elegant gentleman who is a doctor and opens his own office. Later he meets a gorgeous woman while walking with Steinbroken, a Finland's minister, near the Aterro. After many comical and disastrous adventures he finally discovers the woman's name, Maria Eduarda. Later, while Maria Eduarda was not at home, her daughter, Rosa, gets sick, and Dâmaso, Carlos's friend, finds Carlos to help her. This leads to Maria Eduarda calling him a few days later after Rosa gets a bit sick again, and after taking care of Rosa, Maria Eduarda has a conversation with Carlos. They become friends and start having regular meetings. After dozens of friendly meetings and other events, Maria reveals that she is also in love with Carlos, and they become lovers. Eventually Carlos finds out that Maria lied to him about her past and he starts fearing the worst. Mr. Guimarães, a good friend of Maria's mother and an uncle-like figure to her, talks to Ega and gives him a box meant to be given ""to your friend Carlos... or to his sister!"". Ega does not understand this statement, because Carlos supposedly never had a sister. Ega is horrified and in a state of shock when he realizes that Maria is Carlos's sister. Ega, in despair, tells everything to Vilaça (the Maia family attorney) who informs Carlos about the incest. Carlos doesn't inform his grandfather, but Afonso seems to discover it by himself and gradually falls more and more ill. However, Carlos cannot forget his love and does not say anything to Maria. Afonso dies because ofapoplexy. At last, Carlos informs his newfound sister that they are siblings and that they cannot live like this anymore. Maria says one last goodbye to her former lover and to her friends before going away to an unknown future. Carlos, to forget his tragedies, goes on a trip around the world.

The book ends with a famous scene in Portugal, where Carlos returns to Lisbon 10 years after he left. He meets Ega and has a boys-only night to have fun together. At one point, they agree that there is nothing in the world that is worth running for. Ironically, as soon as they go out to the street, they realize that they missed the last cable car and they start running after it, shouting ""We can still catch it, we can still catch it...!"", closing the story in a both philosophical and comical way.

The screenplay was adapted by the renownedsoap operawriterMaria Adelaide Amaraland directed byLuiz Fernando Carvalho.

Before their marriage Marguerite took revenge upon the Marquis de St. Cyr, who had ordered her brother beaten for his romantic interest in the Marquis' daughter, with the unintended consequence that the Marquis and his sons wereguillotined. When Percy found out, he became estranged from his wife. Marguerite, for her part, became disillusioned with Percy's shallow,dandyishlifestyle.

Meanwhile, the ""League of the Scarlet Pimpernel"", asecret societyof twenty English aristocrats, ""one to command, and nineteen to obey"", is engaged in rescuing their French counterparts from the daily executions of theReign of Terror. Their leader, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel, takes hisnom de guerrefrom thesmall, wayside red flowerhe draws on his messages. Despite being the talk of London society, only his followers and possibly thePrince of Walesknow the Pimpernel's true identity. Like many others, Marguerite is entranced by the Pimpernel's daring exploits.

At a ball attended by the Blakeneys, Percy's verse about the ""elusive Pimpernel"" becomes an instant success. But Marguerite is beingblackmailedbyCitizen Chauvelin, the wily new French envoy to England: Chauvelin's agents have stolen a letter proving that her beloved brother Armand is in league with the Pimpernel. Chauvelin offers to trade Armand's life for her help against the Pimpernel. Contemptuous of her seemingly witless and unloving husband, Marguerite does not go to him for help or advice. Instead, she passes along information which enables Chauvelin to learn the Pimpernel's true identity.

Later that night, Marguerite finally tells her husband of the terrible danger threatening her brother and pleads for his help. Percy promises to save him. After Percy unexpectedly leaves for France, Marguerite discovers to her horror (and simultaneous delight) thatheis the Pimpernel. He had hidden behind the persona of a dull, slow-witted fop to deceive the world. He had not told Marguerite because of his worry that she might betray him, as she had the Marquis de St. Cyr. Desperate to save her husband, she decides to pursue Percy to France to warn him that Chauvelin knows his identity and his purpose. She persuades Sir Andrew Ffoulkes to accompany her, but because of the tide and the weather, neither they nor Chauvelin can leave immediately.

AtCalais, Percy openly approaches Chauvelin in theChat gris, a decrepit inn whose owner is in Percy's pay. Despite Chauvelin's best efforts, the Englishman escapes by offering Chauvelin a pinch ofsnuff, which turns out to be pure pepper. Through a bold plan executed right under Chauvelin's nose, Percy rescues Marguerite's brother Armand and the Comte de Tournay, the father of a schoolfriend of Marguerite's. Marguerite pursues Percy right to the very end, determined to either warn him or share his fate. Percy, heavily disguised, is captured by Chauvelin, who does not recognise him, so he is able to escape.

With Marguerite's love and courage amply proven, Percy's ardour is rekindled. Safely back on board their schooner, theDay Dream, the happily reconciled couple returns to England. Sir Andrew marries the count's daughter, Suzanne."

Enfield recounts to Utterson that, months ago, in the eerie silence of three o'clock in the morning, he witnessed a malevolent-looking man named Edward Hyde deliberately trample a young girl after a seemingly minor collision. Enfield forced Hyde to pay her family £100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought Enfield to this door and gave him a cheque signed by a reputablegentlemanlater revealed to be Doctor Henry Jekyll, Utterson's friend and client. Utterson fears Hyde isblackmailingJekyll, as Jekyll recently changed his will to make Hyde the sole beneficiary in the event of Jekyll's death or disappearance. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with Jekyll, Jekyll says he can get rid of Hyde when he wants and asks him to drop the matter.

A year later in October, a servant sees Hyde beat Sir Danvers Carew, another one of Utterson's clients, to death and leave behind half a broken cane. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find the other half of the broken cane, which Utterson recognises as one he had given to Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who produces a note allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologising for the trouble that he has caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde.

For two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner, appearing almost rejuvenated, but in early January, he abruptly begins refusing all visitors, deepening the mystery and concern surrounding his behaviour. Dr Hastie Lanyon, a mutual friend of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a conversation with Jekyll at his laboratory window. Jekyll suddenly slams the window shut and disappears, shocking and concerning Utterson.

In early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr Poole, visits Utterson and says Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and Poole forcefully break into the laboratory, their hearts pounding with dread, only to find Hyde's lifeless body grotesquely draped in Jekyll's clothes, a scene suggesting a horrifying and desperate suicide. They find a letter from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's.

Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drink an elixir that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter explains he held himself to strict moral standards publicly, but indulged in unstated vices and struggled with shame. He found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed body, Hyde, was evil, self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. Despite this, one night he had a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, his desires having been caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to Lanyon in Jekyll's hand, asking his friend to bring chemicals from his laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses of the serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Utterson.

Eventually, the supply of salt used in the serum ran low, and subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll speculated that the original ingredient had some impurity that made it work. Realising that he would stay transformed as Hyde, Jekyll wrote out a full account of the events. Jekyll concludes by confessing that he is uncertain whether Hyde will face execution or muster the courage to end his own life, but it no longer matters to him. Jekyll's consciousness is fading fast, and whatever fate awaits, it is Hyde's alone to endure.

Gabriel John Utterson, a lawyer, has been a close loyal friend of Jekyll and Lanyon for many years. Utterson is a measured and, at all times, emotionless bachelor – who nonetheless seems believable, trustworthy, tolerant of the faults of others, and indeed genuinely likeable. However, Utterson is not immune to guilt, as he is quick to investigate and judge an interest in others' downfalls, which creates a spark of interest not only in Jekyll but also regarding Hyde. He concludes that human downfall results from indulging oneself in topics of interest. As a result of this line of reasoning, he lives life as a recluse and ""dampens his taste for the finer items of life"". Utterson concludes that Jekyll lives life as he wishes by enjoying his occupation."

Witwoud and Petulant appear and Mirabell is informed that should Lady Wishfort marry, he will lose £6000 of Millamant'sinheritance. He will only get this money if he can get Lady Wishfort'sconsentto his and Millamant's marriage.

Act 2 is set in St. James’ Park. Mrs. Fainall and Mrs. Marwood are discussing their hatred of men. Fainall appears and accuses Mrs. Marwood (with whom he is having anaffair) of loving Mirabell (which she does). Meanwhile, Mrs. Fainall (Mirabell's former lover) tells Mirabell that she hates her husband, and they begin to plot to deceive Lady Wishfort into giving her consent to the marriage. Millamant appears in the park and, angry about the previous night (when Mirabell was confronted by Lady Wishfort), she tells Mirabell of her displeasure in his plan, which she only has a vague idea about. After she leaves, the newly wed servants appear and Mirabell reminds them of their roles in the plan.

Acts 3, 4 and 5 are all set in the home of Lady Wishfort. We are introduced to Lady Wishfort who is encouraged by Foible to marry the supposed Sir Rowland – Mirabell's supposed uncle – so that Mirabell will lose his inheritance. Sir Rowland is, however, Waitwell in disguise, and the plan is to entangle Lady Wishfort in a marriage which cannot go ahead, because it would be bigamy, not to mention a social disgrace (Waitwell is only a serving man, Lady Wishfort an aristocrat). Mirabell will offer to help her out of the embarrassing situation if she consents to his marriage. Later, Mrs. Fainall discusses this plan with Foible, but this is overheard by Mrs. Marwood. She later tells the plan to Fainall, who decides that he will take his wife's money and go away with Mrs. Marwood.

Mirabell and Millamant, equally strong-willed, discuss in detail the conditions under which they would accept each other in marriage (otherwise known as the ""proviso scene""), showing the depth of their feeling for each other. Mirabell finally proposes to Millamant and, with Mrs. Fainall's encouragement (almost consent, as Millamant knows of their previous relations), Millamant accepts. Mirabell leaves as Lady Wishfort arrives, and she lets it be known that she wants Millamant to marry her nephew, Sir Wilfull Witwoud, who has just arrived from the countryside. Lady Wishfort later gets a letter telling her about the Sir Rowland plot. Sir Rowland takes the letter and accuses Mirabell of trying to sabotage their wedding. Lady Wishfort agrees to let Sir Rowland bring a marriage contract that night.

By Act 5, Lady Wishfort has found out the plot, and Fainall has had Waitwell arrested. Mrs. Fainall tells Foible that her previous affair with Mirabell is now public knowledge. Lady Wishfort appears with Mrs. Marwood, whom she thanks for unveiling the plot. Fainall then appears and uses the information of Mrs. Fainall's previous affair with Mirabell and Millamant's contract to marry him toblackmailLady Wishfort, telling her that she should never marry and that she is to transfer her fortune to him. Lady Wishfort offers Mirabell her consent to the marriage if he can save her fortune and honour. Mirabell calls on Waitwell who brings a contract from the time before the marriage of the Fainalls in which Mrs. Fainall gives all her property, in trust, to Mirabell. This neutralises the blackmail attempts, after which Mirabell restores Mrs. Fainall's property to her possession and then is free to marry Millamant with the full £12000 inheritance.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4039,"Volpone; Or, The Fox",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volpone,"Volpone(The Fox)is a Venetian gentleman who pretends to be on his deathbed after a long illness in order to dupe Voltore(The Vulture), Corbaccio(The Raven)and Corvino(The Crow), three men who aspire to inherit his fortune. In their turns, each man arrives to Volpone's house bearing a luxurious gift, intent upon having his name inscribed to the will of Volpone, as his heir. Mosca(The Fly), Volpone's parasite servant, encourages each of the visitors to believe that he has been named heir to Volpone's fortune. Mosca even persuades Corbaccio to disinherit his own son in favor of Volpone.

To Volpone, Mosca mentions that Corvino has a beautiful wife, Celia. Disguised as Scoto the Mountebank, Volpone goes to see Celia. Corvino drives away ""Scoto"" (Volpone), who then becomes insistent that he must possess Celia as his own. Mosca deceives Corvino into believing that the moribund Volpone will be cured of his illness if he lies in bed beside a young woman. Believing that Volpone has been rendered impotent by his illness, Corvino offers his wife in order that, when he is revived, Volpone will recognise Corvino as his sole heir.

Just before Corvino and Celia are due to arrive at Volpone's house, Corbaccio's son Bonario arrives to catch his father in the act of disinheriting him. Mosca guides Bonario to a sideroom, and Volpone and Celia are left alone. Upon failing to seduce Celia with fantastic promises of luxury and wealth, Volpone attempts to rape her. Bonario comes forward to rescue Celia. In the ensuing trial at court, the truth of the matter is well-buried by Voltore, using his prowess as a lawyer to convince the Avocatori, with false evidence given by Mosca, Volpone and the other dupes.

There are episodes involving the English travellers Sir and Lady Politic Would-Be and Peregrine. Sir Politic constantly talks of plots and his outlandish business plans, while Lady Would-Be annoys Volpone with her ceaseless talking. Mosca co-ordinates a mix-up between them which leaves Peregrine, a more sophisticated traveller, feeling offended. He humiliates Sir Politic by telling him he is to be arrested for sedition and making him hide inside a giant tortoise shell.

Volpone insists on disguising himself and having it announced that he has died and willed his wealth to Mosca, which enrages the would-be heirs Voltore, Corbaccio and Corvino, and everyone returns to court to dispute the will of Volpone, who becomes entangled in the circumstances of the plots that he and Mosca devised. Despite Volpone's pleas, Mosca refuses to relinquish his new role as a rich man. Volpone reveals himself and his deceits in order to topple the rich Mosca. In the event, Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca and Volpone himself finally are punished.

The play appeared inquartoin early 1607, printed byGeorge Eldfor publisherThomas Thorpe. The quarto contains Jonson's dedication toOxfordandCambridge, as well as a great number ofcommendatory verses, in English and Latin, by fellow-poets such asFrancis BeaumontandJohn Fletcher. Its next appearance was in thefolioof 1616, and the latter, presumably having been subject to Jonson's careful review, forms the basis of most modern editions.

The play premiered at theGlobe Theatrein Spring 1606. It was performed by theKing's Men, but casting is uncertain.John Lowinmay have performed the title role, as he is associated with the role in James Wright'sHistoria Histrionica(1699).William Giffordhypothesized thatAlexander Cookemay have played Lady Would-be. Either that summer or the next, an outbreak ofplagueclosed the London theatres, and the company performed the play at Oxford and Cambridge. Jonson may have added the first act's satire onPythagorasfor these audiences. The play certainly remained in the King's Men's repertoire throughout the period. It was performed forCharlesin 1624 while he was stillPrince of Wales, in 1630, and again at theCockpit-in-Courtin 1637.

After theRestoration, the play enjoyed a lengthy prominence:John Genestrecords over fifty performances before 1770. John Evelyn saw it performed at the court of Charles II on 16 October 1662. When the theatres reopened, the play was owned by the King's Men ofThomas Killigrew; it was performed atDrury Lanein 1663.Michael Mohunplayed Volpone toHart'sMosca;Katherine Coreyplayed Celia, andRebecca Marshallplayed Lady Would-be. The same cast was seen bySamuel Pepysin 1665.

The play continued in performance throughout the 18th century.Richard Steelementions a performance in a 1709 edition ofTatler. Famous eighteenth-century Volpones includedJames Quin; famous Moscas includedCharles Macklin.Colley Cibberplayed Corvino in his productions; his wife Katherine Shore played Celia, as later didElizabeth Inchbald. As with many other Jacobean plays, Volpone had lost its appeal before the end of the 18th century. Earlier in the century, critics had complained about the improbability of the fifth act, frequently likened to farce, and to Jonson's highly Latinate language. An updated version byGeorge Colman the Elderfailed at Drury Lane in 1771. By the end of the century, the objections appeared insurmountable to producers, and the play fell into disuse.

The play was revived by the Phoenix Society at theLyric Hammersmithin 1921;W. B. Yeatswas in the audience and mentions the production approvingly in a letter toAllan Wade. TheBirmingham Repertory Theatrestaged the play at theMalvernFestival in 1935.

A 1938 production introduced two of the dominant elements of twentieth-century productions: the performance ofDonald Wolfitand animal imagery. Wolfit's dynamic performance in the title role, repeated several times over the next decades, set the standard for modern interpretations of Volpone: Politick's plot was truncated or eliminated, and Mosca (played in 1938 byAlan Wheatley) relegated to a secondary role.

The play has since been staged by a number of famous companies. In 1952,George DevinedirectedAnthony Quayle(Mosca) andRalph Richardson(Volpone) at theStratford Memorial Theatre. At the same theatre in 1955,Eric Porterplayed Volpone. In 1968, SirTyrone Guthrie'sNational Theatreproduction emphasized the beast-fable motif; this production featured stage design byTanya Moiseiwitsch. In the same year, David Raeburn directed a modern dress performance featuring rock music settings of the songs at Beckenham Boys Grammar.

In 1972, the play was staged at theBristol Old Vic. A most memorable production of the 1970s wasPeter Hall's staging for theRoyal National Theatrein 1974, withPaul Scofieldas Volpone,Ben Kingsleyas Mosca, SirJohn Gielgudas Sir Politick, andIan Charlesonas Peregrine. In 1971, theStratford Festivalmounted a Canadian production directed byDavid William, withWilliam Huttin the title role andDouglas Rainas Mosca.[1]

Matthew Warchusreceived anOlivier Awardnomination for his 1995 production at the Royal National Theatre; it featuredMichael GambonandSimon Russell Beale.

Volponewas adapted byJules RomainsandStefan Zweigin their 1928 production, with the ending changed so that Mosca ends up with Volpone's money. This version was used byGeorge Antheilin his 1953operaVolpone.

In 1941 a French film version was released, under the direction of noted filmmakerMaurice Tourneur. Begun in 1938 byJacques de Baroncelli, the production shut down because of financial difficulties. Tourneur took over and the shooting resumed in 1940. This version also used portions of the adaptation by Romains and Zweig.

An adaptation byAlphons Silbermannran at theIndependent Theatre, Sydney from 3 April to 21 June 1947.[2]

A short-lived 1964Broadwaymusical adaptation entitledFoxymoved the play's setting to theYukonduring thegold rushof 1898.

It wasadapted for Australian television in 1968.

The stage adaptationSly Fox, byLarry Gelbart, updated the setting fromRenaissanceVeniceto 19th centurySan Francisco, and changed the tone from satire to farce.

The Honey Potis a 1967 film byJoseph L. Mankiewiczbased onVolpone, although with a romantic subplot and sentimental trappings. It featuredRex Harrisonin the main role,Cliff Robertsonas Mosca (""McFly""), andMaggie Smithas the love interest. A portion of the original play is presented in private performance for Harrison's character, who states that it is his favourite.

In France, there have been three further video and DVD adaptations ofVolponebased on versions of the Stefan Zweig/Jules Romains script: in 1978,Jean Meyerdirected a production in the 'théâtre de boulevard' style for the Théâtre de Marigny and Panorama (Au Théâtre ce soir), starring himself as Corbaccio,Jean Le Poulainas Volpone,Francis Husteras Mosca andClaude Jadeas Colomba (Celia). This was followed in 2001 by a production directed byFrancis Perrinwith a script that resembles the Zweig/Romains text but rewritten in pseudo-Elizabethan style by Jean Collette and Toni Cecchinato. Bernard Haller plays the part of Volpone, Francis Perrin plays Mosca, and Thibaut Lorain plays Lady Would-Be. In 2003, the play was rewritten for television byÉric-Emmanuel Schmittfor a production starringGérard Depardieuas Volpone andDaniel Prévostas Mosca. The ending is changed to see Volpone and Mosca escaping together with Corbaccio's wife.

In 1974György Fehéradapted the play for theHungarian Televisionwith titleVolpone. Volpone was played byTamás Major.

In 1988 the film was adapted for Italian cinema byMaurizio Ponzi, with the titleIl volpone. Set in modernLiguria, it featuresPaolo Villaggioas Ugo Maria Volpone andEnrico Montesanoas Bartolomeo Mosca.

On 24 March 2004,Ian McDiarmidstarred as Volpone in aBBC Radio 3production directed by Peter Kavanagh that includedTom Hollanderas Mosca, Malcolm Sinclair as Corvino, Patrick Barlow as Voltore andJohn Roweas Corbacchio.

In 2004 theWolf Trap Opera Company,Vienna, Virginia, commissioned and produced a new opera based on the play. The score was written byJohn Mustowith libretto by Mark Campbell. The world premiere took place atThe Barns at Wolf Trapon 10 March 2004. The opera was produced again in 2007 by the Wolf Trap Opera Company with a new cast featuring Joshua Jeremiah, Jeremy Little, Faith Sherman, andLisa Hopkins. This production was recorded live at The Barns at Wolf Trap for Wolf Trap Recordings and wasnominated in 2010for aGrammy Award for Best Opera Recording."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45524,The Open Boat and Other Stories,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Boat,"""The Open Boat"" focuses on four characters:the correspondent(based upon Crane himself), a condescending observer detached from the rest of the group;[15]the captain, who is injured and morose at having lost his ship, yet capable of leadership;the cook, fat and comical, but optimistic that they will be rescued; andthe oiler, Billie, who is physically the strongest, and the only one in the story referred to by name. The four are survivors of a shipwreck, which occurred before the beginning of the story, and are drifting at sea in a small dinghy.

The story is divided into seven sections and is told mainly from the correspondent'spoint of view. The first section introduces the four men, whose moods fluctuate over the next four sections from anger at their desperate situation, to a growing empathy for one another and the sudden realization that nature is indifferent to their fates. The men become fatigued and bicker with one another; nevertheless, the oiler and the correspondent take turns rowing toward shore, while the cook bails water to keep the boat afloat. When they see alighthouseon the horizon, their hope is tempered with the realization of the danger of trying to reach it. Their hopes dwindle further when, after seeing a man waving from shore, and what may or may not be another boat, they fail to make contact. The correspondent and the oiler continue to take turns rowing, while the others sleep fitfully during the night. The correspondent then notices a shark swimming near the boat, but he does not seem to be bothered by it as one would expect. In the sixth section, the correspondent wearily recalls a verse from the poem ""Bingen on the Rhine"" byCaroline Norton, in which a ""soldier of the Legion"" dies far from home.

The final section begins with the men's resolution to abandon the slowly sinking boat they have occupied for thirty hours and to swim ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able to swim on. After three of the men safely reach the shore and are met by a group of rescuers, they find Billie dead, his body washed up on the beach.

Although autobiographical in nature, ""The Open Boat"" is a work of fiction; it is often considered a principal example ofNaturalism, an offshoot of theRealistliterary movement, in which scientific principles of objectivity and detachment are applied to the study of human characteristics. While a majority of critics agree that the story acts as aparadigmof the human situation, they disagree as to its precise nature.[16]Some believe the story affirms man's place in the world by concentrating on the characters' isolation,[17]while others—including those who call ""The Open Boat"" ideologicallySymbolist—insist that the story questions man's place in the universe through metaphorical or indirect means.[18]

Like other major works by Stephen Crane, ""The Open Boat"" contains numerous examples of symbolism,imageryandmetaphor. Vibrant descriptions of color, combined with simple, clear writing, are also apparent throughout, and humor in the form of irony serves in stark opposition to the dreary setting and desperate characters.[19]EditorVincent Starrettstated in his introduction to the 1921 collection of Crane's work entitledMen, Women and Boatsthat the author keeps ""down the tone where another writer might have attempted 'fine writing' and have been lost.""[20]Other critics have noted similarities between the story and shipwreck-related articles Crane wrote while working as a reporter for theNew York Tribuneearlier in his career. Articles such as ""The Wreck of theNew Era"", which describes a group of castaways drowning in sight of a helpless crowd, and ""Ghosts on the Jersey Coast"" contain stark imagery that strongly prefigures that of ""The Open Boat"".[21]

Similar to other Naturalist works, ""The Open Boat"" scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. The struggle between man and the natural world is the most apparent theme in the work,[15]and while the characters at first believe the turbulent sea to be a hostile force set against them, they come to believe that nature is instead ambivalent. At the beginning of the last section, the correspondent rethinks his view of nature's hostility: ""the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual—nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to him, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent.""[22]The correspondent regularly refers to the sea with feminine pronouns, pitting the four men in the boat against an intangible, yet effeminate, threat; critic Leedice Kissane further pointed to the story's seeming denigration of women, noting the castaways' personification of Fate as ""an old ninny-woman"" and ""an old hen"".[23]That nature is ultimately disinterested is an idea that appears in other works by Crane; a poem from Crane's 1899 collectionWar is Kind and Other Linesalso echoes Crane's common theme of universal indifference:[24]

Themetaphysicalconflicts born from man's isolation are also important themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection.[26]The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, as well as his inability to blame God for his misfortunes,[27]musing: ""When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply that there are no bricks and no temples.""[28]Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things ""seemed"" or ""appeared"", leaving how a thing actually ""was"" entirely ambiguous.[29]Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—""None of them knew the color of the sky""—as one that sets the scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.[30]

Chester Wolford noted in his critical analysis of Crane's short fiction that although one of the author's most familiar themes deals with a character's seeming insignificance in an indifferent universe, the correspondent's experience in ""The Open Boat"" is perhaps more personal than what was described in earlier stories because of Crane's obvious connection to the story.[31]Sergio Perosa similarly described how Crane ""transfigures an actual occurrence into existential drama, and confers universal meaning and poetic value on the simple retelling of man's struggle for survival"".[32]

Facing an ultimately detached nature, the characters find solace in human solidarity.[33]They are often referred to collectively as ""the men"", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness.[34]The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: ""It would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common.""[35]Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: ""If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?""[36]By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.[34]

In his 1990 bookSea-Brothers: The Tradition of American Sea Fiction from Moby-Dick to the Present, author Bert Bender noted Crane's sympathetic portrayal of the oiler Billie, the most physically able of the four characters, and yet the only one to perish. The correspondent even notes with wonder Billie's exceptional ability to row despite having worked a double shift before the ship sank.[37]Bender wrote that Crane ""emphasizes that Billie's steady, simple labor is the tangible basis for his role here as a savior,"" and that the oiler's portrayal as a ""simple, working seaman, clearly expresses his sympathy with the democratic ideal of the sailor before the mast that figures so crucially in the tradition of American sea fiction.""[38]That Billie does not survive the ordeal, however, can be seen as an antithesis toDarwinismin that the only person to not survive was in fact the strongest physically.[39]

""The Open Boat"" directly referencesLady Caroline Norton's 1883 poem ""Bingen on the Rhine"", which focuses on the death of aFrench Foreign Legionnaire, far from home, while grasping the hand of a comrade. Recalling the poem, the correspondent sees how the soldier's dire circumstances mirror his own, leading him to feel sorry for the anonymous poetic figure; noting the similarities between the dying soldier and the shipwrecked correspondent, critics such as Edward Stone and Max Westbrook believe this realization causes the correspondent to discover the necessity for human sympathy in an uncaring world.[41]While the literary reference may be considered ironic, unsympathetic, and only of minor interest, Stone for one argued that this poem may also have served as a source forThe Red Badge of Courage, which also explores man's relationship with the metaphysical.[42]

""The Open Boat"" is one of the most frequently discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized.Wilson Follettincluded the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volumeStephen Crane: An Omnibus.[43]The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalistHarold Fredericwrote in his review forThe New York Timesthat ""even if he had written nothing else, [""The Open Boat"" would] have placed [Crane] where he now undoubtedly stands.""[44]English poetRobert Bridgeslikewise praised the story in his review forLife, stating that Crane ""has indelibly fixed the experience on your mind, and that is the test of a literary artisan"".[45]American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New YorkEvening Sunthat ""those who have read 'The Open Boat' will forget every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the egg-shell changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group"".[46]

After Crane's premature death fromtuberculosisat the age of 28, his work enjoyed a resurgence of popularity. Author and criticElbert Hubbardwrote in Crane's obituary in thePhilistinethat ""The Open Boat"" was ""the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned"".[47]Also noting the depressing Realism utilized in the story, editor Vincent Starrett stated: ""It is a desolate picture, and the tale is one of our greatest short stories.""[20]Another of the author's friends,H. G. Wells, wrote that ""The Open Boat"" was ""beyond all question, the crown of all [Crane's] work.""[1]Singling out Crane's usage of color andchiaroscuroin his writing, Wells continued: ""It has all the stark power of the earlier stories, with a new element of restraint; the color is as full and strong as ever, fuller and stronger, indeed; but those chromatic splashes that at times deafen and confuse inThe Red Badge, those images that astonish rather than enlighten, are disciplined and controlled.""[1]The story remains popular with critics; Thomas Kent referred to ""The Open Boat"" as Crane's ""magnum opus"",[48]while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it ""Crane's finest short story and one of the masterworks of late nineteenth-century American literature"".[15]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/233,Sister Carrie: A Novel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Carrie,"In late 1889, dissatisfied with life inColumbia County, Wisconsin, 18-year-old Caroline Meeber, ""Sister Carrie"" to her family, takes the train to Chicago to live with her older sister Minnie and Minnie's husband. On the train, Carrie meets Charles Drouet, a traveling salesman who is attracted to her because of her simple beauty and unspoiled manner. They exchange contact information, but upon discovering the ""steady round of toil"" and somber atmosphere at her sister's flat, she writes to Drouet and discourages him from calling on her there.

Carrie soon finds a job running a machine in a shoe factory and gives most of her meager salary to the Hansons for room and board. One day, after an illness costs her job, she encounters Drouet. He persuades her to leave this dull, constricted life and move in with him. To press his case, he slips Carrie two $10 bills, opening a vista of material possibilities to her. The next day, he rebuffs her feeble attempt to return the money and retain her virtue, taking her shopping at a Chicago department store and buying her a jacket and some shoes. That night, she moves in with him.

Drouet installs her in a much nicer apartment. She gradually sheds her provincial mannerisms. By the time he introduces her to George Hurstwood, the manager of Fitzgerald and Moy's – a respectable bar that Drouet describes as a ""way-up, swell place"" – her material appearance has improved considerably. Hurstwood, a married man with a social-climbing wife, a 20-year-old son, and a 17-year-old daughter, becomes infatuated with Carrie, and they start an affair, meeting secretly while Drouet is on a business trip.

One night, Drouet casually agrees to find an actress to play Laura in an amateur theatrical presentation ofAugustin Daly's melodramaUnder the Gaslightfor his local chapter of theElks. He encourages a hesitant Carrie to take the part. Carrie turns out to have acting talent, and her ambition is born. Initially, she falls victim tostage fright, but Drouet's encouragement between acts enables her to give a fine performance that rivets the audience's attention and inflames Hurstwood's passion. He then decides to take Carrie away from Drouet.

The next day, Drouet finds out about the affair, and Hurstwood's wife Julia learns that Hurstwood has been seen with another woman. Hurstwood makes advances, and when Carrie asks if he will marry her, he says yes. Later, Drouet confronts Carrie and informs her that Hurstwood is married, then walks out on her. After a night of drinking, and despairing at his now-emboldened wife's demands and Carrie's rejection letter, Hurstwood finds that the safe in Fitzgerald and Moy's offices has accidentally been left unlocked. When he inadvertently locks the safe after taking the money out, he drunkenly panics and steals the day's proceeds — more than $10,000. Under the false pretext of Drouet's sudden illness, he lures Carrie onto a train and takes her to Canada. In Montreal, Hurstwood is found by a private investigator; he returns most of the stolen funds to avoid prosecution. Hurstwood mollifies Carrie by arranging a marriage ceremony (but he still is married to Julia), and the couple move to New York City.

They rent a flat, where they live as George and Carrie Wheeler. Hurstwood buys a minority interest in a saloon, and initially he can provide Carrie with an adequate, if not lavish, lifestyle. The couple grow distant, however, as their finances do not improve. Carrie's dissatisfaction only increases when she makes friends with Mrs. Vance, a neighbor whose husband is prosperous. Through Mrs. Vance, Carrie meets Robert Ames, a young scholar fromIndianaand her neighbor's cousin, who introduces her to the idea that great art, rather than showy materialism, is worthy of admiration.

After only a few years, the saloon's landlord sells the property, and Hurstwood's business partner decides to terminate the partnership. Too proud to accept any of the limited job opportunities available to him, Hurstwood watches his savings dwindle. He urges Carrie to economize, which she finds humiliating and distasteful. As Hurstwood sinks into apathy, Carrie becomes achorus girlthrough her good looks. While he deteriorates, she rises from the chorus line to small roles. Her performance as a minor, non-speaking character, a frowningQuakeress, greatly amuses the audience and makes the play a hit. She is befriended by Lola Osborne, another chorus girl, who urges Carrie to become her roommate. In a final attempt to earn money, Hurstwood becomes ascab, driving a Brooklynstreetcarduring a streetcar operator's strike. His ill-fated venture lasts only two days, ending after a couple of violent encounters with the strikers. Carrie, unaware of Hurstwood's reason for quitting, leaves him.

Hurstwood ultimately becomes one of the homeless of New York, taking odd jobs, falling ill withpneumonia, and finally becoming a beggar. He ultimately commits suicide in aflophouse. Carrie achieves stardom, but finds that, even with fame and fortune, she is lonely and unhappy.

At the urging of his journalist friend Arthur Henry, Dreiser began writing his manuscript in 1899. He frequently gave up on it but Henry urged him to continue. From the outset, his title wasSister Carrie, but he changed it toThe Flesh and the Spiritwhile writing it; he restored the original name once complete.[4]

Dreiser had difficulty finding a publisher forSister Carrie.Doubleday & McClure Companyaccepted the manuscript, but the wife of one of the publishers declared it to be too sordid.[5]Dreiser insisted on publication, and Doubleday & McClure were legally bound to honor their contract; 1,008 copies were printed on November 8, 1900, but the publisher made no effort to advertise the book and only 456 copies were sold.[6]However,Frank Norris, who was working as a reader at Doubleday, sent a few copies to literary reviewers.[7]

From 1900 to 1980, all editions of the novel were of a second altered version. Dreiser's unaltered version was not published until 1981, when theUniversity of Pennsylvania Pressissued a scholarly edition based upon the original manuscript held by theNew York Public Library. It is a reconstruction by a team of leading scholars to represent the novel before it was edited by people other than Dreiser.[8]

In hisNobel PrizeLecture of 1930,Sinclair Lewissaid that ""Dreiser's great first novel,Sister Carrie, which he dared to publish thirty long years ago and which I read twenty-five years ago, came to housebound and airless America like a great free Western wind, and to our stuffy domesticity gave us the first fresh air sinceMark TwainandWhitman.""[9]

In 1998, theModern LibraryrankedSister Carrie33rd on its list of the100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

Theodore Dreiser is considered one of America's greatnaturalists, significant because he wrote at the early stages of the naturalist movement.Sister Carriewas a movement away from the emphasis onmorals of the Victorian eraand focused more onrealismand the base instincts of humans.[10]

Sister Carriewent against social and moral norms of the time as Dreiser presented his characters without judging them. Dreiser fought against censorship ofSister Carrie, brought about because Carrie engaged in affairs and other ""illicit sexual relationships"" without suffering any consequences. This flouted prevailing norms, that a character who practiced such sinful behavior must be punished in the course of the plot in order to be taught a lesson.[10]

Dreiser sometimes has been criticized for his writing style. In 1930,Arnold Bennettstated ""Dreiser simply does not know how to write, never did know, never wanted to know."" Other critics called his style ""vulgar"", ""uneven"", ""clumsy"", ""awkward"", and ""careless"". His plots were decried as unimaginative, with critics citing his lack of education and claiming that he lacked intellectualism.[11]

However,Alfred Kazin—while criticizing Dreiser's style—pointed out that Dreiser's novels had survived and remained influential works. Michael Lydon, in defense of Dreiser, claims that his patience and powers of observation created accurate depictions of the urban world and the desires and ambitions of the people of the time. Lydon stated that Dreiser's intent was to focus on the message ofSister Carrie, not on its writing style.[11]

Theodore Dreiser'sSister Carriewas not widely accepted after it was published, but it was not completely withdrawn by its publishers as some sources say it was. Neither was it received with the harshness that Dreiser reported. For example, theToledo Bladereported that the book ""is a faithful portraiture of the conditions it represents, showing how the tangle of human life is knotted thread by thread"" but that it was ""too realistic, too somber to be altogether pleasing"".[12]There is also the receipt of sale which Doubleday sent to Dreiser showing thatSister Carriewas not withdrawn from the shelves, reporting that 456 copies of the 1,008 copies printed were sold.[12]

Sister Carrieevoked different responses from the critics, and although the book did not sell well among the general public, it often received positive reviews.[13]Some of the reason for lack of sales came from a conflict between Dreiser and his publishers, who did little to promote the book.[13]However, critics did praise the book, and a large number seemed most affected by the character of Hurstwood, such as the critic writing for theNew Haven Journal Courier, who wrote ""One of the most affecting passages is where Hurstwood falls, ruined, disgraced.""[14]Edna Kentonin theChicago Daily Newswrote in 1900 thatSister Carrieis ""well worth reading simply for this account of Hurstwood"".[14]

Reviews mentioned the novel's realistic depiction of the human condition. A 1901 review inThe Academywrote thatSister Carriewas ""absolutely free from the slightest trace of sentimentality or pettiness, and dominated everywhere by a serious and strenuous desire for truth.""[14]The London Expressclaimed that realism made the book appealing: ""It is a cruel, merciless story, intensely clever in its realism, and one that will remain impressed in the memory of the reader for many a long day.""[14]The novel has been praised for its accurate depiction of the protests in New York and the city life in Chicago.[14]

Negative response to the novel came largely from the book's sexual content, which madeSister Carrie, in the words of theOmaha Daily Beein 1900, ""not a book to be put into the hands of every reader indiscriminately.""[14]Another review inLifecriticized Carrie's success and warned ""Such girls, however, as imagine that they can follow in her footsteps will probably end their days on the Island or in the gutter.""[14]The book also was criticized for never mentioning the name of God.[14]

Several critics complained the title made the book sound as if the main character is a nun.[14]The title of the book was considered byThe Newark Sunday Newsto be the ""weakest thing about the book"" because it ""does not bear the faintest relation to the story.""[14]Similarly,Frederic Taber CooperinThe Bookmandeclared it to be a ""colourless and misleading title"". Other common complaints were about the length of the book and that it is so depressing that it is unpleasant to read.[14]

While some viewed his work as grammatically and syntactically inaccurate, others found his detailed storytelling intriguing.[15]H. L. Mencken, an avid supporter and friend, referred to Dreiser as ""a man of large originality, of profound feeling, and of unshakable courage"".[10]Mencken believed that Dreiser's raw, honest portrayal of Carrie's life should be seen as a courageous attempt to give the reader a realistic view of the life of women in the 19th century.[16]

In opposition, one critic, Karl F. Zender, argued that Dreiser's stress on circumstance over character was ""adequate neither to the artistic power nor to the culture implications of Sister Carrie"".[16]Many found Dreiser's work attractive due to his lenient ""moralistic judgments"" and the ""spacious compassion"" in which he viewed his characters' actions.[15]This tolerance of immorality was an entirely new idea for the readers of Dreiser's era. In fact, the novel and its modern ideas of morality helped to produce a movement in which the literary generation of its time was found ""detaching itself from its predecessor"".[17]There remained some who disapproved of Dreiser's immoral, atypical story. David E.E. Sloan argued that Dreiser's novel undermined the general opinion that hard work and virtue bring success in life.[18]

Although Dreiser has been criticized for his writing style and lack of formal education,Sister Carrieremains an influential example of naturalism and realism. While it initially did not sell well (fewer than 500 copies) and encountered censorship, it now is considered one of the great Americanurban novels, which explores the gritty details of human nature and the effect ofindustrializationon the American people.[10]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40426,Daddy-Long-Legs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy-Long-Legs_(novel),"Jerusha ""Judy"" Abbott was brought up at the John Grier Home, an old-fashionedorphanage. The children were completely dependent oncharityand had to wear other people's cast-off clothes. Jerusha's unusual first name was selected by the matron from a gravestone (she hates it and uses ""Judy"" instead), while her surname was selected out of the phone book.

One day, after the asylum's trustees have made their monthly visit, Judy is informed by the asylum's dour matron that one of the trustees has offered to pay her way through college. He has spoken to her former teachers and thinks she has potential to become an excellent writer. He will pay her tuition and give her a generous monthly allowance. Judy must write him a monthly letter because he believes that letter-writing is important to the development of a writer. However, she will never know his identity; she must address the letters to Mr. John Smith, and he never will reply.

Judy catches a glimpse of the shadow of her benefactor from the back, and knows he is a tall long-legged man. Because of this, she jokingly calls himDaddy-Long-Legs. She attends a women’s college on theEast Coast of the United States. She illustrates her letters with childlike line drawings, also created by Jean Webster.

The book chronicles Judy's educational, personal, and social growth. One of the first things she does at college is to change her name to Judy. She designs a rigorous reading program for herself and struggles to gain the basic cultural knowledge to which she, growing up in the bleak environment of the orphanage, never was exposed.

During her stay, she befriends Sallie McBride (the most entertaining person in the world) and Julia Rutledge Pendleton (the least so) and sups with them and Leonora Fenton.

Afterwards, Judy graduates from college and is pursuing her dream to become a writer. However, Julia's uncle Jervis proposes to Judy and she refuses because someone like her wouldn't be good enough to marry a Pendleton. After this, Jervis catches a deadly illness during his travel at Canada. Meanwhile, Judy is excited to be invited to meet Daddy Long-Legs in New York City. When she arrives, she discovers that Jervis is Daddy Long-Legs. She reconsiders the proposal and accepts Jervis to be her husband.

The book is dedicated ""To You."" Today this book is often classified aschildren's literature, but at the time it was part of a trend of ""girl"" or ""college girl"" books which featured young female protagonists dealing with post-high-school concerns such as college, career, and marriage. These books predated the contemporary view of adolescence. Other authors who wrote in this vein includeL. M. MontgomeryandLouisa May Alcott. InGeorgina Castle Smith's children's novelNothing to Nobody(1873), Daddy Long Legs[sic]is the name of the orphaned urchin who receives the assistance.[3]

Daddy-Long-Legsstill receives good reviews.[4]Reviewers comment on its relatability to a wide variety of audiences and unique nature in comparison to other modern books' – it isn't filled with action or melodrama, but rather just regular life. Reviewers also note that people tend to be attracted to orphans and orphanages, especially now that they have been mythologized in fiction such asLittle Orphan Annie. Judy's being an orphan makes her sympathetic and allows for more room for her to learn and grow while in college, reviewers note.[4]

This book was Webster's best-known work. Webster herself adapted it into astage playthat debuted in 1914. In addition, it was adapted into a 1952 British stage musical comedy calledLove from Judy,[5]as well as films in1919(starringMary Pickford),1931(starringJanet GaynorandWarner Baxter), 1935 (aShirley Templeadaptation calledCurly Top), a 1938DutchadaptationVadertje Langbeenand a 1955 film,Daddy Long Legs(starringFred AstaireandLeslie Caron). The latter two film versions departed considerably from the plot of the original novel.[6]

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58866,The Murder on the Links,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murder_on_the_Links,"Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings travel toMerlinville-sur-Mer,France, to meet Paul Renauld, who has requested their help. When they arrive, local police greet them with the news that Renauld was found dead that morning, stabbed in the back with a knife and left in a newly dug grave adjacent to a localgolf course. His wife, Eloise Renauld, claims masked men broke into the villa at 2am, tied her up, and took her husband away with them. Upon inspecting his body, Eloise collapses with grief at seeing her dead husband. Monsieur Giraud of the Sûreté leads the police investigation, and resents Poirot's involvement.

Poirot notes four key facts about the case: a piece of lead piping is found near the body; only three female servants were in the villa as both Renauld's son Jack and his chauffeur had been sent away; an unknown person visited the day before; and Renauld's immediate neighbour, Madame Daubreuil, had placed 200,000francsinto her bank account over recent weeks.

When Renauld's secretary, Gabriel Stonor, returns from England, he suggests blackmail, as his employer's past is a complete mystery prior to his career in South America. Meanwhile, Hastings unexpectedly encounters a young woman he had met on the train, known only as ""Cinderella."" She asks to see the crime scene and then disappears with the murder weapon.

Poirot discovers that the case is nearly identical to one from 22 years ago, in which a man called Georges Conneau and his lover, Madame Beroldy, conspired to kill Madame Beroldy's husband. Poirot travels to Paris to discover more about the Conneau murder. He finds a photograph of Madame Beroldy that shows that she is really Madame Daubreuil. On returning, Poirot learns that the body of a tramp has been found, stabbed through the heart with the murder weapon. An examination shows that he died before Renauld's murder from anepileptic seizureand was stabbed later.

Giraud arrests Jack on the basis that he wanted his father's money. Poirot reveals Renauld changed his will two weeks before his murder, disinheriting Jack. Jack is released from prison after Bella Duveen, an English stage performer he loves, confesses to the murder. Both had come across the body on the night of the murder, and each assumed the other had killed Renauld. Poirot reveals neither did, as the real killer was Marthe Daubreuil, daughter of the neighbor.

Poirot elaborates on his theory: Paul Renauld was really Georges Conneau, who returned to France after fleeing years ago. By misfortune, he found that his immediate neighbour would be Madame Beroldy, his old lover; like him, she had changed her identity, becoming Mme. Daubreuil. Blackmailed by her over his past, Renauld found his situation worsened when Jack becomes attracted to her daughter. When a tramp died on his grounds, he saw an opportunity to stage his own death and escape Mme Daubreuil. He would disfigure the tramp's face with the pipe, and then bury the tramp and the pipe beside the golf course, before fleeing the area by train. Anyone who would recognise that the body was not his would be sent away. However, the plan was discovered by Marthe, who followed Renauld and stabbed him after he dug the grave for the tramp's body. Her motive is money; Jack will inherit his father's fortune on his mother's death. To expose Marthe as the killer, Poirot asked Eloise to openly state she will disinherit Jack. Marthe attempts to kill Eloise in her villa but dies in a struggle with Hastings's Cinderella.

Marthe's mother disappears again. Jack and his mother plan to go to South America, joined by Hastings and his Cinderella, who is revealed as Bella Duveen's twin sister Dulcie.

The Times Literary Supplementreviewed the novel in its issue of 7 June 1923. The review compared the methods of detection of Poirot toSherlock Holmesand concluded favourably that the book ""provides the reader with an enthralling mystery of an unusual kind"".[5]

The New York Times Book Reviewof 25 March 1923 began, ""Here is a remarkably good detective story which can be warmly commended to those who like that kind of fiction."" After detailing the set-up of the story the review continued, ""The plot has peculiar complications and the reader will have to be very astute indeed if he guesses who the criminal is until the last complexity has been unravelled. The author is notably ingenious in the construction and unravelling of the mystery, which develops fresh interests and new entanglements at every turn. She deserves commendation also for the care with which the story is worked out and the good craftsmanship with which it is written. Although there is not much endeavour to portray character, except in the case of M. Poirot, several of the personages are depicted with swiftly made expressive and distinctive lines.""[6]

The unnamed reviewer inThe Observerof 10 June 1923 said, ""WhenConan DoylepopularisedSherlock Holmesin theStrandof the 'nineties he lit such a candle as the publishers will not willingly let out. Not a week passes which does not bring a 'detective' story from one quarter or another, and several of the popular magazines rely mainly on that commodity. Among the later cultivators of this anything but lonely furrow the name of Agatha Christie is well in the front. If she has not the touch of artistry which madeThe Speckled BandandThe Hound of the Baskervillesthings of real horror, she has an unusual gift of mechanical complication."" The reviewer went on to compare the novel withThe Mysterious Affair at Styles, which they called ""a remarkable piece of work"", but warned that ""it is a mistake to carry the art of bewilderment to the point of making the brain reel"". They did admit that ""[n]o solution could be more surprising"" and stated that the character of Poirot was ""a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him.""[7]

Robert Barnard: ""Super-complicated early whodunit, set in the northerly fringes of France so beloved of the English bankrupt. Poirot pits his wits against a sneering sophisticate of a French policeman while Hastings lets his wander after an auburn-haired female acrobat. Entertaining for most of its length, but the solution is one of those 'once revealed, instantly forgotten' ones, where ingenuity has triumphed over common sense"".[8]

In a modern work of literary criticism, Christie biographer Laura Thompson writes:

She notes as well that the book, the second novel featuring Poirot, is notable for a subplot in which Hastings falls in love, a development ""greatly desired on Agatha's part... parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine.""[4]

The novel received its first true publication as a four-part serialisation in theGrand Magazinefrom December 1922 to March 1923 (Issues 214–217) under the title of ""The Girl with the Anxious Eyes"" before it was issued in book form by The Bodley Head in May 1923.[9]This was Christie's first published work for theGrand Magazinewhich went on to publish many of her short stories throughout the 1920s.

Christie'sAutobiographyrecounts how she objected to the illustration of thedustjacketof the UK first edition stating that it was both badly drawn and unrepresentative of the plot.[10]It was the first of many such objections she raised with her publishers over the dustjacket. It would appear that Christie won her argument over the dustjacket as the one she describes and objected to (""a man in his pyjamas, dying of an epileptic fit on a golf course"") does not resemble the actual jacket which shows Monsieur Renauld digging the open grave on the golf course at night.

Christie dedicated her third book as follows:

Christie refers here to her first husband,Archibald Christie(1890–1962) from whom she was divorced in 1928.

The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially writtenblurb. Instead it carried quotes of reviews forThe Mysterious Affair at Styleswhilst the back jacket flap carried similar quotes forThe Secret Adversary.

The Murder on the Linkswas adapted for the stage by American playwrightSteven Dietzin 2021. Performed by an ensemble cast of six, with Poirot and Hastings played by either male or female actors, this serio-comic adaptation is scheduled to premiere in San Diego (North Coast Repertory Theatre) and at the Laguna Playhouse in 2023.[11]

An adaptation of the novel was made for the seriesAgatha Christie's Poiroton 11 February 1996. It was produced byCarnival Films, and starredDavid Suchetas Hercule Poirot, andHugh Fraseras Arthur Hastings. While much of the novel's plot was retained, the adaptation featured a number of changes, which included the setting being changed toDeauville, France, where filming took place on-site.[13][14][15]The wager between Poirot and  Giraud is changed; instead of 500 Francs,[16]the stakes are Giraud's famous pipe against Poirot's mustache. In the end, Poirot returns the pipe, observing that Giraud will think of him whenever he uses it. Jack is Paul's stepson who was adopted by him and took his last name, instead of being his biological son. The denouement is different. Bella is a singer, who introduces herself to Hastings as “Isabelle”. She still confuses things by confessing to the crime, but she no longer loves Jack. It is Stonor who shoots Marthe with her own gun when—as Poirot predicts—she breaks in and tries to kill Madame Renaud. Marthe's mother does not escape, but is arrested. There is no twin sister. Bella is now in love with Hastings, who is staying in Deauville to make sense of it all.  Poirot brings her to the promenade on the seaside, where they share a long kiss. Fade out.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22964,Sense and Sensibility,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility,"On his deathbed, Henry Dashwood gets John, his son by his first wife, to promise to take care of his stepmother and half-sisters,Elinor,Marianneand Margaret, from his inheritance. But Fanny, John's wife, persuades her husband not to support them financially, leaving them to survive on a greatly reduced income.

Fanny’s brotherEdward Ferrarscomes on a visit, but when Elinor and he seem to be growing close, Fanny warns Mrs Dashwood that Edward is destined for higher things by their mother. Affronted by this, Mrs Dashwood decides to move her family to Barton Cottage inDevonshire, which has been offered her at a low rent by her second cousin, Sir John Middleton. Later, while dining with the Middletons at Barton Park, Marianne attracts the attention of a family friend, Colonel Brandon. However, he is aged thirty-five, which seems much too old to the romantic sensibility of sixteen-year-old Marianne.

Marianne sprains her ankle out walking, but is carried home by John Willoughby, who sees her fall. During subsequent visits their similar artistic tastes cause the girl to fall in love with him, abandoning caution and propriety. Just as an engagement seems imminent, however, Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his elderly cousin Mrs. Smith, upon whom he is financially dependent due to his debts, is sending him toLondonindefinitely on business, leaving Marianne distraught.

When Edward Ferrars pays a visit to Barton Cottage, he seems subdued. Shortly afterwards, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Sir John’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, come to stay at Barton Park. While there, Lucy forces on Elinor the secret of her prior engagement to Edward, giving Elinor an insight into Lucy's jealous and calculating nature.

Mrs Jennings invites the elder Dashwood sisters on a visit to London. After Marianne’s letters to Willoughby go unanswered, they meet later at a dance. Willoughby is with another woman and greets Marianne coldly, later informing her of his engagement to the rich Miss Grey. Marianne is very upset but admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby never were actually engaged.

Colonel Brandon now reveals to Elinor that Willoughby had earlier seduced and abandoned Brandon's teenaged ward, Eliza Williams. Willoughby's cousin has consequently disinherited him, which explains his need to marry an heiress. Meanwhile, the Steele sisters come to London and are invited to stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house in preference to Elinor and Marianne. On account of their cordiality, Anne believes that the Ferrars have become fond enough of Lucy to welcome her into the family and betrays to them Lucy's engagement to Edward. As a result, the sisters are dismissed from the house, and Edward is ordered by his wealthy mother to break off the engagement. When Edward refuses, he is disinherited in favour of his younger brother. On learning this, Colonel Brandon shows his admiration for Edward’s honourable conduct by offering him the clerical living of a nearby parsonage, so as to enable him to marry Lucy after he is ordained.

Mrs. Jennings now takes the Dashwood sisters to visit her second daughter as they make their way back to Devonshire. Marianne goes walking in the rain and her life is endangered by contractingputrid fever. When Elinor writes home, Colonel Brandon, who lives nearby, volunteers to go and bring back Marianne's mother. That night too, Willoughby arrives and reveals to Elinor that his love for Marianne had been genuine. However, the callous way in which he talks of Eliza and his wife lessens her pity for him.

Marianne recovers from her illness and, learning of Elinor’s own silent heartache, becomes ashamed of her ostentatious grief, vowing to be guided by her sister’s good sense and amend her behaviour in future.

After their return home, a family servant meets Lucy passing through the nearbymarket townand brings them the message that she has married and is now Mrs Ferrars. This final act of spite becomes obvious when Edward arrives to reveal that Lucy had jilted him and married his now wealthy brother. After ordaining, Edward marries Elinor, while Marianne later marries Colonel Brandon. The two sisters can now live as neighbours and in harmony with each other.

Jane Austen wrote the first draft of the novel inepistolary form, perhaps as early as 1795 when she was about 19 years old; or 1797, at age 21. She is said to have given it the working titleElinor and Marianne. Later she changed the form to a narrative and the title toSense and Sensibility.[3]

Austen drew inspiration forSense and Sensibilityfrom other novels of the 1790s that treated similar themes, including Adam Stevenson'sLife and Love(1785) which he had written about himself and a relationship that was not meant to be.Jane West'sA Gossip's Story(1796), which features one sister full of rational sense and another sister of romantic, emotive sensibility, is considered to have been an inspiration as well. West's romantic sister-heroine also shares her first name, Marianne, with Austen's. There are further textual similarities, described in a modern edition of West's novel.[4]

Austen may have drawn on her knowledge ofWarren Hastings, the firstGovernor-General of India, in her portrayal ofColonel Brandon. Just as Eliza Brandon was rumoured to be the Colonel’s love child, Hastings had been rumoured to be the biological father of Austen's cousinEliza de Feuillide. Linda Robinson Walker argues that Hastings ""hauntsSense and Sensibilityin the character of Colonel Brandon"": both left for India at the age of seventeen; Hastings may have had an illegitimate daughter named Eliza; both Hastings and Brandon participated in a duel.[5]

Early reviews ofSense and Sensibilityfocused on the novel as providing lessons in conduct (which would be debated by later critics), as well as reviewing the characters. TheNorton Critical EditionofSense and Sensibilitycontains a number of such responses in its supplementary material. An ""Unsigned Review"" in the February 1812Critical Reviewpraises the novel as well-written and realistic, with well-drawn characters and a ""highly pleasing"" plot in which ""the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing"".[6]Elinor and her mother are praised, while Marianne's extreme sensibility is seen as bringing unhappiness on herself.[6]

Another ""Unsigned Review"" from the May 1812British Criticfurther emphasises the novel's function as a type of conduct book. In this author's opinion, Austen's favouring of Elinor's temperament over Marianne's provides the lesson.[6]The reviewer claims that ""the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life, of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand, and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other.""[6]He goes on to state that the book contains ""many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life"" within a ""very pleasing and entertaining narrative.""[6]

W. F. Pollock's 1861 article forFrasier's Magazine,on ""British Novelists"" is described as an ""early example of what would become the customary view ofSense and Sensibility.""[7]In addition to emphasising the novel's morality, Pollock reviews the characters in catalogue-like fashion, allotting praise and criticism on the assumption that Austen favours Elinor's point of view and temperament.[7]and extending it to the minor characters. Mrs Palmer is silly, Sir John Dashwood is selfish, the behaviour of the Steele sisters is vulgar.[7]However, an anonymous piece titled ""Miss Austen"" published in 1866 inThe Englishwoman's Domestic Magazinedeparts from other early criticism in sympathising with Marianne over Elinor, claiming that Elinor is ""too good"" a character.[8]The article also differs from other reviews in its claim that the ""prevailing merit"" of the book is not in its sketch of the two sisters; rather, the book is effective because of its ""excellent treatment of the subordinate characters.""[8]Alice Meynell's 1894 article ""The Classic Novelist"" in thePall Mall Gazettealso concurs with Austen's attention to small things and minor characters and small matters since ""that which makes life, art, and work trivial is a triviality of relations.""[9]Also discussed is the children's function in highlighting ""the folly of their mothers"", especially in Lady Middleton's case.[9]

As used by Austen, the word ""sense"" signifies good judgment, wisdom, or prudence, and ""sensibility"" signifies sensitivity, sympathy, or emotionality. By changing the title from the names of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in her first choice of title to that of their qualities, Austen adds ""philosophical depth"" to what began as a sketch of two characters.[10]However, these characteristics, as demonstrated through the dominant behaviour of the sisters, are not mutually exclusive. Although their qualities are compared and contrasted through means of the plot, neither sister is a one-sided caricature. Humanised through emotional suffering, Marianne's sympathy for her sister teaches her self-control and prudence, while Elinor learns to express her emotions more overtly.[11]

Nevertheless, the changes to the original novel's structure are never resolved in the eyes of some critics.A. Walton Litzjudged thatSense and Sensibilityis ""caught uneasily between burlesque and the serious novel…in which the crude antitheses of the original structure were never successfully overcome"".Tony Tannersees a shift of view instead to ""the tensions between the potential instability of the individual and the required stabilities of society"", as demonstrated by the influence of the governing qualities on the younger and the older sister. While sensibility has its positive aspects, its over-cultivation leads in the novel to thepsychosomatic disordersto which Marianne nearly succumbs.[12]

Claire Tomalintoo argues thatSense and Sensibilityhas a ""wobble in its approach"", which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph.[13]Austen characterises Marianne as a sweet person with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending.[14]

InRachel Brownstein’s opinion, the differences between the Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having an ""excellent heart"" and being capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels, while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite, and less impulsive than Marianne, who loves poetry, taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is this very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges.[15]

Mary Favret explores the contrast through examining popular forms of fiction of the time.[16]Inepistolary fiction, action, dialogue, and character interactions are all reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In exploring Austen's fraught relationship with such fiction, Favret surveys how Austen ""wrestled with epistolary form"" in previous writings and, with the publication ofSense and Sensibility, ""announced her victory over the constraints of the letter"". Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her ""admired predecessor,Samuel Richardson"" in that Austen's letters are ""a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting.""[16]According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an ""anti-epistolary heroine"" whose ""inner world"" of thoughts and feelings does not find ""direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story.""[16]Sense and Sensibilityestablishes what Favret calls a ""new privacy"" in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters.[16]This new privacy is a ""less constraining mode of narration"" in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters.[16]Favret claims that inSense and Sensibility, Austen wants to ""recontextualize"" the letter and bring it into a ""new realism.""[16]Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter ""prove false"".[16]Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses the correspondence of both of the sisters to emphasise the contrasts in their personalities.[16]When both write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the ""dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'"" and Marianne writes a ""vaguely illicit letter"" reflecting her characterisation as the ""sensitive"" sister"".[16]What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other.[16]

A common theme of Austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family, particularly wills, the rights of first and second sons, and lines of inheritance. Gene Ruoff's bookJane Austen's Sense and Sensibilityexplores these issues in an extended discussion of the novel. The first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance. These topics reveal what Ruoff calls ""the cultural fixation on priority of male birth"".[17]According to Ruoff, male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations. Ruoff observes that, within the linear family, the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit.[17]When Robert Ferrars becomes his mother's heir, Edward is no longer appealing to his ""opportunistic"" fiancée Lucy, who quickly turns her attention to the foppish Robert and ""entraps him"" in order to secure the inheritance for herself.[17]Ruoff comments that Lucy is specifically aiming for the heir because of the monetary advantage.[17]William Galperin, in his bookThe History Austen,comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of women.[18]Because of this vulnerability, Galperin contends thatSense and Sensibilityshowsmarriageas the only practical solution ""against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman.""[18]

Feministcritics have long been engaged in conversations about Jane Austen, andSense and Sensibilityhas figured in these discussions, especially in the context of the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning. Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminalfeministworkThe Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imaginationcontains several discussions of this novel. The authors read the beginning ofSense and Sensibilityas a retelling ofKing Learfrom a female perspective and contend that these ""reversals imply that male traditions need to be evaluated and reinterpreted from a female perspective.""[19]Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on women, particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance. InSense and Sensibilitythey educe the fact that Mr. John Dashwood cuts off his stepmother and half sisters from their home as well as promised income, as an instance of these effects. They also point to the ""despised"" Mrs. Ferrars's tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her elder son, Edward Ferrars, as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary.[19]Gilbert and Gubar contend that whileSense and Sensibility's ultimate message is that ""young women like Marianne and Elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding a male protector"", women such as Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele demonstrate how women can ""themselves become agents of repression, manipulators of conventions, and survivors.""[19]In order to protect themselves and their own interests, Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele must participate in the same patriarchal system that oppresses them.

In the chapter ""Sense and Sensibility:Opinions Too Common and Too Dangerous"", from her bookJane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel,Claudia Johnsonalso gives a feminist reading ofSense and Sensibility.She differs from previous critics, especially the earliest ones, in her contention thatSense and Sensibilityis not, as it is often assumed to be, a ""dramatized conduct book"" that values ""female prudence"" (associated with Elinor's sense) over ""female impetuosity"" (associated with Marianne's sensibility).[20]Rather, Johnson seesSense and Sensibilityas a ""dark and disenchanted novel"" that views ""institutions of order"" such as property, marriage, and family in a negative light, an attitude that makes the novel the ""most attuned to social criticism"" of Austen's works.[20]According to Johnson,Sense and Sensibilitycritically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community.[20]Key to Austen's criticism of society, runs Johnson's argument, is the depiction of the unfair marginalisation of women resulting from the ""death or simple absence of male protectors.""[20]Additionally, the male characters inSense and Sensibilityare depicted unfavourably. Johnson calls the gentlemen inSense and Sensibility""uncommitted sorts"" who ""move on, more or less unencumbered by human wreckage from the past.""[20]Johnson compares Edward to Willoughby in this regard, claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical; Johnson calls them both ""weak, duplicitous, and selfish,"" lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which Austen endows other ""exemplary gentlemen"" in her work.[20]

Mary Poovey's analysis inThe Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works ofMary Wollstonecraft,Mary Shelleyand Jane Austenconcurs with Johnson's on the dark tone ofSense and Sensibility.Poovey contends thatSense and Sensibilityhas a ""somber tone"" in which conflict breaks out between Austen's engagement with her ""self-assertive characters"" and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially ""anarchic"" desires.[21]Austen shows, according to Poovey, this conflict between individual desire and the restraint of moral principles through the character of Elinor herself.[21]Except for Elinor, all of the female characters inSense and Sensibilityexperience some kind of female excess. Poovey argues that while Austen does recognise ""the limitations of social institutions"", she demonstrates the necessity of controlling the ""dangerous excesses of female feeling"" rather than liberating them.[21]She does so by demonstrating that Elinor's self-denial, especially in her keeping of Lucy Steele's secret and willingness to help Edward, even though both of these actions were hurtful to her, ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of others.[21]In this way, Poovey contends that Austen suggests that the submission to society that Elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life.

The new discipline ofEcocriticismextends the examination of imbalance in Austen’s novels and finds that she ""antedated Victorian novelists in predicting early signs of environmental manipulation and identifying the attitudes and practices that led to the ecological collapse of early nineteenth century England"".[22]Susan Rowland's article ""The 'Real Work': Ecocritical Alchemy and Jane Austen'sSense and Sensibility"" studies the effects of alienation upon Edward Ferrars and Marianne Dashwood. Edward feels out of place in society because he lacks what Rowland calls ""useful employment"".[23]His condition underlines the historical problem of labour in Western industrialised societies. Edward's alienation also represents ""the progressive estrangement from nonhuman nature""[23]in modern society as a whole, only resolved in his case by becoming a ""pastor"". Rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it, serving merely through the fact of ownership to bolster their place in the social order. Marianne’s emotional estrangement begins as she is ripped from the aesthetic enjoyment of her home environment, although ultimately she finds a new identity by uniting with Colonel Brandon on his estate at Delaford.[23]

In 1811, Thomas Egerton of the Military Library publishing house in London accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes. Austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher a commission on sales. The cost of publication was more than a third of Austen's annual household income of £460 (about £15,000 in 2008 currency).[24]She made a profit of £140 (almost £5,000 in 2008 currency)[24]on the first edition, which sold all 750 printed copies by July 1813. A second edition was advertised in October 1813.

Sense and Sensibilitywas the first Austen title to be republished in England after her death, and the first illustrated Austen book produced in Britain, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series of 1833.[25]The novel has been in continuous publication since 1811, and has many times been illustrated, excerpted, abridged, and adapted for stage, film, and television.[26]

The novel was soon translated into French by MadameIsabelle de MontolieuasRaison et Sensibilité, ou les deux manières d'aimer(1815).[27]Montolieu had only the most basic knowledge of English, and her translations were more ""imitations"" of Austen's novels as Montolieu had her assistants provide a summary of Austen's novels, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters.[27]The ""translation"" ofSense and Sensibilityby Montolieu changes entire scenes and characters, for example having Marianne call Willoughby an ""angel"" and an ""Adonis"" upon first meeting him, lines that are not in the English original.[28]Likewise, the scene where Mrs Dashwood criticises her husband for planning to subsidise his widowed stepmother because it might be disadvantageous to ""our little Harry"", Mrs Dashwood soon forgets about Harry and it is made apparent her objections are founded in greed; Montolieu altered the scene by having Mrs Dashwood continuing to speak of ""our little Harry"" as the basis of her objections, completely changing her motives.[29]When Elinor learns the Ferrars who married Lucy Steele is Robert, not Edward, Montolieu adds a scene, in which Edward, the Dashwood sisters and their mother all break down in tears while clasping hands, that was not in the original.[30]Austen has the marriage of Robert Ferrars and Lucy Steele end well while Montolieu changes the marriage into a failure.[31]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42671,Pride and Prejudice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice,"In the early 19th century, theBennet familylives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton inHertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.

The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife"". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friendMr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance withElizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is ""not handsome enough"". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.

Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patronessLady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officerGeorge Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him unpleasantly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.

In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins inKent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the ""living"" his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerabledowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.

Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour ofDerbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visitPemberley, Darcy's estate, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Gardiner has paid Wickham. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted.











Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes ofPride and Prejudicebut Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initiallyFirst Impressions), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. ""After the success ofSense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.""

The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.""[8]The phrase ""pride and prejudice"" had been used over the preceding two centuries byJoseph Hall,Jeremy Taylor,Joseph AddisonandSamuel Johnson.[9][10]Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage inFanny Burney'sCecilia(1782), a novel she is known to have admired:

A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[12]Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. InPride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing.[12]Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[13]

The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43936,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz,"Dorothy Galeis a young girl who lives with herAunt Em,Uncle Henry, and dog,Toto, on a farm on theKansasprairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a ""cyclone"" (more accurately atornado) that deposits them and the farmhouse intoMunchkin Countryin the magicalLand of Oz. The falling house has killed theWicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of theMunchkins. TheGood Witch of the Northarrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magicalsilver shoesthat originally belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home to Kansas is to follow theyellow brick roadto theEmerald Cityand ask the great and powerfulWizard of Ozto help her. As Dorothy embarks on her journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving her magical protection from harm.

On her way down the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin namedBoq. The next day, she frees aScarecrowfrom the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted joints of aTin Woodman, and meets aCowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard.

After several adventures, the travelers arrive at the Emerald City and meet theGuardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. He appears to Dorothy as a giant head, to the Scarecrow as a lovely lady, to the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and to the Lion as a ball of fire, with the intention of scaring them all. He agrees to help them all if they kill theWicked Witch of the West, who rules overWinkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the Witch of the West.

The Wicked Witch of the West sees the travelers approaching with her one telescopic eye. She sends a pack of wolves to tear them to pieces, but the Tin Woodman kills them with his axe. She sends a flock of wild crows to peck their eyes out, but the Scarecrow kills them by twisting their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they are killed while trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's straw hides the others. She sends a dozen of her Winkie slaves to attack them, but the Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses the power of her Golden Cap to send theWinged Monkeysto capture Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion. She cages the Lion, scatters the straw of the Scarecrow, and dents the Tin Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the witch's personal slave, while the Witch schemes to steal her silver shoes' powerful magic.

The witch successfully tricks Dorothy out of one of her silver shoes. Angered, she throws a bucket of water at the witch and is shocked to see her melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed from her tyranny and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the witch's Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her friends back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and his band are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceressGayelettefrom the North, and that Dorothy may use it to summon them two more times.

When Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, Toto tips over a screen in a corner of the throne room that reveals ""the Wizard"", who sadly explains he is a humbug—an ordinary old man who, by a hot air balloon, came to Oz long ago fromOmaha. He provides the Scarecrow with a head full of bran, pins, and needles (""a lot of bran-new brains""), the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Lion a potion of ""courage"". Their faith in his power gives these items a focus for their desires. He decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and then go back to Omaha in his balloon. At the send-off, he appoints the Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy goes after him, but the ropes holding the balloon break and the Wizard floats away.

Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys and tells them to carry her and Toto home, but they explain they cannot cross the desert surrounding Oz. TheSoldier with the Green Whiskersinforms Dorothy thatGlinda, the Good Witch of the Southmay be able to help her return home, so the travelers begin their journey to see Glinda's castle inQuadling Country. On the way, the Lion kills a giant spider who is terrorizing the animals in a forest. They ask him to become their king, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys a third time to fly them over a hill to Glinda's castle.

Glinda greets them and reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes can take her anywhere she wishes to go. She embraces her friends, all of whom will be returned to their new kingdoms through Glinda's three uses of the Golden Cap: the Scarecrow to the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman to Winkie Country, and the Lion to the forest; after which the cap will be given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, freeing him and his band. Dorothy takes Toto in her arms, knocks her heels together three times, and wishes to return home. Instantly, she begins whirling through the air and rolling on the grass of the Kansas prairie, up to the farmhouse, though the silver shoes fall off her feet en route and are lost in theDeadly Desert. She runs to Aunt Em, saying ""I'm so glad to be home again!""

The book was illustrated by Baum's friend and collaboratorW. W. Denslow, who also co-held the copyright. The design was lavish for the time, with illustrations on many pages, backgrounds in different colors, and several color plate illustrations.[12]The typeface featured the newly designedMonotype Old Style. In September 1900, TheGrand Rapids Heraldwrote that Denslow's illustrations are ""quite as much of the story as in the writing"". The editorial opined that had it not been for Denslow's pictures, the readers would be unable to picture precisely the figures of Dorothy, Toto, and the other characters.[13]

Denslow's illustrations were so well known that merchants of many products obtained permission to use them to promote their wares. The forms of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, and Dorothy were made into rubber and metal sculptures. Costume jewelry, mechanical toys, and soap were also designed using their figures.[14]The distinctive look of Denslow's illustrations led to imitators at the time, most notably Eva Katherine Gibson'sZauberlinda, the Wise Witch, which mimicked both the typography and the illustration design ofOz.[15]

A new edition of the book appeared in 1944, with illustrations by Evelyn Copelman.[16][17]Although it was claimed that the new illustrations were based on Denslow's originals, they more closely resemble the characters as seen in the famous1939 film versionof Baum's book.[18]

According to Baum's son,Harry Neal, the author had often told his children ""whimsical stories before they became material for his books"".[19]Harry Baum called his father the ""swellest man I knew"", a man who was able to give a decent reason as to whyblack birds cooked in a piecould afterwards get out and sing.[19]

Many of the characters, props, and ideas in the novel were drawn from Baum's personal life and experiences.[20]Baum held different jobs, moved a lot, and was exposed to many people, so the inspiration for the story could have been taken from many different aspects of his life.[20]In the introduction to the story, Baum writes that ""it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out"".[21]

As a child, Baum frequently had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field.[22]Moments before the scarecrow's ""ragged hay fingers"" nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow.[23]In the early 1880s, Baum's playMatcheswas being performed when a ""flicker from a kerosene lantern sparked the rafters"", causing the Baum opera house to be consumed by flames. Scholar Evan I. Schwartz suggested that this might have inspired the Scarecrow's severest terror: ""There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of. A lighted match.""[24]

According to Baum's son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a wash-boiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and from the bottom of a saucepan he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman.[25]

Baum's wifeMaud Gagefrequently visited their newborn niece, Dorothy Louise Gage, whom she adored as the daughter she never had. The infant became gravely sick and died at the age of five months inBloomington, Illinois, on November 11, 1898, from ""congestion of the brain"". Maud was devastated.[26]To assuage her distress, Baum made his protagonist ofThe Wonderful Wizard of Oza girl named Dorothy, and he dedicated the book to his wife.[27]The baby was buried atEvergreen Cemetery, where her gravestone has a statue of the character Dorothy placed next to it.[28]Baum's mother-in-law, activistMatilda Joslyn Gage, has also been cited as one of the inspirations for Dorothy.[29]

Decades later,Jocelyn Burdick—the daughter of Baum's other niece, Magdalena Carpenter, and a formerDemocraticU.S. SenatorfromNorth Dakota—asserted that her mother also partly inspired the character of Dorothy.[30]Burdick claimed that her great-uncle spent ""considerable time at the Сarpenter homestead ... and became very attached to Magdalena"".[30]Burdick has reported many similarities between her mother's homestead and the farm of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.[30]

Uncle Henrywas modeled after Henry Gage, Baum's father-in-law. Bossed around by his wifeMatilda, Henry rarely dissented with her. He flourished in business, though, and his neighbors looked up to him. Likewise, Uncle Henry was a ""passive but hard-working man"" who ""looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke"".[31]

The witches in the novel were influenced bywitch-huntingresearch gathered by Matilda Joslyn Gage. The stories of barbarous acts against accused witches scared Baum. Two key events in the novel involve wicked witches who meet their death through metaphorical means.[32]Baum's biographers have also drawn correlations between Baum'sGood Witchand Gage's feminist writings.[29]

In 1890, Baum lived inAberdeen, South Dakotaduring a drought, and he wrote a story in his ""Our Landlady"" column in Aberdeen'sThe Saturday Pioneerabout a farmer who gave green goggles to his horses, causing them to believe that the wood chips that they were eating were pieces of grass.[33]Similarly, the Wizard made the people in the Emerald City wear green goggles so that they would believe that their city was built from emeralds.[34]

During Baum's short stay in Aberdeen, the dissemination of myths about the West continued. However, the West, instead of being a wonderland, turned into a wasteland because of a drought and a depression. In 1891, Baum moved his family from South Dakota to Chicago. At that time, Chicago was getting ready for theWorld's Columbian Expositionin 1893. Scholar Laura Barrett stated that Chicago was ""considerably more akin to Oz than to Kansas"". After discovering that the myths about the West's incalculable riches were baseless, Baum created ""an extension of the American frontier in Oz"". In many respects, Baum's creation is similar to the actual frontier save for the fact that the West was still undeveloped at the time. The Munchkins Dorothy encounters at the beginning of the novel represent farmers, as do the Winkies she later meets.[35]

Local legend has it that Oz, also known as the Emerald City, was inspired by a prominent castle-like building in the community of Castle Park nearHolland, Michigan, where Baum lived during the summer. The yellow brick road was derived from a road at that time paved by yellow bricks, located inPeekskill, New York, where Baum attended thePeekskill Military Academy. Baum scholars often refer to the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (the ""White City"") as an inspiration for the Emerald City. Other legends suggest that the inspiration came from theHotel Del Coronadonear San Diego, California. Baum was a frequent guest at the hotel and had written several of the Oz books there.[36]In a 1903 interview withThe Publishers' Weekly,[37]Baum said that the name ""Oz"" came from his file cabinet labeled ""O–Z"".[38][22]

Some critics have suggested that Baum's Oz may have been inspired by Australia. Australia is often colloquially spelled or referred to as ""Oz"". Furthermore, inOzma of Oz(1907), Dorothy gets back to Oz as the result of a storm at sea while she and Uncle Henry are traveling by ship to Australia. Like Australia, Oz is an island continent somewhere to the west of California with inhabited regions bordering on a great desert. Baum perhaps intended Oz to be Australia or a magical land in the center of the great Australian desert.[39]

In addition to being influenced by the fairy-tales of theBrothers GrimmandHans Christian Andersen,[40]Baum was significantly influenced by English writerLewis Carroll's 1865 novelAlice's Adventures in Wonderland.[41]Although Baum found the plot of Carroll's novel to be incoherent, he identified the book's source of popularity asAliceherself—a child with whom younger readers could identify, and this influenced Baum's choice of Dorothy as his protagonist.[40]

Although influenced by Carroll's distinctly English work, Baum nonetheless sought to create a story that had recognizable American elements, such as farming and industrialization.[42]Consequently, Baum combined the conventional features of afairy talesuch aswitchesandwizardswith well-known fixtures in his young readers' Midwestern lives such asscarecrowsandcornfields.[43]

The original illustrator of the novel,W. W. Denslow, aided in the development of Baum's story and greatly influenced the way it has been interpreted.[22]Baum and Denslow had a close working relationship and worked together to create the presentation of the story through the images and the text.[22]Color is an important element of the story and is present throughout the images, with each chapter having a different color representation. Denslow also added characteristics to his drawings that Baum never described. For example, Denslow drew a house and the gates of the Emerald City with faces on them.

In the laterOzbooks,John R. Neill, who illustrated all the sequels, continued to use elements from Denslow's earlier illustrations, including faces on the Emerald City's gates.[44]Another aspect is the Tin Woodman's funnel hat, which is not mentioned in the text until later books but appears in most artists' interpretation of the character, including the stage and film productions of 1902–1909, 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1931, 1933, 1939, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1992, and others. One of the earliest illustrators not to include a funnel hat was Russell H. Schulz in the 1957Whitman Publishingedition—Schulz depicted him wearing a pot on his head. Libico Maraja's illustrations, which first appeared in a 1957 Italian edition and have also appeared in English-language and other editions, are well known for depicting him bareheaded.

The Wonderful Wizard of Ozreceived positive critical reviews upon release. In a September 1900 review,The New York Timespraised the novel, writing that it would appeal to child readers and to younger children who could not read yet. The review also praised the illustrations for being a pleasant complement to the text.[45]

During the subsequent decades after the novel's publication in 1900, it received little critical analysis from scholars of children's literature. Lists of suggested reading published for juvenile readers never contained Baum's work,[46]and his works were rarely assigned in classrooms.[47]This lack of interest stemmed from the scholars' misgivings about fantasy, as well as to their belief that lengthy series had little literary merit.[46]

It frequently came under fire in later decades. In 1957, the director of Detroit's libraries bannedThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozfor having ""no value"" for children of today, for supporting ""negativism"", and for bringing children's minds to a ""cowardly level"". ProfessorRussel B. NyeofMichigan State Universitycountered that ""if the message of the Oz books—love, kindness, and unselfishness make the world a better place—seems of no value today"", then maybe the time is ripe for ""reassess[ing] a good many other things besides the Detroit library's approved list of children's books"".[48]

In 1986, sevenFundamentalist Christianfamilies in Tennessee opposed the novel's inclusion in the public school syllabus and filed a lawsuit.[49]They based their opposition to the novel on its depicting benevolent witches and promoting the belief that integral human attributes were ""individually developed rather than God-given"".[49]One parent said: ""I do not want my children seduced into godless supernaturalism.""[50]Other reasons included the novel's teaching that females are equal to males and that animals are personified and can speak. The judge ruled that when the novel was being discussed in class, the parents were allowed to have their children leave the classroom.[51]

In April 2000, theLibrary of CongressdeclaredThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozto be ""America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale"", also naming it the first American fantasy for children and one of the most-read children's books.[7]Leonard Everett Fisher ofThe Horn Book Magazinewrote in 2000 thatOzhas ""a timeless message from a less complex era, and it continues to resonate"". The challenge of valuing oneself during impending adversity has not, Fisher noted, lessened during the prior 100 years.[52]Two years later, in a 2002 review, Bill Delaney ofSalem Presspraised Baum for giving children the opportunity to discover magic in the mundane things in their everyday lives. He further commended Baum for teaching ""millions of children to love reading during their crucial formative years"".[43]In 2012 it was ranked number 41 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published bySchool Library Journal.[53]

After George M. Hill's bankruptcy in 1902, copyright in the book passed to theBowen-Merrill CompanyofIndianapolis, which published most of Baum's other books from 1901 to 1903, both reprints (Father Goose, His Book,The Magical Monarch of Mo,American Fairy Tales,Dot and Tot of Merryland) and new works (The Master Key,The Army Alphabet,The Navy Alphabet,The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus,The Enchanted Island of Yew,The Songs of Father Goose). Bowen-Merrill's 1903 edition initially had the titleThe New Wizard of Oz, to distinguish it fromthe 1902 musical, which was by then better known than the original book and had a very different story.[54]The word ""New"" was quickly dropped in subsequent printings, leaving the now-familiar shortened title,The Wizard of Oz, and some minor textual changes were added, such as to ""yellow daises"", and changing a chapter title from ""The Rescue"" to ""How the Four Were Reunited"". The editions they published lacked most of the in-text color and color plates of the original. Many cost-cutting measures were implemented, including removal of some of the color printing without replacing it with black, printing nothing rather than the beard of theSoldier with the Green Whiskers.

When Baum filed for bankruptcy after his critically and popularly successful film and stage productionThe Fairylogue and Radio-Playsfailed to make back its production costs, Baum lost the rights to all of the books published by what was now called Bobbs-Merrill, and they were licensed to the M. A. Donahue Company, which printed them in significantly cheaper ""blotting paper"" editions with advertising that directly competed with Baum's more recent books, published by theReilly & BrittonCompany, from which he was making his living, explicitly hurting sales ofThe Patchwork Girl of Oz, the new Oz book for 1913, to boost sales ofWizard, which Donahue called in a full-page ad inThe Publishers' Weekly(June 28, 1913), Baum's ""one pre-eminently great Juvenile Book"". In a letter to Baum dated December 31, 1914, F. K. Reilly lamented that the averagebuyeremployed by a retail store would not understand why he should be expected to spend 75 cents for a copy ofTik-Tok of Ozwhen he could buy a copy ofWizardfor between 33 and 36 cents. Baum had previously written a letter complaining about the Donahue deal, which he did not know about until it was fait accompli, and one of the investors who heldThe Wizard of Ozrights had inquired why the royalty was only five or six cents per copy, depending on quantity sold, which made no sense to Baum.[55]

A new edition from Bobbs-Merrill in 1949 illustrated by Evelyn Copelman, again titledThe New Wizard of Oz, paid lip service to Denslow but was based strongly, apart from the Lion, on the MGM movie. Copelman had illustrated a new edition ofThe Magical Monarch of Motwo years earlier.[56]

It was not until the book entered the public domain in 1956 that new editions, either with the original color plates, or new illustrations, proliferated.[57]A revised version of Copelman's artwork was published in aGrosset & Dunlapedition, and Reilly & Lee (formerly Reilly & Britton) published an edition in line with the Oz sequels, which had previously treatedThe Marvelous Land of Ozas the first Oz book,[58]not having the publication rights toWizard, with new illustrations by Dale Ulrey.[17]Ulrey had previously illustratedJack Snow'sJaglon and the Tiger-Faries, an expansion of a Baum short story ""The Story of Jaglon"", and a 1955 edition ofThe Tin Woodman of Oz, though both sold poorly. Later Reilly & Lee editions used Denslow's original illustrations.

Notable more recent editions are the 1986 Pennyroyal edition illustrated byBarry Moser, which was reprinted by theUniversity of California Press, and the 2000The Annotated Wizard of Ozedited byMichael Patrick Hearn(heavily revised from a 1972 edition that was printed in a wide format that allowed for it to be a facsimile of the original edition with notes and additional illustrations at the sides), which was published byW. W. Nortonand included all the original color illustrations, as well as supplemental artwork byDenslow. Other centennial editions includedUniversity Press of Kansas'sKansas Centennial Edition, illustrated byMichael McCurdywith black-and-white illustrations, andRobert Sabuda'spop-up book."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/143,The Mayor of Casterbridge,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayor_of_Casterbridge,"At a country fair at Weydon Priors inWessex, Michael Henchard, a 21-year-oldhay-trusser, argues with his wife Susan. Drunk on rum-lacedfurmityheauctionsher off, along with their baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane, to Richard Newson, a sailor, for fiveguineas. Sober and remorseful the next day, he is unable to find his family. He vows not to touch liquor again for 21 years.

Believing the auction to be legally binding, Susan lives as Newson's wife for 18 years. After Newson is lost at sea, Susan, lacking any means of support, decides to seek out Henchard again, taking her daughter with her. Susan has told Elizabeth-Jane little about Henchard, and the young woman knows only that he is a relation by marriage. Susan discovers that Henchard has become a very successful hay andgrain merchantand mayor of Casterbridge, known for his staunch sobriety. He has avoided explaining how he lost his wife, allowing people to assume he is a widower.

When the couple are reunited, Henchard proposes remarrying Susan after a sham courtship, this in his view being the simplest and most discreet way to remedy matters and to prevent Elizabeth-Jane learning of their disgrace. To do this, however, he is forced to break off an engagement with a woman named Lucetta Templeman, who had nursed him when he was ill.

Donald Farfrae, a young and energetic Scotsman passing through Casterbridge, helps Henchard by showing him how to salvage substandard grain he has bought. Henchard takes a liking to the man, persuades him not to emigrate, and hires him as his cornfactor, rudely turning away a man named Jopp to whom he had already offered the job. Farfrae is extremely successful in the role, and increasingly outshines his employer. When he catches the eye of Elizabeth-Jane, Henchard dismisses him and Farfrae sets himself up as an independent merchant. Farfrae conducts himself with scrupulous honesty, but Henchard is so determined to ruin his rival that he makes risky business decisions that prove disastrous.

Susan falls ill and dies shortly after the couple's remarriage, leaving Henchard a letter to be opened on the day of Elizabeth-Jane's wedding. Henchard reads the letter, which is not properly sealed, and learns that Elizabeth-Jane is not in fact his daughter, but Newson's – his Elizabeth-Jane having died as an infant. Henchard's new knowledge causes him to behave coldly towards the second Elizabeth-Jane.

Elizabeth-Jane accepts a position as companion to Lucetta, a newcomer, unaware that she had had a relationship with Henchard which resulted in her social ruin. Now wealthy after receiving an inheritance from her aunt, and learning that Henchard's wife had died, Lucetta has come to Casterbridge to marry him. However, on meeting Farfrae, she becomes attracted to him, and he to her.

Henchard's financial difficulties persuade him that he should marry Lucetta quickly. But she is in love with Farfrae, and the couple run away one weekend to get married, not telling Henchard until after the fact. Henchard's credit collapses and he goes bankrupt. Farfrae buys Henchard's old business and tries to help Henchard by employing him as ajourneyman.

Lucetta asks Henchard to return her old love letters, and Henchard asks Jopp to take them to her. Jopp, who still bears a grudge for having been cheated out of the position of factor, opens the letters and reads them out loud at an inn. Some of the townspeople publicly shame Henchard and Lucetta, creating effigies of them in askimmington ride. Lucetta is so devastated by the spectacle that she collapses, has a miscarriage, and dies.

The next day, Newson – who it transpires was not lost at sea – arrives at Henchard's door asking about his daughter. Henchard, who has come to value her kindness to him, is afraid of losing her companionship and tells Newson she is dead. Newson leaves in sorrow. After 21 years, Henchard's vow of abstinence expires, and he starts drinking again.

Eventually discovering that he has been lied to, Newson returns, and Henchard disappears rather than endure a confrontation. On the day of Elizabeth-Jane's wedding to Farfrae, Henchard comes back, timidly seeking a reconciliation. She rebuffs him, and he departs for good. Later, regretting her coldness, she and Farfrae set out to find him. They arrive too late, and learn that he has died alone. They also find his last written statement: his dying wish is to be forgotten.

The book is one ofHardy's Wessex novels, and is set largely in the fictional town of Casterbridge, based onDorchesterinDorset.[2]The author intended Casterbridge to be an imaginative presentation of certain aspects of the town as he remembered it in the ""dream"" of his childhood.[3]

Although the opening sentence of the novel states that the events described took place ""before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span"" the date of Hardy's own childhood places it rather later – in the mid-to-late 1840s.[4][3]

The concept of a man selling his wife was not new in Hardy's era. His story is set in the first half of the 19th century, when various newspapers reported instances of men selling their wives. For example, inHuddersfieldon 19 August 1806, a tradesman named Gledhill accepted half aguinea(equivalent to £56.34 in 2023) for his ""young and beautiful"" wife and ""delivered her to the purchaser at the Market Cross before a great concourse of people"",[5]""who wished the purchaser good luck of his bargain"".[6]In October 1830 aSheffieldman sold his wife in the market atRotherhamfor three pence (equivalent to £1.36 in 2023).[7]In 1849 a more complex sale-of-wife story came to light on Hardy's patch, in Dorset. Around 1830 one Simon Mitchell sold his wife for £2 (equivalent to £226.19 in 2023).[8]The wife and purchaser subsequently lived together and had seven children. However, by 1849 Mitchell's wife was in theTauntonworkhouse, and three of her children had died of an epidemic there. Mitchell, now described as an ""old man"", was summonsed on the grounds that he should support his wife, but:[9]

Hardy started work onThe Mayor of Casterbridgein the spring of 1884, after a three-year pause.[2]He completed it in a little over a year, and it was first issued in weekly parts in January 1886, followed by full publication in May 1886.[10]A reader for the publisher,Smith, Elder & Co.was not impressed and complained that the lack ofgentryamong the characters made it uninteresting.  It was issued with a small print run of only 750 copies.[11]

Hardy himself felt that in his efforts to get an incident into almost every weekly instalment he had added events to the narrative somewhat too freely, resulting in over-elaboration.[12]However, he was deeply affected, telling a friend that the novel was the only tragedy that made him weep while writing it.[13]

In her 2006 biography of Thomas Hardy, the authorClaire Tomalincalled the book a masterpiece, a deeply imagined dramatic and poetic work, with a narrative on a grand scale and paced with extraordinary moments.[14]She praised it as being built on the territory in which Hardy worked best, in which the rural landscape is drawn with a naturalist's eye and in which country people play out their lives between custom and education, work and ideas, and love of place and experience of change.[15]Hardy's portrait of Henchard – ""depressive, black-tempered, self-destructive, and also lovable as a child is lovable"" –  she considered one of his strongest achievements.[13]She did concur with Hardy, however, in noting that he tried to pack in too many incidents.[16]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61851,El crimen y el castigo (Spanish),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in a tiny rented room in Saint Petersburg. Isolated and antisocial, he has abandoned all attempts to support himself and is brooding obsessively on a scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawnbroker. On the pretext of pawning a watch, he visits her apartment, but he remains unable to commit himself. Later in a tavern, he makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Marmeladov tells him about his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has become aprostitutein order to support the family. The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister Dunya, who has been working as a governess, with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov. To escape her vulnerable position, and with hopes of helping her brother, Dunya has chosen to marry a wealthy suitor, Luzhin, whom they are coming to meet in Petersburg. Details in the letter suggest that Luzhin is a conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of Dunya's situation. Raskolnikov is enraged at his sister's sacrifice, feeling it is the same as what Sonya felt compelled to do. Painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence, his thoughts return to his idea. A further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it.

In a state of extreme nervous tension, Raskolnikov steals an axe and makes his way once more to the old woman's apartment. He gains access by pretending he has something to pawn, and then attacks her with the axe, killing her. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime. Shaken by his actions, he steals only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawnbroker's wealth untouched. Due to sheer good fortune, he manages to escape the building and return to his room undetected.

In a feverish and semi-delirious state Raskolnikov conceals the stolen items and falls asleep exhausted. He is greatly alarmed the next morning when he gets summoned to the police station, but it turns out to be in relation to a debt notice from his landlady. When the officers at the bureau begin talking about the murder, Raskolnikov faints. He quickly recovers, but he can see from their faces that he has aroused suspicion. Fearing a search, he hides the stolen items under a large rock in an empty yard, noticing in humiliation that he has not even checked how much money is in the purse. Without knowing why, he visits his old university friend Razumikhin, who observes that Raskolnikov seems to be seriously ill. Finally he returns to his room where he succumbs to his illness and falls into a prolonged delirium.

When he emerges several days later he finds that Razumikhin has tracked him down and has been nursing him. Still feverish, Raskolnikov listens nervously to a conversation between Razumikhin and the doctor about the status of the police investigation into the murders: amuzhikcalled Mikolka, who was working in a neighbouring flat at the time, has been detained, and the old woman's clients are being interviewed. They are interrupted by the arrival of Luzhin, Dunya's fiancé, who wishes to introduce himself, but Raskolnikov deliberately insults him and kicks him out. He angrily tells the others to leave as well, and then sneaks out himself. He looks for news about the murder, and seems almost to want to draw attention to his own part in it. He encounters the police official Zamyotov, who was present when he fainted in the bureau, and openly mocks the young man's unspoken suspicions. He returns to the scene of the crime and re-lives the sensations he experienced at the time. He angers the workmen and caretakers by asking casual questions about the murder, even suggesting that they accompany him to the police station to discuss it. As he contemplates whether or not to confess, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage. He rushes to help and succeeds in conveying the stricken man back to his family's apartment. Calling out for Sonya to forgive him, Marmeladov dies in his daughter's arms. Raskolnikov gives his last twenty five roubles (from money sent to him by his mother) to Marmeladov's consumptive widow, Katerina Ivanovna, saying it is the repayment of a debt to his friend.

Feeling renewed, Raskolnikov calls on Razumikhin, and they go back together to Raskolnikov's building. Upon entering his room Raskolnikov is deeply shocked to see his mother and sister sitting on the sofa. They have just arrived in Petersburg and are ecstatic to see him, but Raskolnikov is unable to speak, and collapses in a faint.

Razumikhin tends to Raskolnikov, and manages to convince the distressed mother and sister to return to their apartment. He goes with them, despite being drunk and rather overwhelmed by Dunya's beauty. When they return the next morning Raskolnikov has improved physically, but it becomes apparent that he is still mentally distracted and merely forcing himself to endure the meeting. He demands that Dunya break with Luzhin, but Dunya fiercely defends her motives for the marriage. Mrs Raskolnikova has received a note from Luzhin demanding that her son not be present at any future meetings between them.  He also informs her that he witnessed her son give the 25 rubles to ""an unmarried woman of immoral behavior"" (Sonya). Dunya has decided that a meeting, at which both Luzhin and her brother are present, must take place, and Raskolnikov agrees to attend that evening along with Razumikhin. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Sonya suddenly appears at his door. Timidly, she explains that he left his address with them last night, and that she has come to invite him to attend her father's funeral. As she leaves, Raskolnikov asks for her address and tells her that he will visit her soon.

At Raskolnikov's behest, Razumikhin takes him to see the detective Porfiry Petrovich, who is investigating the murders. Raskolnikov immediately senses that Porfiry knows that he is the murderer. Porfiry, who has just been discussing the case with Zamyotov, adopts an ironic tone during the conversation. He expresses extreme curiosity about an article that Raskolnikov wrote some months ago called 'On Crime', in which he suggests that certain rare individuals—the benefactors and geniuses of mankind—have a right to 'step across' legal or moral boundaries if those boundaries are an obstruction to the success of their idea. Raskolnikov defends himself skillfully, but he is alarmed and angered by Porfiry's insinuating tone. An appointment is made for an interview the following morning at the police bureau.

Leaving Razumikhin with his mother and sister, Raskolnikov returns to his own building. He is surprised to find an old artisan, whom he does not know, making inquiries about him. Raskolnikov tries to find out what he wants, but the artisan says only one word – ""murderer"", and walks off. Petrified, Raskolnikov returns to his room and falls into thought and then sleeps. He wakens from an eerie nightmare about the murder of the old woman to find another complete stranger present, this time a man of aristocratic appearance. The man politely introduces himself as Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov.

Svidrigailov indulges in an amiable but disjointed monologue, punctuated by Raskolnikov's terse interjections. He claims to no longer have any romantic interest in Dunya, but wants to stop her from marrying Luzhin, and offers her ten thousand roubles. Raskolnikov refuses the money on her behalf and refuses to facilitate a meeting. Svidrigailov also mentions that his wife, who defended Dunya at the time of the unpleasantness but died shortly afterwards, has left her 3000 rubles in her will.

The meeting with Luzhin that evening begins with talk of Svidrigailov—his depraved character, his presence in Petersburg, the unexpected death of his wife and the 3000 rubles left to Dunya. Luzhin takes offence when Dunya insists on resolving the issue with her brother, and when Raskolnikov draws attention to the slander in his letter, Luzhin becomes reckless, exposing his true character. Dunya tells him to leave and never come back. Now free and with significant capital, they excitedly begin to discuss plans for the future, but Raskolnikov suddenly gets up and leaves, telling them, to their great consternation, that it might be the last time he sees them. He instructs the baffled Razumikhin to remain and always care for them.

Raskolnikov proceeds to Sonya's place. She is gratified that he is visiting her, but also frightened of his strange manner. He asks a series of merciless questions about her terrible situation and that of Katerina Ivanovna and the children. Raskolnikov begins to realize that Sonya is sustained only by her faith in God. She reveals that she was a friend of the murdered Lizaveta. In fact, Lizaveta gave her a cross and a copy of the Gospels. She passionately reads to him the story of the raising of Lazarus from the Gospel of John. His fascination with her, which had begun at the time when her father spoke of her, increases and he decides that they must face the future together. As he leaves he tells her that he will come back tomorrow and tell her who killed her friend Lizaveta.

When Raskolnikov presents himself for his interview, Porfiry resumes and intensifies his insinuating, provocative, ironic chatter, without ever making a direct accusation. With Raskolnikov's anger reaching fever pitch, Porfiry hints that he has a ""little surprise"" for him behind the partition in his office, but at that moment there is a commotion outside the door and a young man (Mikolka the painter) bursts in, followed by some policemen. To both Porfiry and Raskolnikov's astonishment, Mikolka proceeds to loudly confess to the murders. Porfiry does not believe the confession, but he is forced to let Raskolnikov go. Back at his room Raskolnikov is horrified when the old artisan suddenly appears at his door. But the man bows and asks for forgiveness: he had been Porfiry's ""little surprise"", and had heard Mikolka confess. He had been one of those present when Raskolnikov returned to the scene of the murders, and had reported his behavior to Porfiry.

Raskolnikov attends the Marmeladovs' post-funeral banquet at Katerina Ivanovna's apartment. The atmosphere deteriorates as guests become drunk and the half-mad Katerina Ivanovna engages in a verbal attack on her German landlady. With chaos descending, everyone is surprised by the sudden and portentous appearance of Luzhin. He sternly announces that a 100-ruble banknote disappeared from his apartment at the precise time that he was being visited by Sonya, whom he had invited in order to make a small donation. Sonya fearfully denies stealing the money, but Luzhin persists in his accusation and demands that someone search her. Outraged, Katerina Ivanovna abuses Luzhin and sets about emptying Sonya's pockets to prove her innocence, but a folded 100-ruble note does indeed fly out of one of the pockets. The mood in the room turns against Sonya, Luzhin chastises her, and the landlady orders the family out. But Luzhin's roommate Lebezyatnikov arrives, and angrily asserts that he saw Luzhin surreptitiously slip the money into Sonya's pocket as she left, although he had thought at the time that it was a noble act of anonymous charity. Raskolnikov backs Lebezyatnikov up by confidently identifying Luzhin's motive: a desire to avenge himself on Raskolnikov by defaming Sonya, in hopes of causing a rift with his family. Luzhin is discredited, but Sonya is traumatized, and she runs out of the apartment. Raskolnikov follows her.

Back at her room, Raskolnikov draws Sonya's attention to the ease with which Luzhin could have ruined her, and consequently the children as well. But it is only a prelude to his confession that he is the murderer of the old woman and Lizaveta. Painfully, he tries to explain his abstract motives for the crime to uncomprehending Sonya. She is horrified, not just at the crime, but at his own self-torture, and tells him that he must hand himself in to the police. Lebezyatnikov appears and tells them that the landlady has kicked Katerina Ivanovna out of the apartment and that she has gone mad. They find Katerina Ivanovna surrounded by people in the street, completely insane, trying to force the terrified children to perform for money, and near death from her illness. They manage to get her back to Sonya's room, where, distraught and raving, she dies. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Svidrigailov suddenly appears and informs him that he will be using the ten thousand rubles intended for Dunya to make the funeral arrangements and to place the children in good orphanages. When Raskolnikov asks him what his motives are, he laughingly replies with direct quotations of Raskolnikov's own words, spoken when he was trying to explain his justifications for the murder to Sonya. Svidrigailov has been residing next door to Sonya, and overheard every word of the murder confession.

Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that Dunya has become troubled and distant after receiving a letter from someone. He also mentions, to Raskolnikov's astonishment, that Porfiry no longer suspects him of the murders. As Raskolnikov is about to set off in search of Svidrigailov, Porfiry himself appears and politely requests a brief chat. He sincerely apologises for his previous behavior and seeks to explain the reasons behind it. Strangely, Raskolnikov begins to feel alarmed at the thought that Porfiry might think he is innocent. But Porfiry's changed attitude is motivated by genuine respect for Raskolnikov, not by any thought of his innocence, and he concludes by expressing his absolute certainty that Raskolnikov is indeed the murderer. He claims that he will be arresting him soon, but urges him to confess to make it easier on himself. Raskolnikov chooses to continue the struggle.

Raskolnikov finds Svidrigailov at an inn and warns him against approaching Dunya. Svidrigailov, who has in fact arranged to meet Dunya, threatens to go to the police, but Raskolnikov is unconcerned and follows when he leaves. When Raskolnikov finally turns home, Dunya, who has been watching them, approaches Svidrigailov and demands to know what he meant in his letter about her brother's ""secret"". She reluctantly accompanies him to his rooms, where he reveals what he overheard and attempts to use it to make her yield to his desire. Dunya, however, has a gun and she fires at him, narrowly missing: Svidrigailov gently encourages her to reload and try again. Eventually she throws the gun aside, but Svidrigailov, crushed by her hatred for him, tells her to leave. Later that evening he goes to Sonya to discuss the arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna's children. He gives her 3000 rubles, telling her she will need it if she wishes to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. He spends the night in a miserable hotel and the following morning commits suicide in a public place.

Raskolnikov says a painful goodbye to his mother, without telling her the truth. Dunya is waiting for him at his room, and he tells her that he will be going to the police to confess to the murders. He stops at Sonya's place on the way and she gives him a crucifix. At the bureau, he learns of Svidrigailov's suicide, and almost changes his mind, even leaving the building. However, he sees Sonya (who has followed him) looking at him in despair, and he returns to make a full and frank confession to the murders.

Due to the fullness of his confession at a time when another man had already confessed, and his state of mind at the time of the murders, Raskolnikov is sentenced to only eight years of penal servitude. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and plan to move to Siberia, but Raskolnikov's mother falls ill and dies. Sonya follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, but he is initially hostile towards her as he is still struggling to acknowledge moral culpability for his crime, feeling himself to be guilty only of weakness. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence.

InCrime and Punishment, Dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character,Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of ""ideological intoxication,"" and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychological consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov's psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught.[24]From another point of view, the novel's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, ""Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society asHonoré de Balzac'sRastignacorStendhal'sJulien Sorel, but to those of rationalistic Petersburg"".[25]

Raskolnikov(Rodion Romanovitch) is theprotagonist, and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective. A 23-year-old former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov is described in the novel as ""exceptionally handsome, taller than average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair."" On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of impulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it.

Despite its title, the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment as with Raskolnikov's internal struggle – the torments of his own conscience, rather than the legal consequences of committing the crime. Believing society would be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possesses enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.

Sonya(Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova) is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and innocent, despite being forced into prostitution to help her family. Raskolnikov discerns in her the same feelings of shame and alienation that he experiences, and she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime. Sensing his deep unhappiness, she supports him, even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov.

Razumíkhin(Dmitry Prokofyich) is Raskolnikov's loyal friend and also a former law student. The character is intended to represent something of a reconciliation between faith and reason (razum, ""sense"", ""intelligence""). He jokes that his name is actually Vrazumíkhin – a name suggesting ""to bring someone to their senses"".[26]He is upright, strong, resourceful and intelligent, but also somewhat naïve – qualities that are of great importance to Raskolnikov in his desperate situation. He admires Raskolnikov's intelligence and character, refuses to give any credence to others' suspicions, and supports him at all times. He looks after Raskolnikov's family when they come to Petersburg, falling in love with and later marrying Dunya.

Dunya(Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) –  Raskolnikov's beautiful and strong-willed sister who works as a governess. She initially plans to marry the wealthy but unsavory lawyer Luzhin, thinking it will enable her to ease her family's desperate financial situation and escape her former employer Svidrigailov. Her situation is a factor in Raskolnikov's decision to commit the murder. In St. Petersburg, she is eventually able to escape the clutches of both Luzhin and Svidrigailov, and later marries Razumikhin.

Luzhin(Pyotr Petrovich) – A well-off lawyer who is engaged to Dunya in the beginning of the novel. His motives for the marriage are dubious, as he more or less states that he has sought a woman who will be completely beholden to him. He slanders and falsely accuses Sonya of theft in an attempt to harm Raskolnikov's relations with his family. Luzhin represents immorality, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.

Svidrigaïlov(Arkady Ivanovich) – Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and former pursuer of Dunya. He overhears Raskolnikov's confessions to Sonya and uses this knowledge to torment both Dunya and Raskolnikov, but does not inform the police. Despite his apparent malevolence, Svidrigaïlov seems to be capable of generosity and compassion. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go. He tells Sonya that he has made financial arrangements for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage, and gives her three thousand rubles, enabling her to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. Having left the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée, he commits suicide.

Porfiry Petrovich– The head of the Investigation Department in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does this through psychological means, seeking to confuse and provoke the volatile Raskolnikov into a voluntary or involuntary confession. He later drops these methods and sincerely urges Raskolnikov to confess for his own good.

Dostoevsky's letter to Katkov reveals his immediate inspiration, to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into a much more ambitious creation: a desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines ofRussian nihilism.[27]In the novel, Dostoevsky pinpointed the dangers of bothutilitarianismandrationalism, the main ideas of which inspired the radicals, continuing a fierce criticism he had already started with hisNotes from Underground.[28]Dostoevsky utilized the characters, dialogue and narrative inCrime and Punishmentto articulate an argument againstWesternizingideas. He thus attacked a peculiar Russian blend of Frenchutopian socialismandBenthamiteutilitarianism, which had developed under revolutionary thinkers such asNikolai Chernyshevskyand became known asrational egoism.
The radicals refused to recognize themselves in the novel's pages, since Dostoevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences.Dimitri Pisarevridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of the time. The radicals' aims were altruistic and humanitarian, but they were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing the spontaneous outflow of Christian compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.[29]Dostoevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.[30]

Raskolnikov exemplifies the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal. Contemporary scholar Joseph Frank writes that ""the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity on the one hand and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd"".[31]Raskolnikov's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and ""useless"" old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoevsky wants to show that this utilitarian style of reasoning had become widespread and commonplace; it was by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov's tormented and disordered mind.[32]Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov's character, and help justify his contempt for humanity's lower qualities and ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher social good, believes that he possesses a moral right to kill. Indeed, his ""Napoleon-like"" plan impels him toward a well-calculated murder, the ultimate conclusion of his self-deception with utilitarianism.[33]

Dostoevsky was among the first to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regardsCrime and Punishmentas the first great Russian novel ""in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor"".[34]

Dostoevsky's Petersburg is the city of unrelieved poverty; ""magnificence has no place in it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold"". Dostoevsky connects the city's problems to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions.[35]The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that ""the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched.""[36]

In his depiction of Petersburg, Dostoevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov's eyes. He uses Raskolnikov's encounter with Marmeladov to contrast the heartlessness of Raskolnikov's convictions with a Christian approach to poverty and wretchedness.[32]Dostoevsky believes that the moral ""freedom"" propounded by Raskolnikov is a dreadful freedom ""that is contained by no values, because it is before values"". In seeking to affirm this ""freedom"" in himself, Raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God.[37]He thinks that he is self-sufficient and self-contained, but at the end ""his boundless self-confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself, and his self-fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God"".[38]Dostoevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of ""sick"" Russian society through the re-discovery of its national identity, its religion, and its roots.[39]

The novel is divided into six parts, with anepilogue. The notion of ""intrinsic duality"" inCrime and Punishmenthas been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree ofsymmetryto the book.[40]Edward Wasiolek, who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure ofCrime and Punishmentto a ""flattened X"", saying:

This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel's six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as David Bethea has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the ""left"" half of the novel reflects the ""right"" half.[40]

The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky's critics have criticized the novel's final pages as superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy of the rest of the work,[42]while others have defended it, offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues thatCrime and Punishment""is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale"".[43]Cassedy concludes that ""the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue inCrime and Punishment... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue"".[44]

Crime and Punishmentis written from athird-personomniscient perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov, but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as Svidrigaïlov, Razumikhin, Luzhin, Sonya or Dunya. This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters, was original for its period. Frank notes that Dostoevsky's use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments ofHenry James,Joseph Conrad,Virginia Woolf, andJames Joyce. A late nineteenth-century reader was, however, accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration. This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman, and to observations like the following byMelchior de Vogüé: ""A word ... one does not even notice, a small fact that takes up only a line, have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [so that] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages"".[45]

Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters. Those who use artificial language—Luzhin, for example—are identified as unattractive people. Mrs. Marmeladov's disintegrating mind is reflected in her language. In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters have something of adouble meaning, but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture. For example, the original Russian title (""Преступление и наказание"") is not the direct equivalent to the English ""Crime and Punishment"". ""Преступление"" (Prestupléniye) is literally translated as 'a stepping across'. The physical image of crime as crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation, as is the religious implication of transgression.[46]

The first part ofCrime and Punishmentpublished in the January and February issues ofThe Russian Messengermet with public success. In his memoirs, the conservative belletristNikolay Strakhovrecalled thatCrime and Punishmentwas the literary sensation of 1866 in Russia.[47]Tolstoy's novelWar and Peacewas being serialized inThe Russian Messengerat the same time asCrime and Punishment.

The novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations, and wondered, ""Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?"" Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value, described Raskolnikov as a product of his environment, and argued that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy with which Dostoevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: ""This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it.""[48][49]Solovyov felt that the meaning of the novel, despite the common failure to understand it, is clear and simple: a man who considers himself entitled to 'step across' discovers that what he thought was an intellectually and even morally justifiable transgression of an arbitrary law turns out to be, for his conscience, ""a sin, a violation of inner moral justice... that inward sin of self-idolatry can only be redeemed by an inner act of self-renunciation.""[50]

The earlySymbolistmovement that dominated Russian letters in the 1880s was concerned more with aesthetics than the visceral realism and intellectuality ofCrime and Punishment, but a tendency toward mysticism among the new generation of symbolists in the 1900s led to a reevaluation of the novel as an address to the dialectic of spirit and matter.[51]In the character of Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna) they saw an embodiment of both the Orthodox feminine principle ofhagia sophia(holy wisdom) – ""at once sexual and innocent, redemptive both in her suffering and her veneration of suffering"", and the most important feminine deity of Russian folkloremat syra zemlya(moist mother earth).[52]Raskolnikov is a ""son of Earth"" whose egoistic aspirations lead him to ideas and actions that alienate him from the very source of his strength, and he must bow down to her before she can relieve him of the terrible burden of his guilt.[53][54]Philosopher and Orthodox theologianNikolay Berdyaevshared Solovyov and the symbolists' sense of the novel's spiritual significance, seeing it as an illustration of the modern age's hubristic self-deification, or what he calls ""the suicide of man by self-affirmation"". Raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will, but, according to Berdyaev, these are questions that can only be answered by God, and ""he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself: that is the meaning ofCrime and Punishment"".[55][56]

Crime and Punishmentwas regarded as an important work in a number of 20th-century European cultural movements, notably theBloomsbury Group,psychoanalysis, andexistentialism. Of the writers associated with Bloomsbury,Virginia Woolf,John Middleton MurryandD. H. Lawrenceare some of those who have discussed the work.Freudheld Dostoevsky's work in high esteem, and many of his followers have attempted psychoanalytical interpretations of Raskolnikov.[57]Among the existentialists,SartreandCamusin particular have acknowledged Dostoevsky's influence.[58]

The affinity ofCrime and Punishmentwith both religious mysticism and psychoanalysis led to suppression of discussion inSovietRussia: interpretations of Raskolnikov tended to align with Pisarev's idea of reaction to unjust socio-economic conditions.[59]An exception was the work ofMikhail Bakhtin, considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of Dostoevsky's work. InProblems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, Bakhtin argues that attempts to understand Dostoevsky's characters from the vantage point of a pre-existing philosophy, or as individualized ""objects"" to be psychologically analysed, will always fail to penetrate the unique ""artistic architechtonics"" of his works.[60]In such cases, both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are monological: everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of a single overarching perspective, whether that of the critic or that of the author. Dostoevsky's art, Bakhtin argues, is inherently dialogical: events proceed on the basis of interaction between self-validating subjective voices, often within the consciousness of an individual character, as is the case with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov's consciousness is depicted as a battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel: everyone and everything he encounters becomes reflected and refracted in a ""dialogized"" interior monologue.[61]He has rejected external relationships and chosen his tormenting internal dialogue; only Sonya is capable of continuing to engage with him despite his cruelty. His openness to dialogue with Sonya is what enables him to cross back over the ""threshold into real-life communication (confession and public trial)—not out of guilt, for he avoids acknowledging his guilt, but out of weariness and loneliness, for that reconciling step is the only relief possible from the cacophony of unfinalized inner dialogue.""[62]

The Garnett translation was the dominant translation for more than 80 years after its publication in 1914. Since the 1990s, McDuff and Pevear/Volokhonsky have become its major competitors.[63]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47935,Fathers and Sons,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_and_Sons_(novel),"University graduate Arkady Kirsanov returns to his father's modest estate, called Marino. Arkady brings his friend, Yevgeny Bazarov. His father, Nikolay, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, but Nikolay's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called ""nihilism"" that the young men advocate.

Nikolay, initially delighted to have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy. A certain awkwardness develops in his regard toward his son, as Arkady's radical views, much influenced by Bazarov, make Nikolay's own beliefs feel dated. Nikolay has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they can, but this in Nikolay's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house to live with him and has already had a son by her, named Mitya. Arkady, however, is not troubled by the relationship; on the contrary, he is delighted by the addition of a younger brother.

The two young men stay at Marino for some weeks, then decide to visit a relative of Arkady's. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from conventional types of the local provincial society. Both are greatly attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov's singular manner, invites them to spend a few days at her estate, Nikolskoye.

At Nikolskoye, they also meet Katya, Madame Odintsova's sister. Although they stay for just a short time, Arkady steadily becomes more independent of Bazarov's influence. Bazarov finds falling in love distressing because it runs counter to his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Madame Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond positively to his declaration; she finds his devaluation of feelings and of the aesthetic side of existence unattractive. She does not see the possibility of a good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady goes with him.

At Bazarov's home, they are received enthusiastically by his parents, who adore him. Bazarov's social cynicism is still on display as he settles back into his own family's home again. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov and Arkady nearly come to blows after Bazarov speaks insultingly of Arkady's uncle and chides Arkady for expressing himself too romantically. Arkady becomes more openly skeptical of Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Marino, stopping on the way to see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. Embarrassed, they leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.

Arkady remains for only a few days and makes an excuse to leave in order to go to Nikolskoye again. Once there, he realizes he is not in love with Odintsova, but instead with her sister Katya. Bazarov stays at Marino to do some scientific research, and tension between him and Pavel increases. Bazarov enjoys talking with Fenechka and playing with her child, and one day he kisses her, against her will. Pavel observes this kiss and challenges Bazarov to a duel. Pavel is wounded in the leg, and Bazarov must leave Marino, going to his parents' home. Meanwhile, Arkady and Katya have fallen in love and have become engaged.

While back at home, Bazarov begins to help his father as a country doctor. He cannot keep his mind on his work, though, and while performing an autopsy, he cuts himself and becomes infected. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in time to hear Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves; Bazarov dies the following day.

Arkady marries Katya and assumes the management of his father's estate. His father marries Fenechka and is delighted to have Arkady home with him. The novel closes with a scene of Bazarov's parents praying by his graveside.

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6157,"What Men Live By, and Other Tales",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Men_Live_By,"A kind, humble and poorshoemakernamed Simon goes out one day to purchase sheep-skins in order to sew a winter coat for his wife and himself to share.  Usually, the little money which Simon earns would be spent to purchase food for his family. However, Simon decides that in order to afford the skins he must go on a collection to receive the fiverublesand twenty kopeks owed to him by his customers.  As he heads out to collect the money he also borrows a three-rouble note from his wife's money box.  While going on his collection he only manages to collect the twenty kopeks rather than the full amount.  Feeling disheartened by this, Simon rashly spends the twenty kopeks onvodkaand starts to head back home drunkenly, stumbling and talking to himself, cursing the coat dealer. He states that he is warm without the vodka and that he won't make it through the winter without a fur coat.

While approaching the chapel at the end of the road, Simon stops and notices something pale-looking leaning against it.  He looks closer and notices that it is a naked man who appears poor of health. Initially, he is suspicious and fears that the man may have bad intentions if he is in such a state, assuming Simon to be a drunkard. He proceeds to pass the man until he sees that the man has lifted his head and is looking towards him.  After some contemplation, Simon feels ashamed for his disregard and heads back to help the man.

Simon takes off his cloth coat and wraps it around the stranger.  He also gives him the extra pair of boots he was carrying.  He aids him as they both walk toward Simon's home.  Though they walk together side by side, the stranger barely speaks and when Simon asks how he was left in that situation the only answers the man would give are: ""I cannot tell"" and ""God has punished me.""  Meanwhile, Simon's wife Matryona contemplates whether or not to bake more bread for the night's meal so that there is enough for the following morning's breakfast.  She decides that the loaf of bread that they have left would be ample enough to last until the next morning.  As she sees Simon approaching the door she is angered to see him with a strange man who is wrapped in Simon's clothing.

Matryona immediately expresses her displeasure with Simon, accusing them both to be drunkards and harassing Simon for not returning with the sheep-skin needed to make a new coat. Once the tension settles down, she bids that the stranger sit down and have dinner with them. After seeing the stranger take bites at the bread she placed for him on his plate, she begins to feel pity and shows so in her face. When the stranger notices this, his grim expression lights up immediately and he smiles for one brief moment.  After hearing the stranger's story of Simon's kind behavior towards him, Matryona grabs more of Simon's old clothing and gives it to the stranger.

The following morning Simon addresses the stranger and asks his name. The stranger reveals his name to be Michael. Simon explains to Michael that he can stay in his household as long as he can earn his keep by working as an assistant for Simon in his shoemaking business. Michael agrees to these terms and for a few years he remains a very faithful assistant.

One winter day a nobleman comes in their shop. The nobleman outlines strict conditions for the construction of a pair of thick leather boots: they should not lose shape nor become loose at the seams for a year, or else he would have Simon arrested. When Simon gives to Michael the leather that the nobleman had given them to use, Michael appears to stare beyond the nobleman's shoulder and smiles for the second time since he has been there. As Michael cuts and sews the leather, instead of making thick leather boots, he makes a pair of soft leather slippers. Simon is too late when he notices this and cries to Michael asking why he would do such a foolish thing. Before Michael can answer, a messenger arrives at their door and gives the news that the nobleman has died and asks if they could change the order to slippers for him to wear on his death bed. Simon is astounded by this and watches as Michael gives the messenger the already-made leather slippers. Time continues to go by and Simon is very grateful for Michael's faithful assistance.

In the sixth year, another customer comes in who happens to be a woman with two girls, one of whom is crippled. The woman requests if she could order a pair of leather shoes for each of the girls — three shoes of the same size, since they both share the same shoe size, and another shoe for the crippled girl's lame foot. As they are preparing to fill the order Michael stares intently at the girls and Simon wonders why he is doing so.  As Simon takes the girls' measurements he asks the woman if they are her own children and how was the girl with the lame foot crippled. The woman explains that she has no relation to them and that the actual mother on her deathbed accidentally crushed the leg of the crippled girl. She expresses that she could not find it in her heart to leave them in a safe home or orphanage andadoptedthem as her own. When Michael hears this, he smiles for the third time since he has been there.

After the woman and the two children finally left, Michael approaches Simon and bids him farewell explaining that God has finally forgiven him. As Michael does this he begins to be surrounded by a heavenly glow and Simon acknowledges that he is not an ordinary man.  Simon asks him why light emits from him and why did he smile only those three times. Michael explains that he is anangelwho was given the task to take away a woman's life so she could pass on to the next life.  He allowed the woman to live because she begged that she must take care of her children for no one other than their mother could care for them. When he did this God punished him for his disobedience and commanded that he must find the answers to the following questions in order to be an angel again:What dwells in man?,What is not given to man?, andWhat do men live by?After Michael returned to earth to take the woman's soul, the woman's lifeless body rolled over and crushed the leg of the now crippled girl.  Then Michael's wings left him and he became a naked and mortal man.  When Simon rescued him he knew that he must start finding the answers to those questions. He learned the answer to the first question when Matryona felt pity for him, thus smiling and realizing that what dwells in man is ""love"".  The answer to the second question came to him when he realized that the angel of death was looming over the nobleman who was making preparations for a year though he would not live till sunset; thus Michael smiled, realizing that what is not given to man is ""to know his own needs.""  Lastly, he comprehended the answer to the final question when he saw the woman with the two girls from the mother, whose soul he previously did not take, thus smiling and realizing that regardless of being a stranger or a relation to each other, ""all men live not by care for themselves but by love.""  Michael concludes, saying, ""I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by care for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live.  He who has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love.""  When Michael finishes, he sings praises to God as wings appear on his back and he rises to return toheaven.

It was turned into a short British film in 1938 directed byVernon Sewell.[2]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/65662,Der Zauberberg. Zweiter Band (German),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain,"The narrative opens in the decade beforeWorld War I. It introduces the protagonist, Hans Castorp, the only child of aHamburgmerchant family. Following the early death of his parents, Castorp was brought up by his grandfather and, later, by a maternal uncle named James Tienappel. Castorp is in his early 20s and is about to take up a shipbuilding career in Hamburg, his hometown. Before beginning work, he undertakes a journey to visit his tubercular cousin, Joachim Ziemssen, who is seeking a cure in asanatoriuminDavos, high up in theSwiss Alps. In the opening chapter, Castorp leaves his familiar life and obligations, in what he later learns to call ""the flatlands"", to visit the rarefied mountain air and introspective small world of the sanatorium.

Castorp's departure from the sanatorium is repeatedly delayed by his failing health. What at first appears to be a minor bronchial infection with a slight fever, is later diagnosed by the sanatorium's chief doctor and director, Hofrat[a]Behrens, as symptoms oftuberculosis.[6]Castorp is persuaded by Behrens to stay until his health improves.

During his extended stay, Castorp meets various characters, who represent pre-war Europe in miniature. These include Lodovico Settembrini, an Italianhumanist, encyclopedist, and student ofGiosuè Carducci, Leo Naphta, a JewishJesuitwho favors communist totalitarianism, Mynheer Peeperkorn, adionysianDutchman, and his romantic interest, Madame Clawdia Chauchat.

Castorp eventually resides at the sanatorium for seven years. As the novel concludes, the war begins, and Castorp volunteers for the military. His possible demise upon the battlefield is portended.

The Magic Mountaincan be interpreted as both a classic example of the EuropeanBildungsroman– a ""novel of education"" or ""novel of formation"" – and as a satire of this genre. Many formal characteristics of theBildungsromanare present: the protagonist begins in a state of immaturity and, through leaving his home environment, is exposed to art, culture, politics, human vulnerability, and love.[citation needed]

The novel incorporates reflections on topics such as the experience of time, music, nationalism, sociology, and changes in the natural world. Through Castorp's stay in the rarefied atmosphere of ""The Magic Mountain"", the narrative offers a panoramic view of pre-World War I European civilisation and its underlying tensions.[citation needed].

Mann describes the subjective experience of serious illness and the gradual process of medical institutionalisation. He also alludes to the irrational forces within the human psyche, at a time whenFreudianpsychoanalysis was becoming a prominent type of treatment. These themes relate to the development of Castorp's character over the period covered by the novel. In his discussion of the work, written in English and published inThe Atlanticin January 1953, Mann states that ""what [Hans] came to understand is that one must go through the deep experience of sickness and death to arrive at a higher sanity and health...""[7].

Mann also acknowledged his debt to the skeptical insights ofFriedrich Nietzscheconcerning modern humanity, and he drew from these in creating conversations between the characters.[8]Throughout the book, the author employs the discussions among Settembrini, Naphta, and the medical staff to introduce the young Castorp to a wide spectrum of competing ideologies about responses to theAge of Enlightenment. However, a classicalBildungsromanwould conclude by Castorp's having become a mature member of society[citation needed], with his own worldview and greater self-knowledge, whileThe Magic Mountainends with Castorp's becoming one of millions of anonymous conscripts under fire on a World War I battlefield.

Mann wrote that he originally plannedThe Magic Mountainas anovella, a humorous, ironic, satirical follow-up toDeath in Venice, which he had completed in 1912. The atmosphere was derived from the ""mixture of death and amusement"" that Mann had encountered while visiting his wife in a Swisssanatorium. He intended to transfer to a comedic plane the fascination with death and triumph of ecstatic disorder over a life devoted to order, which he had explored inDeath in Venice.[citation needed]

The atmosphere and the character's journey inThe Magic Mountaincontrast considerably with the earlier novella. Whereas the protagonist of the novella was the mature and acclaimed author Gustav von Aschenbach, the central figure is now a callow young engineer at the outset of an anticipated career. The alluring Polish adolescent Tadzio in the novella corresponds to the Asiatic-flabby (""asiatisch-schlaff"") Russian Madame Chauchat. The setting has shifted from the densely populated island city on theAdriaticcoast to an alpine, quasi-resort-like sanatorium prized for its (alleged) health-restoring properties.

TheBerghofpatients suffer from some form of tuberculosis, which dictates their daily routines, thoughts, and conversations as members of the ""Half-Lung Cub"" (""Verein Halbe Lunge""). The disease ends fatally for many of the patients, such as the Catholic girl Barbara Hujus, whose fear of death is heightened in chapter III in a harrowingViaticumscene, and cousin Ziemssen, who dies like an ancient hero. The dialogues between Settembrini and Naphta examine life and death from a metaphysical perspective. Besides the deaths from fatal illness, two characters commit suicide, and finally Castorp goes off to fight in World War I, and it is implied that he will be killed on the battlefield.

In the above-mentioned comment, Mann writes:

The treatment of time (Zeit) is a major narrative and philosophical concern in the novel.[9]The novel's structure reflects this through its asymmetrical handling of chronology: the first five chapters (approximately half the novel) detail only the initial year of Castorp's stay, while the final two chapters compress the remaining six years.[10]

Mann addresses time both as a narrative device and a philosophical concept. Chapter VII, titled ""By the Ocean of Time,"" opens with the narrator directly questioning the possibility of narrating time itself.[11]The characters frequently discuss theories of time perception, debating whether time passes more quickly or slowly depending on circumstance and routine.[12]

Contemporary philosophical discussions of time, particularlyHenri Bergson's concepts of duration and subjective time experience, informed Mann's approach.[13]This influence is evident in the novel's exploration of how time appears to accelerate or decelerate based on the characters' experiences in the sanatorium setting.[14]

The Magic Mountain, in essence, embodies the author's meditations on thetempoof experience.

The narrative is ordered chronologically but accelerates throughout the novel so that the first five chapters (approximately half of the text) relate the first of Castorp's seven years at the sanatorium in great detail; the remaining six years, marked by monotony and routine, are described in the last two chapters. This asymmetry corresponds to Castorp's own skewed perception of the passage of time.

This structure reflects the protagonist's thoughts. Throughout the book, they discuss thephilosophy of timeand debate whether ""interest and novelty dispel or shorten the content of time, while monotony and emptiness hinder its passage"".  The characters also reflect on the problems ofnarrationand time,  about the correspondence between the length of a narrative and the duration of the events it describes.

Mann also meditates upon the interrelationship between the experience of time and space; of time seeming to pass more slowly when one does not move in space. This aspect of the novel mirrors contemporary philosophical and scientific debates which are embodied inHeidegger'swritings andAlbert Einstein'stheory of relativity, in which space and time are inseparable. In essence, Castorp's subtly transformed perspective on the ""flat-lands"" corresponds to a movement in time.

The titular reference to 'mountain' reappears in many layers. TheBerghofsanatorium is located on a mountain, both geographically and figuratively, a separate world. The mountain also represents the opposite of Castorp's home, the sober, businesslike ""flatland"".

The first part of the novel culminates and ends in the sanatoriumCarnivalfeast. There, in a grotesque scene named afterWalpurgis Night, the setting is transformed into theBlocksberg, where according to German tradition, witches and wizards meet in obscene revelry. This is also described inGoethe'sFaust I. At this event, Castorp woos Madame Chauchat; their subtle conversation is carried on almost wholly in French.

AnothertoposofGerman literatureis theVenus Mountain(Venusberg), which is referred to inRichard Wagner's operaTannhäuser. This mountain is a ""hellish paradise"", a place of lust and abandon, where time flows differently: the visitor loses all sense of time. Castorp, who planned to stay at the sanatorium for three weeks, does not leave theBerghoffor seven years.

In general, the inhabitants of theBerghofspend their days in a mythical, distant atmosphere. The X-ray laboratory in the cellar represents theHadesof Greek mythology, where Medical Director Behrens acts as the judge and punisherRhadamanthysand where Castorp is a fleeting visitor, likeOdysseus. Behrens compares the cousins toCastorandPollux; Settembrini compares himself toPrometheus. Frau Stöhr mentionsSisyphusandTantalus, albeit confusedly.

The culmination of the second part of the novel is perhaps the – still ""episodic"" – chapter of Castorp's blizzard dream (in the novel simply called ""Snow""). The protagonist gets into a suddenblizzard, beginning a death-bound sleep, dreaming at first of beautiful meadows with blossoms and of lovable young people at a southern seaside; then of a scene reminiscent of a grotesque event in Goethe'sFaust I(""the witches' kitchen"", again in Goethe's ""Blocksberg chapter""); and finally ending with a dream of extreme cruelty – the slaughtering of a child by two witches, priests of a classic temple. According to Mann, this represents the original and deathly destructive force of nature itself.

Castorp awakens in due time, escapes from the blizzard, and returns to theBerghof. But rethinking his dreams, he concludes that ""because of charity and love, man should never allow death to rule one's thoughts"". Castorp soon forgets this sentence, so for him, the blizzard event remains an interlude. This is the only sentence in the novel that Mann highlighted in italics.

There are frequent references toGrimms' Fairy Tales, based on European myths. The opulent meals are compared to the magically self-laying table of ""Table, Donkey, and Stick""; Frau Engelhardt's quest to learn the first name of Madame Chauchat mirrors that of the queen in ""Rumpelstiltskin"". Castorp's given name is the same as ""Clever Hans"". Although the ending is not explicit, it is possible that Castorp dies on the battlefield. Mann leaves his fate unresolved.

Mann makes use of the number seven, often believed to have magical qualities: Castorp was seven when his parents died; he stays seven years at theBerghof, from the years 1907 to 1914; the central Walpurgis Night scene happens after seven months, both cousins have seven letters in their last name, the dining hall has seven tables, Madame Chauchat is initially assigned room number 7, the digits of Castorp's room number (34) add up to seven, and Joachim's room is a multiple of seven (28=7×4). Settembrini's name includes 'seven' (sette) in Italian, Joachim keeps a thermometer in his mouth for seven minutes, and Mynheer Peeperkorn announces his suicide in a group of seven. Joachim decides to leave after a stay of seven times seventy days and dies at seven o'clock. The novel itself, moreover, is divided into seven chapters.

Mann gives a central role to music in this novel. People at theBerghoflisten to ""Der Lindenbaum"" from theWinterreiseplayed on a gramophone. This piece is full of mourning in the view of death and hints at an invitation to suicide. In the book's final scene, Castorp, now an ordinary soldier on Germany's western front in World War I, hums the song to himself as his unit advances in battle.

Mann uses the novel's main characters to introduce Castorp to the ideas and ideologies of his time. The author observed that the characters are all ""exponents, representatives, and messengers of intellectual districts, principles, and worlds,"" hoping that he had not made them mere wandering allegories.

According to Mann, the protagonist is a questing knight, the ""pure fool"" looking for theHoly Grailin the tradition ofParzival. However, he remains pale and mediocre, representing a German bourgeois that is torn between conflicting influences – capable of the highest humanistic ideals, yet at the same time prone to both stubbornphilistinismand radical ideologies. As usual, Mann chooses his protagonist's name carefully: 'Hans' is a generic German first name, almost anonymous, but also refers to the fairy tale figure of ""Hans im Glück"" and the apostleSt. John(Johannes in German), the favourite disciple of Jesus, who beholds theRevelation(Offenbarung des Johannesin German). Castorp is the name of a historically prominent family in Mann's hometown,Lübeck, which provided at least three generations of Mayors for the town in the era of the Renaissance. The ""torp"" is Danish, not unexpected on the German north coast. Castorp also refers to the twinsCastor and Polluxin Greek mythology, who were identified by the New Testament scholarDennis MacDonaldas models for the apostlesJamesand John.

In a way, Hans Castorp can be seen as the incorporation of the youngWeimar Republic. Humanism and radicalism, represented by Settembrini and Naphta, try to win his favour, but Castorp is unable to decide. His body temperature is a subtle metaphor for his lack of clarity: FollowingSchiller’s theory of fever, Castorp’s temperature is 37.6 °C (99.7 °F), which is neither healthy nor ill, but an intermediate point. Furthermore, the outside temperature in Castorp's residence is out of balance: it is either too warm or too cold and tends to extremes (e.g. snow in August), but never normal. According toChristian Kracht, ""Hans Castorp experienced the elevation of his temperature as lifting him to an elevated state of being.""[15]

The most pronounced instance of Thomas Mann's political conversion is in the ""Schnee"" (snow) chapter. Completed in June 1923, this chapter, which forms the philosophical heart of the novel, attempts to overcome apparent contrasts and find a compromise between Naphta's and Settembrini's positions. In the chapter ""Humaniora"", written in 1920, Castorp tells Behrens, in a discussion on medical matters, that an interest in life means an interest in death. In the ""Schnee"" chapter, Castorp comes to exactly the opposite conclusion. The basis for Castorp's contradiction can be found in the speech ""On the German Republic"" (Von Deutscher Republic), written in the previous year, in which Mann outlines his position with regards to the precedence of life and humanity over death. Even though Castorp could not possibly have learned from either Naphta or Settembrini the idea that the experience of death is ultimately that of life and leads to a new appreciation of humanity, Mann was determined from at least September 1922 onwards to make this message the main point of his novel. In a letter of 4 September 1922 toArthur Schnitzler, Mann refers to ""Von deutscher Republik"", in which, he says, he is endeavouring to win the German middle classes over to the cause of the Republic and humanitarian concerns, and adds that his new-found passion for humanitarianism is closely related to the novel on which he is working. In the climax of the ""Schnee"" chapter, Castorp's vision is of the triumph of life, love, and human concern over sickness and death. This realisation corresponds closely to Mann's key observation in ""Von deutscher Republik"". As if to dispel any lingering doubts, Mann makes the meaning absolutely clear in his ""Tischrede in Amsterdam"" [Dinner speech in Amsterdam], held on 3 May 1924. Death stands for the ultra-conservative opponents of the Republic, while life embodies the supporters of democracy, the only way to guarantee a humanitarian future. The ""Schnee"" chapter was written in the first half of 1923 and the italicisation of the key sentence was probably requested by Mann when the book was set in print in 1924, as a message to the readers of the time, who, after years of hyper-inflation and political turmoil, not only expected but also desperately needed a positive direction to their lives, some words of wisdom which would give them hope.[5]



Settembrini represents the active and positive ideal ofThe Enlightenment, ofHumanism,democracy,toleranceandhuman rights. He often finds Castorp literally in the dark and switches on the light before their conversations. He compares himself to Prometheus of Greek mythology, who brought fire and enlightenment to Man. His own mentor Giosuè Carducci has even written a hymn to another lightbringer:Lucifer, ""la forza vindice della ragione."" His ethics are based on bourgeois values and labor. He tries to counter Castorp's morbid fascination with death and disease, warns him against the ill Madame Chauchat, and tries to demonstrate a positive outlook on life.

His antagonist Naphta describes him as ""Zivilisationsliterat"", meaning cosmopolitan, un-German intellectuals. Mann originally constructed Settembrini as a caricature of the liberal-democratic novelist represented, for example, by his own brotherHeinrich Mann. However, while the novel was being written, Mann himself became an outspoken supporter of the Weimar Republic, precipitated by the assassination of then German Foreign MinisterWalther Rathenauwhom Mann deeply admired, which may explain why Settembrini, especially in the later chapters, becomes the ""Sprachrohr des Autoren"" (the voice of the author).[5]

Settembrini's antagonist Naphta was Jewish but joined theJesuitsand became a Hegelian Marxist. The character was a parody of the philosopherGeorg Lukács, who ""plainly has not recognized himself in Naphta"", wrote Mann in a 1949 letter.[16]

Even here a change in Mann's political stance can be seen. In ""Operationes spirituales"" from Chapter VI, written towards the end of 1922, Naphta is termed a ""revolutionary"" and ""socialist"", but Settembrini sees Naphta's fantasies as emanating from an anti-humanitarian reactionary revolution (""Revolution des antihumanen Rückschlages""). In this chapter, the terrorism championed by Naphta is no longer, in Castorp's eyes, associated solely with the ""Diktatur des Proletariats"", but also with conservative Prussian militarism and Jesuitism. The association here between Naphta's advocacy of terrorism and two extremely conservative movements – Prussian militarism and Jesuitism – is a huge political shift for the novel. Terrorism, up till now exclusively the province of the communist revolution, is now suddenly also an instrument of reactionary conservatism. In a clear allusion on Mann's part to the assassination ofWalther Rathenau, Naphta goes into the motivation of the revolutionary who killed Councillor of StateAugust von Kotzebuein 1819, and concludes that it was not just the desire for freedom at stake here but also moral fanaticism and political outrage. That this is a direct reference to the death of Rathenau is borne out by the fact that in the first edition Mann refers to the shooting of Kotzebue, whereas he was in fact stabbed. Alerted to this mistake by Max Rieger, Mann replied on 1 September 1925 that he would rectify the error at the first opportunity. Mann changed the wordgeschossentoerstochenfor future editions. For the 1924 readership, however, the association with Rathenau could not have been clearer.[5]

Clawdia Chauchat represents erotic temptation, lust, and love, all in a degenerate, morbid, ""Asiatic-flabby"" form. She is one of the major reasons for Castorp's extended stay on the magic mountain. The female promise of sensual pleasure as a hindrance to male zest for action imitates the themes from theCircemythos and in the nymphs in Wagner'sVenus Mountain. Chauchat's feline characteristics are noted often, her last name is derived from the Frenchchaud chat[hot cat], and her first name includes the English 'claw'. (Her name may also be a reference to theChauchatmachine gun,
a French weapon that saw significant use by the French and American forces during World War I.) Chauchat could also be a play on words with 'chaud' [hot] and 'chatte' [female genitalia] in French slang.

Clawdia Chauchat leaves theBerghoffor some time, but she returns with an impressive companion, Mynheer Peeperkorn, who suffers from a tropical disease.

Mynheer Peeperkorn, Clawdia Chauchat's new lover, enters theBerghofscenery late, but he is one of the most commanding persons in the novel. His behavior and personality, with its flavour of importance, combined with obvious awkwardness and the strange inability ever to complete a statement, is reminiscent of certain figures in former novellas of the author (e.g. Herr Klöterjahn inTristan) – figures, which are, on the one hand, admired because of their vital energy, and, on the other hand, condemned because of their naïveté. In total, this person represents the grotesqueness of aDionysiancharacter. The Greek godDionysusis also important inNietzschean philosophy, whoseThe Birth of Tragedyis the source of the titleThe Magic Mountain.[17]

Peeperkorn ends his life by suicide, also performed in a strange manner.

Mynheer Peeperkorn was used by the author to personify his rival, the influential German poetGerhart Hauptmann,[18]and even certain aspects of Goethe (with whom Hauptmann often was compared). ""One scholar has postulated that the character of Mynheer Peeperkorn ... who revels in lavish meals ... was intended as a mirror image ofKafka'shunger artist....""[19]

Joachim Ziemssen, Hans Castorp's cousin, is described as a young person representing the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness as an officer. As already mentioned, Dr. Behrens alludes to the pair as ""Castor(p) and Pollux"", the twin brothers of Greek mythology. And in fact, there is some affinity between the two cousins, both in their love to Russian women (Clawdia Chauchat in the case of Hans Castorp, the female co-patient ""Marusja"" in the case of Joachim Ziemssen), and also in their ideals. But, in contrast to Hans Castorp, who is an assertive person on theBerghofscene, Joachim Ziemssen is rather shy, known to stand somehow outside of the community. He tries to escape from what he, unspokenly, feels to be a morbid atmosphere. After long discussions with his cousin, and in spite of being warned by Dr. Behrens, he returns to the ""flatlands"", where he fulfills his military duties for some time. But after a while, forced by deterioration of his lungs, he returns to theBerghof. It is, however, too late for a successful treatment of his illness, and he dies in the sanitarium. His death is described in a moving chapter of the novel, with the title ""As a soldier, and a good one"" [(Ich sterbe) als Soldat und brav], again a well-known citation fromGoethe'sFaust.

The Magic Mountainis mentioned in the filmThe Wind Rises(2013), directed byHayao Miyazaki, by a German character named Hans Castorp.[20]

Nobel LaureateCzesław Miłoszborrowed[citation needed]the title for his poem, ""A Magic Mountain"".[21]

The novel is mentioned inThe Dick Van Dyke Showepisode ""That's My Boy??"" (season 3, episode 1). With all the mix-ups at the hospital between the Petries and the Peters, and each getting the other's stuff, Rob is trying to determine if he and Laura brought home the right baby, so he goes to check the baby's footprints, which he tells his neighbor are kept inThe Magic Mountain. ""Huh?"" says Jerry. ""The book"", says Rob. Jerry finds the footprints and reads the book's title, ""Oh, Thomas Mann"", and then they cover the kid's foot with blue ink.[22]

The 2016 psychological horror filmA Cure for Wellnesswas inspired by Mann's novel.[23]

The Empusium: A Health Resort Horror Story, the 2022 novel byNobel PrizelaureateOlga Tokarczuk, is said to be ""part homage and part rejoinder"" toThe Magic Mountain.[24]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75011,All quiet on the Western Front,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front,"The book centers on Paul Bäumer, a German soldier on the Western Front during World War I. Before the war, Paul lived with his parents and sister in a charming German village. He attended school, where the patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek led the whole class to volunteer for theImperial German Armyshortly after the start of theGreat War. At the training camp, where they meet Himmelstoß, his class is scattered over the platoons amongstFrisianfishermen, peasants and labourers, with whom they soon become friends. Bäumer arrives at the Western Front with his friends and schoolmates (Albert, Kemmerich, Leer, Müller, and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older recalled reservist, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor.

While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions oftrench warfare. The battles fought here have no names and only meager pieces of land are gained, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken.

Paul visits home, and the contrast with civilian life highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war, but he has: he finds that he does ""not belong here any more, it is a foreign world"". Paul recovers the books and writings he had left in his childhood room, but finds his passion for literature to have been completely erased by the trauma of war. He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople, who ask him ""stupid and distressing"" questions about his experiences or lecture him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their ""own little sector"" but nothing of the big picture. Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender yet restrained relationship. In the end, he concludes that he ""ought never to have come [home] on leave"".

Paul is glad to return and reunite with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a Frenchman in hand-to-hand combat for the first time. He watches the man die slowly in agony for hours. He is remorseful and devastated, asking for forgiveness from the man's corpse. He later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war. Paul and his company receive a temporary reprieve from the horrid rations and living conditions of the trenches when they are instead sent to a supply depot in an occupied French town. They enjoy food and luxuries taken from the depot or looted from the town but continue to lose men to Allied shelling, culminating in Paul and Albert being wounded while evacuating civilians and needing to be diverted to aCatholic hospitalfar behind the lines. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, whilst Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.

By the closing months of the war, German morale is almost nonexistent as the men realize they are only fighting to delay an armistice. The Americans have recently joined the war as both they and the English begin outperforming the far more poorly equipped Germans. In despair Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. Kat's death is the last straw that finally causes Paul to lose his will to live. In the final chapter he comments that peace is coming soon but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.

In October 1918 Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: ""All quiet on the Western Front."" Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, ""as though almost glad the end had come."""
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289,The Valley of Fear,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Fear,"Sherlock Holmesreceives aciphermessage from Fred Porlock, a pseudonymous agent ofProfessor Moriarty. Holmes deciphers the message as a warning of a nefarious plot against a man surnamed Douglas, a country gentleman residing at Birlstone House. Some minutes later, Inspector MacDonald arrives at221B Baker Streetwith news that Douglas was murdered the night before. MacDonald, Holmes, and Watson travel to Birlstone House to investigate.

Birlstone House is surrounded by a shallow moat, which the murderer appears to have crossed as they fled the crime scene. After interviewing Cecil Barker, a frequent guest at Birlstone House who discovered the body, they agree that suicide is out of the question and that someone from outside the house committed the murder. Barker explains that Douglas married after arriving in England five years earlier. Barker believes asecret societyof men pursued Douglas, and that he retreated to rural England out of fear for his life. Mrs. Douglas said her husband mentioned something called ""The Valley of Fear"". Holmes learns that the housekeeper heard a sound, as if of a door slamming, half an hour before the alarm; Holmes believes that this sound was the fatal shot.

Local detective White Mason and Inspector MacDonald track a bicycle found on the grounds of the house to an American staying at a guest house. The American appears to be the murderer, but there is no sign of him. Holmes asks MacDonald to write to Barker, telling him that the police intend to search the moat the next day. That night, they lie in wait outside Birlstone Manor and see Barker fish the clothes of the missing American out of the moat. Barker refuses to explain the situation. At that moment, Douglas appears, alive and well. He hands Watson a written account called ""The Valley of Fear"", which explains why he feared for his life.

Douglas explains that he had spotted an enemy of his, Ted Baldwin, in the area and expected an attack. When Baldwin attempted to shoot Douglas in his study, Douglas grabbed onto Baldwin's shotgun; in the struggle, Baldwin was shot in the face. With Barker's help, Douglas dressed the man in his clothes to confuse his enemies. He then hid himself in the oldpriest holeat Birlstone.

The main narrative pauses to explain Douglas' past in America. Douglas' real name was Birdy Edwards and he had been aPinkerton detectiveinChicago. Working undercover for the Pinkertons, Edwards had travelled to Vermissa Valley (the titular Valley of Fear) under the alias John ""Jack"" McMurdo to infiltrate a corrupt coal minerstrade union, secretly a cover for a murderous gang known as the Scowrers. After Edwards brought the gang to justice, the surviving criminals attempted to kill him. Edwards changed his name to Douglas and fled to England.

Holmes urges Douglas to leave England. Douglas takes this advice, but, shortly after, Holmes learns from Barker that Douglas was lost overboard on the ship to Africa. Holmes believes Moriarty was responsible for ending Douglas' life and he swears to bring Moriarty down.

The Valley of Fearwas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinefrom September 1914 to May 1915.[3]In theStrand, it was published with thirty-one illustrations by Frank Wiles. In the United States, the novel was serialized from September to November 1914 in Associated Sunday Magazine supplements to various newspapers around the country.

The Valley of Fearwas first published in book form byGeorge H. Doran Companyin New York on 27 February 1915, after the serialisation was completed in the United States but before it had finished in theStrand. The first British book edition was published bySmith, Elder & Co.on 3 June 1915. Like the first Holmes novelA Study in Scarlet,The Valley of Fearhas two parts. The first part is titled ""The Tragedy of Birlstone"", and the second is titled ""The Scowrers"".[4]The novel concludes with a short epilogue.

Doyle craftedThe Valley of Fearas ""two parts and a coda"". The novel has a number of major themes, including ""problems of ethical ambiguity"", and attempts to comment seriously on terrorist activity as profiled by American union struggles. Critics have shown how the American union struggles deal with similar issues in the contemporary political situation in Ireland.[5]

Several films have adapted the book, among them:

The Valley of Fearwas the only Sherlock Holmes story not adapted for the 1930s radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and was not adapted for radio until 1960.[8]Radio adaptations of the story include:"

It istea timeand Lady Windermere—who is preparing for hercoming of agebirthday ball that evening—has a visit from a friend, Lord Darlington. She shows off her newfan: a present from her husband. She explains to Lord Darlington that she is upset over the compliments he continues to pay to her, revealing that she has very particular views about what is acceptable in society, due in part to her somewhatPuritanupbringing.

The Duchess of Berwick calls and Lord Darlington leaves shortly thereafter. The Duchess informs Lady Windermere that her husband may be betraying her marriage by making repeated visits to another woman, aMrs Erlynne, and possibly giving her large sums of money. These rumours have been gossip among London society for quite a while, though seemingly this is the first Lady Windermere has heard about it.

Following the departure of the Duchess, Lady Windermere decides to check her husband'sbank book. She finds the book in a desk and sees that nothing appears amiss, though on returning she discovers a second bank book: one with alock. After prying the lock open, she finds it lists large sums of money given to Mrs Erlynne.

At this point, Lord Windermere enters and she confronts him. Though he cannot deny that he has had dealings with Mrs Erlynne, he states that he is not betraying Lady Windermere. He requests that she send Mrs Erlynne an invitation to her birthday ball that evening to help her back into society. When Lady Windermere refuses, he writes out an invitation himself. Lady Windermere makes clear her intention to cause a scene if Mrs Erlynne appears, to which Lord Windermere responds that it would be in her best interest not to do so.

Lady Windermere leaves in disgust to prepare for the party, and Lord Windermere reveals insoliloquythat he is protecting Mrs Erlynne's true identity to save his wife extreme humiliation.

Act II opens in the Windermeres'drawing roomduring the birthday ball that evening. Various guests enter, and make small-talk. Lord Windermere enters and asks Lady Windermere to speak with him, but she brushes him off.

A friend of Lord Windermere's, Lord Augustus Lorton (""Tuppy""), pulls him aside to inquire about Mrs Erlynne, with whom Tuppy is enamoured. Lord Windermere reveals that there is nothing untoward in his relationship with Mrs Erlynne, and that she will be attending the ball, which comes as a great relief to Lord Augustus as he was worried about her social standing.

After an unsuccessful attempt to make peace with his wife, Lord Windermere summons the courage to tell the truth to her, but at that moment Mrs Erlynne arrives at the party, where she is greeted coldly by Lady Windermere, spoiling his plan.

Alone, Lady Windermere and Lord Darlington discuss Mrs Erlynne's attendance. Lady Windermere is enraged and confused and asks Lord Darlington to be her friend. Instead of friendship, Lord Darlington takes advantage of Lady Windermere's tragic state and professes his love to her, offering her his life, and inviting her to risk short-term social humiliation for a new life with him. Lord Darlington sets her an ultimatum to try to convince her to take action immediately, while still in a state of shock. Lady Windermere is shocked by the revelation, and finds she does not have the courage to take the offer. Heartbroken, Lord Darlington announces that he will be leaving the country the next day and that they will never meet again, and leaves.

The guests begin to leave, and say their goodnights to Lady Windermere—some remarking positively about Mrs Erlynne. On the other side of the room Mrs Erlynne is discussing her plans with Lord Windermere; she intends to marry Lord Augustus and will require some money from Lord Windermere.

Later, Lady Windermere, in spite of her earlier reluctance, decides to depart the house at once for Lord Darlington, and leaves a note to that effect for Lord Windermere. Mrs Erlynne discovers the note and that Lady Windermere has gone, and is curiously worried by this revelation. While reading the note, a brief monologue reveals that she is in fact Lady Windermere's mother and made a similar mistake herself twenty years previously. She takes the letter and exits to locate Lady Windermere."

Lucy accepts Holmwood's, but all remain friends. Mina joins Lucy on holiday in Whitby. Lucy begins tosleepwalk. After Dracula's ship lands in Whitby, he begins to stalk Lucy. Mina receives a letter about her missing fiancé's illness and goes to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill; Seward's old teacher—Professor Abraham Van Helsing—determines the nature of her condition, but he refuses to disclose it, instead diagnosing it as acuteblood-loss. Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a necklace of them. Lucy's mother removes the garlic flowers, not knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra dies of aheart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a ""bloofer lady"" (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is Lucy. Seward, Morris, Arthur and Van Helsing go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They stake her heart,beheadher, and fill her mouth with garlic. Jonathan Harker and his new bride Mina return and join the campaign against Dracula.

Everyone stays at Seward's asylum as the men begin to hunt Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient,Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their life force. After Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he uses Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times, drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on the final visit, cursing her to become a vampire after her death unless Dracula is killed. The men discover that Dracula has distributed his boxes of earth around various properties in London. After sterilizing most of the distributed boxes, the group fails to trap the Count in hisPiccadillyhouse and learns that Dracula is fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing exploits Mina's faint psychic connection to Dracula to track his movements and they pursue, guided by Mina.

InGalatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Harker and Holmwood pursue Dracula's boat on the river, while Morris and Seward follow them on land. Dracula's box is loaded onto a wagon byRomanimen; the hunters attack and rout the Romani. HarkerdecapitatesDracula as Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Romani. He dies, at peace knowing that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.

Bram Stokerwas born inClontarf, Dublinon 8 November 1842 as the third of seven children. A sickly child, he was homeschooled before attending a private day school.[1]Stoker attendedTrinity College Dublinin the 1860s and began writing theatre reviews in the early 1870s. After Stoker wrote a review of a performance by stage actorHenry Irving, the two became friends. In 1878, Irving offered Stoker a job as the business manager of London'sLyceum Theatre, which he accepted. He marriedFlorence Balcombelater that year.[2]Biographer Lisa Hopkins notes that this role required Stoker to be sociable and introduced him to the elites ofVictorian London. Nonetheless, Stoker described himself as a private person who closely guarded his thoughts.[3]

He supplemented his theatre income by writingromanceandsensation novels,[4][5][a]but was more closely identified during his lifetime with the theatre than he was with the literary world.[7]By the time of his death in 1912, Stoker had published 18 books.[8]Draculawas Stoker's seventh published book, followingThe Shoulder of Shasta(1895) and precedingMiss Betty(1898).[9][b]Stoker's grand-nephew,Daniel Farson, wrote that Stoker may have died from syphilis, but this is widely disputed by scholars.[c]Novelist and playwrightHall Caine, a close friend of Stoker's,[d]wrote in Stoker's obituary inThe Daily Telegraphthat—besides hisbiographyon Irving—Stoker wrote only ""to sell"" and ""had no higher aims"".[15]

Folkloric vampires predate Stoker's Dracula by hundreds of years.[16]Stoker adopted some characteristics of folkloric vampires for his own, such as their aversion to garlic and staking as a means of killing them.[17]He invented other attributes—for example, Stoker's vampires must be invited into one's home, sleep on earth from their homeland and have no reflection in mirrors.[18]Sunlight is not fatal to Dracula in the novel—this was an invention of the unauthorisedDraculafilmNosferatu(1922)—but it does weaken him.[19][20]Some of Stoker's inventions applied unrelated lore to vampires for the first time; for example, Dracula has no reflection because of a folkloric concept that mirrors show the human soul.[20]Some Irish scholars have suggestedIrish folkloreas an inspiration for the novel,[21]for example the revenantAbhartach,[21]and the 11th-century High King of IrelandBrian Boru.[22][e]DraculascholarElizabeth Millernotes that in his childhood Stoker was exposed to supernatural tales and Irish oral history involving premature burials and staked bodies.[24]

Count Draculahas literary progenitors.John William Polidori's ""The Vampyre"" (1819) includes an aristocratic vampire with powers of seduction.[25]The lesbian vampire ofSheridan Le Fanu'sCarmilla(1872) can transform into a cat, as Dracula can transform into a dog.[26]Dracula resembles earlier Gothic villains in appearance,[27]with Miller comparing him to the villains ofAnn Radcliffe'sThe Italian(1796) andMatthew Gregory Lewis'sThe Monk(1796).[28]

There is almost unanimous consensus that Dracula was inspired, in part, by Henry Irving. Scholars note the Count's tall and lean physique and aquiline nose,[29]withDraculascholarWilliam Hughesspecifically citing the influence of Irving's performance asShylockin aLyceum Theatreproduction ofThe Merchant of Venice.[30]Stoker's contemporaries remarked upon the similarity.[31]Stoker had praised a performance of Irving as ""a wonderful impression of a dead man fictitiously alive [with eyes like] cinders of glowing red from out the marble face"".[32]Louis S. Warrenwrites thatDraculawas founded on ""the fear and animosity his employer inspired in him"".[33][f]Miller contests this, describing Stoker's attitude towards him as ""adulation"".[35]

Historical figures have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula but there is no consensus. In a 1972 book,Raymond T. McNallyandRadu Florescupopularised the idea thatÁrmin Vámbérysupplied Stoker with information aboutVlad Dracula, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler.[36][g]Their investigation, however, found nothing about ""Vlad, Dracula, or vampires"" within Vámbéry's published papers,[38]nor in Stoker's notes about their meeting.[37]Miller calls the link to Vlad III ""tenuous"", indicating that Stoker incorporated a large amount of ""insignificant detail"" from his research, andrhetoricallyasking why he would omit Vlad III's infamous cruelty.[39][h]McNally additionally suggested in 1983 that the crimes ofElizabeth Báthoryinspired Stoker.[42][i]A book used by Stoker for research,The Book of Were-Wolves, does contain some information on Báthory, but Stoker never took notes from the short section devoted to her.[45]Miller and her co-authorRobert Eighteen-Bisangconcur that there is no evidence Báthory inspired Stoker.[46][j][k]

Prior to writing the novel, Stoker researched extensively, assembling over 100 pages of notes, including chapter summaries and plot outlines.[49][l]Stoker undertook some of his research at a library at Whitby in the summer of 1890 but most was done at theLondon Library.[51]The earliest dated notes are from 8 March 1890, comprising an outline of the novel's opening.[52]Joseph S. Beirman notes that it differs from the final novel ""in only a few details"": The Count and Harker are not given names. The wordvampireis not used explicitly, but it depicts the Count's possessive fury over Harker and a female who attempts ""to kiss him not on lips but throat"".[53][52]In February 1892, Stoker wrote a 27-chapter outline of the novel; according to Miller, ""all the key pieces of the jigsaw were in place"".[54]

Stoker's notes reveal other scrapped concepts. Bierman says that Stoker always intended to write an epistolary novel but originally set it in Styria instead of Transylvania.[53]Other concepts from the notes include a German professor called Max Windshoeffel confronting a ""Count Wampyr"" and one of the vampire hunters would have been slain by awerewolf.[55][m]Stoker biographer Barbara Belford notes evidence that Stoker intended to write adetective story, with a detective called Cotford and apsychical investigatorcalled Singleton.[57]

Stoker took the name Dracula from William Wilkinson's history of Wallachia and Moldavia (1820),[23]which he probably found in Whitby's public library while holidaying there in 1890.[58]Stoker copied the following footnote from the book: ""Dracula means devil. Wallachians were accustomed to give it as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous by courage, cruel actions or cunning"".[59]

Stoker stated that that it took him about three years to write the novel, and it is likely that he wrote most of the manuscript during his summer holidays inCruden Bay, Scotland from 1893 to 1896.[60]Stoker generally wrote in spare time from his duties as Irving's business manager, and the long gestation of the novel is indicative of the importance he placed on it.[61][62]

Early Stoker biographer Barbara Belford noted the novel looked ""shabby"" because of a last-minute title change;[63]the printer's copy of the typescript, with hand-written amendments, is titledThe Un-Dead.[64][n]The surviving typewritten publishing agreement was signed and dated 25 May 1897; Peter Beal ofSotheby'ssuggests its signing one day before the official publication date indicates that it was a formality.[66]To protect his copyright interest for adaptations,[o]Stoker organised a reading of his stage adaptation of the novel in the week before publication in theLyceum Theatre. A small group, primarily theatre staff, attended the reading, andEdith Craigplayed Mina.[68]

Bound in yellow cloth and titled in red letters,Draculawas published in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. It cost 6shillings.[69]Uncertainty exists around the exact date of publication, but it was probably published on 26 May 1897. Stoker wrote toWilliam Gladstonethat the novel would be released on the 26th.[70][p]Paul McAlduff writes that it was published ""on or about May 26"".[72]Eighteen-Bisang states it could have been published anywhere from late May to June 1897.[73]

Stoker's mother,Charlotte Stoker, enthused about the novel and predicted it would bring her son immense financial success. She was wrong: the novel, although reviewed well, failed to earn Stoker much money and did not establish his critical reputation until after his death.[74]For the first thousand sales ofDracula, Stoker earned no royalties.[5]Following serialisation by American newspapers,Doubleday & McClurepublished an American edition in 1899 with some textual changes.[63]A cheaper paperback version was published by Constable in 1901, but few copies have survived.[75]The text is around 15% shorter than the original but it is not known if Stoker made the amendments.[76]Since its publication,Draculahas never beenout of print.[77]

An edition of the novel edited by McNally and Florescu in 1979 was the first to includeDracula's ""missing chapter"", ""Dracula's Guest"".[78]Bram's widowFlorence Stokerincluded the chapter as a short story inDracula's Guest and Other Weird Tales(1914), two years after his death.[79]While some commentators have described the prose asDracula'sdiscarded first chapter, Clive Leatherdale contests this, arguing that the material was incorporated into the published novel.[80]

Draculais anepistolary novel.[81]Compared to other elements of the novel, critic David Seed writes that its epistolary structure has been neglected in analyses.[82]Critics note Stoker's decision to structure the novel this way may relate to a 19th-century trend of publishing diaries and travelogue accounts,[83]especially with Harker's account of the journey to Transylvania.[84]Seed writes that Harker's initial four chapters function as a ""miniaturised-pastiche-Gothic novel""—replacing Radcliffe's use of theApennine MountainsinThe Mysteries of Udolpho(1794) with theCarpathian MountainsofTransylvania[85]—and places this within the Gothic tradition ofintertextuality.[86]

David Seed argues that the structure only provides a narrative voice to Dracula's opponents,[87]while Miller writes that the ""collaborative narration"" reinforces the idea that Dracula must be defeated by the combined effort of his opponents.[83]Allison Case says Seed views that Dracula's absence generates tension by offering only ""tantalizing glimpses"" of his activities,[87]while literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that it highlights the power struggle between the vampire and his hunters.[88]Similarly, Allison Case views the structure as representing a power struggle between Mina and the male protagonists for ""narrative mastery"".[89]Seed notes that the narrative's style distances the reader from its plot. Dracula's journey on theDemeteris captured by the captain on thelogbook, then ""translated by the Russian consul, transcribed by a local journalist, and finally pasted by Mina into her journal"".[90]

Draculais an enduring work ofGothic literature,[91]with some critics locating it within the traditions ofIrish GothicorUrban Gothic.[92][93][94]John C. Tibbetts considersDraculaa prototype for later themes in the Gothic genre.[95]The novel is characteristically Gothic in its depiction of the supernatural, preoccupation with the past,[96]and embodying of the racial, gendered and sexual anxieties offin de siècleEngland.[97]Count Dracula generally represents these tensions: cultural criticJack Halberstamnotes that he is masculinised and feminised;[98]Jerrold E. Hogle highlights his attraction to both Jonathan and Mina, and his appearance as racially western and eastern.[99]Miller notes that the Count's physical characteristics were typical of Gothic villains during Stoker's lifetime, specifically citing his hooked nose,pallor, large moustache and thick eyebrows as influenced by his villainous predecessors.[100]Draculadeviates from other Gothic tales before it by firmly establishing its time as the modern era,[101]a point raised by one contemporary reviewer.[102]Writers of the mode were drawn to the Eastern Europe setting because travelogues presented it as a land of primitive superstitions.[103]

Modern critics frequently write thatDraculahad a mixed critical reception upon publication.[104]Carol Margaret Davison, for example, notes an ""uneven"" response from critics contemporary to Stoker.[69]John Edgar Browning, a scholar whose research focuses onDraculaand literary vampires, conducted a review of the novel's early criticism in 2012 and determined thatDraculahad been ""a critically acclaimed novel"".[105][q]Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu'sIn Search of Dracula(1972) mentions the novel's ""immediate success"".[107][r]Other works aboutDraculaalso published in 1972 concur; Gabriel Ronay says the novel was ""recognised by fans and critics alike as a horror writer's stroke of genius"",[108]and Anthony Masters mentions the novel's ""enormous popular appeal"".[109]Since the 1970s,Draculahas been the subject of significant academic interest; the novel has spawned many nonfiction books and articles, and has a dedicated peer-reviewed journal.[48]Publishers started creating editions aimed at classroom teaching in the 1980s, providing the novel alongside historical context and scholarly analysis.[110]The novel's complexity has permitted a flexibility of interpretation, with Anca Andriescu Garcia describing interest from scholars ofpsychoanalysis,postcolonialism, social class and the Gothic genre.[111]

Contemporary reviewers frequently compared the novel to other Gothic writers. Comparisons to novelistWilkie CollinsandThe Woman in White(1859) were especially common, owing to similarities in structure and style.[113][s]A review appearing inThe Booksellernotes that the novel could almost have been written by Collins,[114]and an anonymous review inSaturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Artwrote thatDraculaimproved upon the style of Gothic pioneerAnn Radcliffe;[115]Radcliffe was also referenced byThe Daily Mail,[t]which also highlightedThe Mysteries of Udolpho,Frankenstein(1818), andThe Fall of the House of Usher(1839).[112][116]Another anonymous writer described Stoker as ""the Edgar Allan Poe of the nineties"".[117]Other favourable comparisons to other Gothic novelists included theBrontë sistersandMary Shelley.[118][69]Arthur Conan Doylesent a letter to Stoker after readingDracula, writing: ""The old Professor is most excellent and so are the two girls. I congratulate you with all my heart for having written so fine a book.""[119]

Many of these early reviews were charmed by Stoker's treatment of the vampire myth.The Daily Telegraphcalled it the best vampire story ever written.The Daily Telegraph'sreviewer noted that while earlier Gothic works, likeThe Castle of Otranto, had kept the supernatural far away from the novelists' home countries,Dracula'shorrors occurred in foreign lands and at home in Whitby andHampstead Heath.[102]An Australian paper,The Advertiser, regarded the novel as simultaneouslysensationaland domestic.[120]One reviewer praised the ""considerable power"" of Stoker's prose and described it asimpressionistic. They were less fond of the parts set in England, finding the vampire suited better to tales set far away from home.[121]The British magazineVanity Fairfound Dracula's disdain for garlic unintentionally funny.[122]

Draculawas considered frightening. A review appearing inThe Manchester Guardianin 1897 praised its capacity to entertain, but concluded that Stoker erred in including so much horror.[123]Likewise,Vanity Fairopined that the novel was ""praiseworthy"" and absorbing, but could not recommend it to those who were not ""strong"".[122]Stoker's prose was commended as effective in sustaining the novel's horror by many publications.[124]A reviewer for theSan Francisco Wavecalled the novel a ""literary failure""; they elaborated that coupling vampires with frightening imagery, such as insane asylums and ""unnatural appetites"", made the horror too overt, and that other works in the genre, such asStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886), had more restraint.[125]

Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently discussed themes,[126]and modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality.[127][128]Across the novel's critical history, Miller writes that theorists have collectively argued that the Count breaks virtually ""every Victorian taboo"", includingnon-procreative sex(includingfellatio), transgressive sexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.[129]

Transgressiveor abnormal sexuality withinDraculais a broad topic. Some psychosexual critics explore the novel'sdisruptionof Victoriangender roles; within the Victorian context, Christopher Craft writes males had ""the right and responsibility of vigorous appetite"" while women were required to ""suffer and be still"".[130]Critics highlight the many places in which the novel disrupts these social mores: Jonathan Harker's excitement over the prospect of being penetrated;[131]Dracula's resulting anger and jealousy;[132]and Lucy's transformation into a sexually aggressive predator who drains ""vital fluid"".[133]Some critics, including professorCarol Senf, argue that the novel reflects anxiety about female sexual awakening as a threat to established norms.[134][135]

Draculacontains no overt homosexual acts, but homosexuality andhomoeroticismare elements discussed by critics.[136]Christopher Craft argues that the primary threat Dracula poses is that he will ""seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male"",[137]and reads Harker's excitement to submit as a proxy for ""an implicitly homoerotic desire"".[137]Victorian readers would have identified Dracula with sexual threat.[138]Some critics note that changes made to the 1899 American version of the text reinforce this subtext, wherein Dracula states he will feed on Harker.[139][140]Critics have variously linked these themes tohomoeroticletters Stoker wrote toWalt Whitman, his friendship withOscar Wilde,[141][u]his intensely emotional relationship with Irving, and contemporary rumours of Stoker's almostsexless marriage.[141][143][144]David J. Skalacknowledged the letters' subtext but cautioned against applyinganachronisticmodern sexual labels to Stoker.[145]

Many critics have suggested that the novel reveals a ""reactionaryresponse"" to theNew Womanphenomenon.[89]This is a late-Victorian term used to describe an emerging class of women with increased social and economic control over their lives.[146][147][148]Several critics describe the battle against Dracula as a fight for control over women's bodies.[149][150]Senf suggests that Stoker was ambivalent about the New Woman phenomenon,[151]while Signorroti argues that the novel's discomfort with female sexual autonomy reflects Stoker's dislike for the movement.[147]Both Lucy and Mina have characteristics associated with the New Woman;[152][v]Mina, who plays an important role in Dracula's defeat, repeatedly expresses contempt for the concept.[154][151]Senf notes that Lucy is punished for expressing dissatisfaction with her social position as a woman. After her transformation into a vampire, her defeat by the vampire hunters symbolises the re-establishment of ""male supremacy"".[155]

Dracula, and specifically the Count's migration to Victorian England, is frequently read as emblematic ofinvasion literature,[156]and a projection of fears about racial pollution.[157]In an influentialpostcolonialistanalysis,[158]Stephen Arata describes the novel's cultural context of mounting anxiety in Britain over the decline of theBritish Empire, the rise of otherworld powers, and a ""growing domestic unease"" over the morality of imperial colonisation.[159]Arata regards the novel as an instance of ""reverse colonisation"": fear of other races invading England and weakening its racial purity.[160]Patricia McKee writes that Dracula represents a negation of white culture while Mina represents ""pure whiteness"".[161]Dracula can be said to both kill white bodies and turn them into theracial Otherin death.[162]Some critics connect the racialisation of Dracula to his depiction as adegenerate criminal.[163][164]

Critics frequently identifyantisemiticthemes and imagery in the novel. Between 1891 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England increased sixfold, mainly due to antisemitic legislation andpogromsin eastern Europe.[165]Examples cited byJack Halberstamof antisemitic connections include Dracula's appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and ""lack of allegiance"" to one country.[166][w]Dracula's appearance resembles some other cultural depictions of Jews, such asFagininCharles Dickens'sOliver Twist(1838), andSvengaliofGeorge du Maurier'sTrilby(1895).[168]Jewish people were frequently described as parasites inVictorian literature; Halberstam highlights fears that Jews would spread diseases of the blood, and one journalist's description of Jews as ""Yiddish bloodsuckers"".[169]Daniel Renshaw writes that any antisemitism in the text is ""semi-subliminal""; he writes that Dracula is not Jewish but does reflect the 19th-century conception of Jewish people. Renshaw frames the novel more broadly as a general suspicion of all foreigners.[170]

The novel's depiction ofSlovaksandRomani peoplehas attracted limited scholarly attention.[171]In the novel, Harker describes the Slovaks as ""barbarians"" and their boats as ""primitive"", reflecting his imperialistic condescension towards other cultures.[172]Peter Arnds writes that the Count's control over the Romani and his abduction of young children evoke folk superstitions about Romani people stealing children, and that his ability to transform into a wolf is related to xenophobic beliefs about the Romani as animalistic.[173]Croley argues that Dracula's association with the Romani made him suspect in the eyes of Victorian England, where they were stigmatised owing to beliefs that they ate ""unclean meat"" and lived among animals.[174]

Draculais saturated with religious imagery. Christopher Herbert regards the novel as aparableabout conflict with an enemy who opposes Christ and Christianity.[175]Scholars discuss the novel's depiction of religion in relation to late Victorian anxieties about the threat which secularism, scientific rationalism and the occult posed to Christian beliefs and morality.[176]Stoker himself had a lifelong interest insupernaturalinquiry,[177]and Herbert writes that he mixes the supernatural and superstitious beliefs with religious elements, resulting in metaphors about moral uncleanness becoming literal elements of the text's ""occult reality"".[178]Herbert notes that theblood of Christis important to Christian ritual and imagery,[179]and Richard Noll notes that actual consumption of human blood is one of the oldestJudeo-Christiantaboos.[180]

The vampire hunters use many weapons—including Christian practices and symbols (prayer, crucifixes andconsecrated hosts), folkloric practices (garlic, staking and decapitation) and contemporary technology (typewriters,phonographs, telegrams, blood transfusions andWinchester rifles)—in their battle against Dracula.[181][182][183]Sanders argues that Stoker presents Christianity as a religion that can be instrumentalised and incorporated into scientific knowledge.[184]Herbert describes Van Helsing's ""Christian purification"" of Lucy as punitively addressing her promiscuity, and the resulting framing of Christianity as a means towards the ""eradication ofdeviancy"".[185]

Critics discuss the novel in relation toBritish rule in IrelandandIrish nationalism. Considerable debate exists over whetherDraculais an Irish novel; while it is largely set in England, Stoker was born in British-ruled Ireland and lived there for the first 30 years of his life.[186][187]Though born into aProtestantfamily, he was distanced from the religion's more conservative factions.[188]

Ralph Ingelbien notes that ""recognizably nationalist"" critics likeTerry EagletonandSeamus Deanefavoured readings of Dracula as ""a bloodthirsty caricature of the aristocratic landlord"" where the vampire represents the death offeudalism.[189]Bruce Stewart changes the focus to the lower classes,[189]suggesting Dracula and his Romani followers more likely represented violence byIrish National Land Leagueactivists.[190]Michael Valdez Moses compares Dracula to the disgracedCharles Stewart Parnell, leader of theIrish Home Rule movementfrom 1880 to 1882.[188][191]Robert Smart argues that Stoker's experience during theGreat Famine(1845–1852) influenced the novel,[192]with Stewart also noting this as historical context.[186]

Some critics discuss Count Dracula'snoble title. Literary criticFranco Morettiwrites that he is an aristocrat ""only in a manner of speaking"", citing his lack of servants, simple clothing, and lack of aristocratic hobbies. Moretti suggests that Dracula's blood thirst represents capital's desire to accumulate more capital.[193]More generally, Moretti argues the novel evinces cultural anxiety about foreigncapitalist monopoliesfunctioning as a return of feudalism.[194]Chris Baldick maintains this line of analysis, describing Dracula as an undead symbol of feudalism but concluding that the novel is more concerned with ""sexual and religious terrors"".[195]Mark Neocleous writes that Dracula symbolises the victory of the bourgeoisie over feudalism.[196]InDas Kapital,Karl Marxcompared thebourgeoisie's exploitation ofworkersto a vampire draining blood.[197]He uses vampires as a metaphor three times inDas Kapital, but these predate the writing ofDracula.[198]

Contagious disease was a topic of social and medical concern in late Victorian England.[199]Vampirism can represent disease, being both an initial infection and the resulting illness.[200]The novel characterises vampirism with terms fromsocial degeneration theory,[201]an 18th- and 19th-century social and biological concept arising from fear over the deterioration of the ""human condition"";[202]Victorian psychiatry, known then as ""alienism"";[203]and anthropology.[204]Theories of degeneracy propagated Victorian-era beliefs about poor moral character beingtransmissiblelike a pathogen.[201]Jack Halberstamwrites that Dracula and Renfield's relationship suggests that vampirism is ""a psychological disorder, an addictive activity"".[205]He notes that Renfield, and by association Dracula, is described by doctors using terminology more appropriate for describing animals.[205]Brian Aldisswrites that Count Dracula represents the initial disease while Renfield's madness is a symptom of advanced infection.[206]Halbertstam highlights that disease was frequently associated with Jews during the period.[207]Sexually transmitted infection, particularlysyphilis, is a frequent topic.[208]Literary critic Martin Willis writes that the novel depicts Victorian discourse over the origin, cause and treatment of disease, especially in the context of Lucy's treatment and eventual death.[200]"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544,Anne's House of Dreams,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne%27s_House_of_Dreams,"The book begins with Anne and Gilbert's wedding, which takes place in the Green Gables orchard. After the wedding, they move to their first home together, which Anne calls their ""house of dreams"".  Gilbert finds them a small house on the seashore at Four Winds Point, an area near the village of Glen St. Mary, where he is to take over his uncle's medical practice.

In Four Winds, Anne and Gilbert meet many interesting people, such as Captain Jim, a former sailor who is now the keeper of the lighthouse, and Miss Cornelia Bryant, an unmarried woman in her 40s who lives alone in an emerald-green house and deems the Blythes part of ""the race that knows Joseph"". Anne also meets her new neighbour, Leslie Moore, who lost her beloved brother at the age of 12 and her father at 14, and then was forced by her mother to marry the mean-spirited and unscrupulous Dick Moore at 16. She felt free for a year or so after Dick disappeared on a sea voyage, but Captain Jim happened upon him in Cuba and brought him home, amnesiac, brain-damaged and generally helpless, and now dependent on Leslie like a ""big baby"". Leslie becomes friends with Anne, but is sometimes bitter towards her because she is so happy and free, when Leslie can never have that.

Anne's former guardian Marilla Cuthbert visits her occasionally and still plays an important role in her life. Marilla is present when Anne gives birth to her first child, Joyce, who dies shortly after birth (as Montgomery's second son did). After the baby's death, Anne and Leslie become closer as Leslie feels that Anne now understands tragedy and pain—as Leslie puts it, her happiness, although still great, is no longer perfect, so there is less of a gulf between them.

Later in the story, Leslie rents a room in her house to a writer named Owen Ford, who is the grandson of the former owners of Anne's House of Dreams, the Selwyns. Owen, who is looking to write the Great Canadian Novel, finds the inspiration he was looking for in Captain Jim's shipboard diary, and transforms it into ""The Life-Book of Captain Jim"". While Owen is finishing the novel, he and Leslie independently realize they have feelings for each other, but both know they cannot do anything about them. Owen leaves the Island and Leslie is even more miserable being trapped in her marriage to Dick.

Gilbert examines Dick Moore and suspects that if Dick underwent surgery on his skull, he might recover his faculties. Anne and Miss Cornelia are both opposed to the surgery, fearing that Leslie's life will become infinitely harder if Dick returns to himself, but Gilbert feels obligated to let Leslie know there is a chance for Dick. Leslie consents, and Dick undergoes the surgery in Montreal; when he awakens, he reveals that he is actually Dick's cousin George, who accompanied Dick to Cuba and was with him when Dick died of yellow fever twelve years before. George resembles Dick strongly because their fathers were brothers and their mothers were sisters, and both had the same peculiar eye colouring abnormality (heterochromia) by which Captain Jim recognized ""Dick"" in Cuba years before.

Leslie, abruptly set free by this news, returns home, and considers taking a nursing course to get on with her life. Owen Ford returns to the Island to court Leslie after Miss Cornelia informs him of what has happened, and they become engaged. While this is going on, Anne gives birth to her second child, a healthy son. He is named James Matthew, for Anne's guardian Matthew Cuthbert and for Captain Jim.

At the end of the book, Owen Ford's book is published, and Captain Jim dies with a smile on his face after reading his advance copy. Miss Cornelia, thought to be a confirmed spinster, announces that she has decided to marry Marshall Elliott, who may be aGritbut at least is a Presbyterian; she says she could have had him at any time but refused to marry him until he cut his long hair and shaved his long beard off, which he had refused to do for twenty years untilthe Grits came into power.  Finally, Anne, Gilbert, Jem and their housekeeper, Susan Baker, move to the old Morgan house in the Glen, later to be named Ingleside. Anne is greatly saddened to leave the House of Dreams, but knows that the little house is outgrown and Gilbert's work as a doctor requires him to live closer to town.

This book introduces Susan Baker, the elderly spinster who is the Blythes' maid-of-all-work.

Helen Schlegel visits the Wilcoxes' country house, Howards End, where she becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox but soon regrets the hasty decision and they break off the engagement. At a concert, Helen takes Leonard Bast's umbrella by mistake and heads home. After awkwardly retrieving it, Leonard,  an impoverished clerk, leaves with her sister Margaret's card.

Later, the Wilcoxes move to London and become neighbours with the Schlegels. Margaret befriends Ruth Wilcox, the matriarch of the family, who feels a deep connection to Howards End. Ruth, on her deathbed, writes a note leaving the house to Margaret, but her widowed husband Henry and his children conceal the inheritance and burn the note.

Leonard Bast lives with a woman named Jacky. When Jacky shows up at the Schlegels' house looking for her ""husband"" one night, Helen is mystified. Leonard later explains the situation: he had been out walking under the stars that night and Jacky found Margaret's card. Henry Wilcox and his daughter Evie visit the Schlegels, and Henry recommends that Leonard resign from his job due to the anticipated collapse of his employer’s company. Time passes as Margaret and Henry's friendship turns into a romance. They become engaged despite opposition from Henry's children, who remember and fear their mother’s dying wish to give Howards End to Margaret.

Helen appears at the wedding of Evie Wilcox with Leonard and Jacky, who are now married and in dire financial straits because of Henry's thoughtless advice. He recognizes Jacky as his former mistress and accuses the Schlegels and Basts of plotting against him. Although disturbed by the revelation, Margaret forgives Henry and wishes to salvage their relationship.

Helen strongly disapproves of Henry's mistreatment of the Basts and spends the night with Leonard discussing their plight. Helen later confides in her brother Tibby and decides to send financial help to the Basts, but Leonard returns the first cheque and declines further assistance.

After her wedding to Henry, Margaret becomes concerned about Helen's restless travels. When their Aunt Juley falls ill, Margaret asks Helen to return to England, but Helen refuses to see the family. Margaret and Henry visit Howards End, hoping to surprise Helen, and discover her secret pregnancy. Margaret stands by her sister and urges Henry to forgive her as she has forgiven him, but he remains unconvinced.

Leonard arrives at Howards End the next day, tormented by his affair with Helen and unaware of her presence there. Charles Wilcox attacks Leonard, who stumbles backward into a bookcase. It collapses and falls on him, covering him with books. Leonard, who had undiagnosed heart disease, experiences heart failure and dies. Margaret decides to leave Henry, but he reveals that Charles will be charged with manslaughter by the local authorities. Charles is found guilty and sentenced to prison.

Henry, overwhelmed by shame, agrees to honour Ruth's wish and leave Howards End to Margaret. He also stipulates that, after Margaret's death, the property will pass to the son of Helen and Leonard. Helen returns to Howards End, and the family warmly welcomes her and her son.

In 1998, theModern LibraryrankedHowards End38th on its list of the100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

AManchester Guardianreview written in the year of the novel's publication praised it as ""a novel of high quality written with what appears to be a feminine brilliance of perception.""[3]

Critics have describedHowards Endas a ""Condition-of-England novel"" for its depiction of the poverty and precarity of the Bast family as well as the rapid changes in the social and economic structure of England in theEdwardianperiod.[4]The Wilcox family represent ""new money"" as well as global capitalism with their ownership of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company, while the German Schlegel sisters represent the educated, cosmopolitan ""New Woman"" and raise questions of women's suffrage. The Wilcoxes were possibly inspired by the harsh landlords of Forster's childhood home,[5]while the Schlegels were loosely based onVirginia Woolfand her sisterVanessa Bell, who were Forster's contemporaries in the liberal and humanist-minded Bloomsbury Group.[6]

The eponymous house, Howards End, ""is a mystical symbol of the beauty and gentility of that fast-disappearing world. The question of who will own it – for which read England's social future – dominates the book.""[7]Located in the countryside, away from London, it has immense sentimental value for Mrs Ruth Wilcox, who threatens the male line of inheritance when she attempts to leave the house to her new friend Margaret Schlegel upon her death. The core message of the novel is its epigraph, ""Only connect"", a similar theme to that of Forster's novelMaurice, which also features cross-class relationships. In the end, the three families are forced into a form of uneasy reconciliation; critic Barbara Morden argues:

Several critics have also assessed the influence of Forster's closeted homosexuality on the novel. CriticVivian Gornickargued that Forster's lack of romantic or sexual experience at the time of writing ""haunts"" the book: ""Unable to achieve emotional experience himself, yet impelled to write about it, he here adopts the intellectually intelligent voice of a writer who senses the import of what lies behind the tragedy of life but doesn't really know what he's talking about.""[9]"

The company is completed by Cyrus's dog ""Top"".a

After flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic,unknown island, described as being located at34°57′S150°30′W﻿ / ﻿34.950°S 150.500°W﻿ /-34.950; -150.500(Southern Pacific Ocean/Asian:Oceanian side), about 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) east of New Zealand and about 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) from Virginia. They name it ""Lincoln Island"" in honor ofAbraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks,nitroglycerin, iron, anelectric telegraph, a cave home inside a stony cliff called ""Granite House"", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the ""Bonadventure"". They start to think of themselves as colonists rather than castaways.

During their stay on the island, the ""colonists"" endure bad weather and domesticate anorangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseendeus ex machina, responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from adugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.

The group finds amessage in a bottledirecting them to rescue acastawayon nearbyTabor Island, who is none other thanTom Ayrton(fromIn Search of the Castaways). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.

Ayrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly evading death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contractsmalariabut is saved by a box ofquininesulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds except for a little red spot on each of them.

The island is revealed to beCaptain Nemo's hideout, and home port of theNautilus. Having escaped themaelstromat the end ofTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, theNautilussailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned theNautilusto its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an ""electric gun"". On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of arajaof the then-independent territory ofBundelkundand a nephew of the Indian heroTippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failedIndian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to adesert islandwith twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of theNautilusand adopted the new name of ""Captain Nemo"". Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo's final words are ""God and my country!"" (""Independence!"", in Verne's original manuscript). TheNautilusis scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.b

Afterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find shelter on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the shipDuncan, which had come to rescue Ayrton, but was redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to the United States they form a new colony in Iowa, financed with Nemo's gifts.

In the United States the first English printing began inScribner's Monthly, April 1874, as a serial.[5]In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston Low, and Searle published the first British edition ofMysterious Islandin three volumes entitledDropped from the Clouds,The Abandoned, andThe Secret of the Island(195,000 words).  In November 1875 Scribner's published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator,W. H. G. Kingston, was a famous author of boys' adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator ofMysterious Islandand his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from ""Smith"" to ""Harding""; ""Smith"" is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers. This became the standard translation for more than a century.

In 1876 theStephen W. Whitetranslation (175,000 words) appeared first in the columns ofThe Evening Telegraphof Philadelphia and subsequently as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book. This translation is more faithful to the original story and restores the death scene of Captain Nemo, but there is still condensation and omission of some sections such as Verne's description of how a sawmill works. In the 20th century two more abridged translations appeared: the Fitzroy Edition (Associated Booksellers, 1959) abridged by I. O. Evans (90,000 words) andMysterious Island(Bantam, 1970) abridged by Lowell Bair (90,000 words).

Except for the Complete and Unabridged Classics Series CL77 published in 1965 (Airmont Publishing Company, Inc), no other unabridged translations appeared until 2001 when the illustrated version of Sidney Kravitz appeared (Wesleyan University Press) almost simultaneously with the new translation of Jordan Stump published by Random House Modern Library (2001).  Kravitz also translatedShipwrecked Family:  Marooned With Uncle Robinson, published by the North American Jules Verne Society and BearManor Fiction in 2011.

The 2003 English edition ofWrecked on a Reef(1869), a memoir by French shipwreck survivorFrançois Édouard Raynal, has additional appendices by French scholar Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal's book on Verne'sThe Mysterious Island. TheGraftonwas wrecked near New Zealand on theAuckland Islandson 3 January 1864, where the crew of five survived for 19 months before obtaining rescue.Wrecked on a Reef, Raynal's memoir of the incident, was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal's account and loosely based his novel on the true life story ofGraftonshipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.

The novel has been translated intoMarathibyB. R. Bhagwattitled 'निर्जन बेटावरचे धाडसी वीर', which roughly translates as ""Brave Fighters on a Deserted Island"", and has a cult following inMaharashtra. The novel has also been translated toMalayalam, asNigoodadweep, translated by Kesavan Nambisan. There is more than one translation inBengali. The translation by Kuladaranjan Roy is called “আশ্চর্য দ্বীপ” (Aschorjo Dwip) and was republished byKalpabiswa Publicationsin 2023. Another translation by Shamsuddin Nawab fromSheba Prokashoni, published in 1979, is calledRahosshor Dip.

There is also some significance of an adaptation of Captain Nemo and the Mysterious Island in the first arc of the sixth season ofOnce Upon a Time."
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929,The School for Scandal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Scandal,"Scene I: Lady Sneerwell, a wealthy young widow, and her hireling Snake discuss her various scandal-spreading plots. Snake asks why she is so involved in the affairs of Sir Peter Teazle, his ward Maria, and Charles and Joseph Surface, two young men under Sir Peter's informal guardianship, and why she has not yielded to the attentions of Joseph, who is highly respectable. Lady Sneerwell confides that Joseph desires Maria, who is an heiress, and that Maria desires Charles. Thus she and Joseph are plotting to alienate Maria from Charles by putting out rumours of an affair between Charles and Sir Peter's new young wife, Lady Teazle. Joseph arrives to confer with Lady Sneerwell. Maria herself then enters, fleeing the attentions of Sir Benjamin Backbite and his uncle, Crabtree. Mrs. Candour enters and ironically talks about how ""tale-bearers are as bad as the tale-makers."" Soon after that, Sir Benjamin and Crabtree also enter, bringing a good deal of gossip with them. One item is the imminent return of the Surface brothers' rich uncle Sir Oliver from theEast Indies, where he has been for sixteen years; another is Charles' dire financial situation.

Scene II: Sir Peter complains of Lady Teazle's spendthrift ways. Rowley, the former steward of the Surfaces' late father, arrives, and Sir Peter gives him an earful on the subject. He also complains that Maria has refused Joseph, whom he calls ""a model for the young men of the age,"" and seems attached to Charles, whom he denounces as a profligate. Rowley defends Charles, and then announces that Sir Oliver has just arrived from the East Indies. Oliver has instructed them not to tell his nephews of his arrival so that he may ""make some trial of their dispositions"".

Scene I: Sir Peter argues with his wife, Lady Teazle, refusing to be ""ruined by [her] extravagance."" He reminds her of her recent and far humbler country origins. Lady Teazle excuses herself by appealing to ""the fashion"", and departs to visit Lady Sneerwell. Despite their quarrel, Sir Peter still finds himself charmed by his wife even when she is arguing with him.

Scene II: At Lady Sneerwell's, the scandal-mongers have great fun at the expense of friends not present. Lady Teazle and Maria arrive; Lady Teazle joins in, but Maria is disgusted. So is Sir Peter, when he arrives, and rather breaks up the party with his comments. He departs, the others retire to the next room, and Joseph seizes the opportunity to court Maria, who rejects him again. Lady Teazle returns and dismisses Maria, and it is revealed that Lady Teazle is seriously flirting with Joseph – who doesn't want her, but cannot afford to alienate her.

Scene III: Sir Oliver calls on his old friend Sir Peter. He is amused by Sir Peter's marriage to a young wife. Their talk turns to the Surface brothers. Sir Peter praises Joseph's high morals but Sir Oliver suspects that he might be a hypocrite.

Scene I:Rowley describes his plan for Sir Oliver to visit each of the brothersincognitoto test their characters. Sir Oliver will disguise himself as their needy relative Mr. Stanley, and ask each for his help. Rowley also brings in the ""friendly Jew"" Moses, a moneylender who has tried to help Charles, to explain Charles' position. Moses mentions that he is to introduce Charles to yet another moneylender (""Mr. Premium"") that very evening. Sir Oliver decides (at Sir Peter's suggestion) that with Moses' assistance, he will pose as Premium when visiting Charles while still intending to visit Joseph as Stanley.

Sir Peter is left alone and when Maria enters, he tries to convince her to marry Joseph expressing him as a worthier match than Charles, whom she favours. When she is not persuaded, he threatens her with ""the authority of a guardian"". She goes, and Lady Teazle enters asking her husband for two hundred pounds. Sir Peter and Lady Teazle argue again, and conclude that they should separate.

Scene II: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Premium) arrives with Moses at Charles' house. While they are waiting in the hall, Trip, the servant, tries to negotiate a loan on his own account from Moses. Sir Oliver concludes that ""this is the temple of dissipation indeed!""

Scene III: Charles and his raucous guests drink heavily and sing merry songs, as they prepare for a night of gambling. Charles raises a toast to Maria. Moses and ""Premium"" enter, and Sir Oliver is dismayed at the scene. Charles does not recognise his long-lost uncle. Charles frankly asks ""Premium"" for credit, noting that Sir Oliver (whom he believes is in India) will soon leave him a fortune. ""Premium"" discounts this possibility, noting that Sir Oliver could live many years, or disinherit his nephew. He asks if Charles has any valuables of his own to sell for immediate cash. Charles admits that he has sold the family silver and his late father's library, and offers to sell ""Premium"" the family portrait collection. ""Premium"" accepts, but Sir Oliver is silently outraged.

Scene I: Charles goes on to sell all of the family portraits to ""Premium"", using the rolled-up family tree as a gavel. However, he refuses to sell the last portrait, which is of Sir Oliver, out of respect for his benefactor; Charles will not sell it even when ""Premium"" offers as much for it as for all the rest. Moved, Sir Oliver inwardly forgives Charles. Sir Oliver and Moses leave with Rowley entering shortly after, and Charles sends a hundred pounds of the proceeds for the relief of ""Mr. Stanley"", despite Rowley's objection.

Scene II: Sir Oliver, reflecting on Charles's character with Moses, is met by Rowley, who has brought him the hundred pounds sent to ""Stanley."" Declaring ""I’ll pay his debts, and his benevolence too"", Sir Oliver plans to go meet his other nephew in the person of Stanley.

Scene III: Joseph, anxiously awaiting a visit from Lady Teazle, is told by a servant that she has just left ""herchairat themilliner'snext door"" and so has the servant draw a screen across the window (his reason: ""my opposite neighbour is a maiden lady of so curious a temper""). On her entrance, Joseph forswears any interest in Maria, and flirts in earnest with Lady Teazle, perversely suggesting that she should make a ""faux pas"" for the benefit of her reputation. The servant returns to announce Sir Peter, and Lady Teazle hides in panic behind the screen. Sir Peter enters and tells Joseph that he suspects an affair between Charles and Lady Teazle (due to the rumours spread by Joseph and Lady Sneerwell). Joseph hypocritically professes confidence in Charles' and Lady Teazle's honour. Sir Peter confides his intention to give his wife a generous separate maintenance during his life and the bulk of his fortune on his demise. He also urges Joseph to pursue his suit with Maria (much to Joseph's annoyance, as Lady Teazle is listening behind the screen).

Charles's arrival is announced. Sir Peter decides to hide, and have Joseph sound Charles out about his relationship with Lady Teazle. He starts behind the screen, but sees the corner of Lady Teazle'spetticoatthere already. Joseph ""confesses"" that he is not as virtuous as he seems: ""a little French milliner, a silly rogue that plagues me"" is hiding there to preserve her own reputation. Sir Peter then hides in the closet.

Charles now enters and Joseph questions him about Lady Teazle. Charles disclaims any designs on her, noting that Joseph and the lady seem to be intimate. To stop Charles, Joseph whispers to him that Sir Peter is hiding in the closet, and Charles hauls him forth. Sir Peter tells Charles he now regrets his suspicions about him. Charles passes off his comments about Joseph and Lady Teazle as a joke.

When Lady Sneerwell is announced, Joseph rushes out to stop her from coming up. Meanwhile, Sir Peter tells Charles about the ""French milliner"". Charles insists on having a look at her and flings down the screen as Joseph returns, discovering Lady Teazle. Charles, very amused, leaves the other three dumbstruck individuals. Joseph concocts an explanation for Sir Peter of why he and Lady Teazle are together. But she refuses to endorse it and admits that she came to pursue an affair with Joseph; however, having learned of Sir Peter's generosity, she has repented. She denounces Joseph and exits, and the enraged Sir Peter follows as Joseph continues trying to pretend innocence.

Scene I: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Stanley) now visits Joseph. Joseph, like Charles, does not recognise his long-lost uncle. He greets ""Stanley"" with effusive professions of goodwill, but refuses to give ""Stanley"" any financial assistance, saying he has donated all his money to support Charles. ""Stanley"" suggests that Sir Oliver would help him if he was here, and that Joseph might pass on some of what Sir Oliver has given him. But Joseph tells ""Stanley"" that Sir Oliver is in fact very stingy, and has given him nothing except trinkets such as tea, shawls, birds and ""Indian crackers"". Furthermore, Joseph has lent a great deal to his brother, so that he has nothing left for ""Stanley"". Sir Oliver is enraged, as he knows both statements are flat lies – he sent Joseph 12,000 pounds from India. He stifles his anger, and departs amid further effusions. Rowley arrives with a letter for Joseph announcing that Sir Oliver has arrived in town.

Scene II: At Sir Peter's house, Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and Crabtree exchange confused rumours about the Teazle affair. Sir Benjamin says Sir Peter was wounded in a swordfight with Joseph Surface, while Crabtree insists it was a pistol duel with Charles. When Sir Oliver enters, they take him for a doctor and demand news of the wounded man. At that moment Sir Peter arrives to prove the report wrong, and orders the scandalmongers out of his house, with Rowley entering shortly after at hearing Sir Peter's raised voice. Sir Oliver says he has met both of his nephews and agrees with Sir Peter's (former) estimate of Joseph's high character, but then acknowledges with laughter that he knows the story of what happened at Joseph's with the closet and screen. When he leaves, Rowley tells Sir Peter that Lady Teazle is in tears in the next room, and Sir Peter goes to reconcile with her.

Scene III: Lady Sneerwell complains to Joseph that Sir Peter, now that he knows the truth about Joseph, will allow Charles to marry Maria. They plot to use Snake as a witness to a supposed relationship between Charles and Lady Sneerwell, and she withdraws.

Sir Oliver arrives. Joseph takes him for ""Stanley"" and orders him out. Charles arrives and recognises ""Premium"". Despite the identity confusion, both brothers want the man out before Sir Oliver comes. As Charles and Joseph try to eject their incognito uncle, Sir Peter and Lady Teazle arrive with Maria and Rowley, ending Sir Oliver's pretence. Sir Oliver, Sir Peter, and Lady Teazle together condemn Joseph, but Sir Oliver forgives Charles because of his refusal to sell Sir Oliver's picture and his generous aid to his uncle ""Stanley"". Maria, however, declines to give Charles her hand, citing his supposed involvement with Lady Sneerwell. Joseph now reveals Lady Sneerwell. Charles is baffled, and Rowley then summons Snake. Snake, however, has been bribed to turn against Sneerwell, so her lie is exposed. After Lady Teazle tells her that she (Lady Teazle) is withdrawing from the School for Scandal, Lady Sneerwell leaves in a rage, and Joseph follows, supposedly to keep her from further malicious attacks. Charles and Maria are reconciled. Charles makes no promises about reforming, but indicates that Maria's influence will keep him on a ""virtuous path"". The concluding line assures the audience that ""even Scandal dies, if you approve.""

The humorous epilogue, written byGeorge Colman the Elder, is to be ""Spoken by Lady Teazle."" It portrays her as somewhat regretful of leaving country domesticity for London society, and includes an elaborate parody of a famous speech inShakespeare'sOthello.

Various editions of the play exhibit several relatively minor textual differences. One reason is that Sheridan revised his text repeatedly, not only prior to its first production, but afterwards.

In its earliest stages, as detailed byThomas Moore, Sheridan developed two separate play sketches, one initially entitled ""The Slanderers"" that began with Lady Sneerwell and Spatter (equivalent to Snake in the final version), and the other involving the Teazles. He eventually combined these and with repeated revisions and restructuring arrived at substantially the play that we have today.[1]

The play did not appear in an authorised edition during Sheridan's lifetime, though it was printed in Dublin in 1788 from a copy that the author had sent to his sister.[2][3]

Because, as one recent editor has put it, ""The School for Scandalis the most intractable problem Sheridan set his editors"",[4]editions of this play can vary considerably. For example, thePenguin Classicsedition gives a text based on the 1821 edition ofThe Works of the Late Right Honourable Richard Brinsley Sheridanpublished by Murray, Ridgeway, and Wilkie, but states that it has ""been emended from earlier manuscripts"" and gives a detailed listing of these emendations.[5]

The prefatory material to theProject Gutenbergtext of the play acknowledges that ""Current texts may usually be traced, directly or indirectly"", to the 1821 edition, but presents a far different text based on a manuscript in the author's hand.[6]

In the Project Gutenberg text's version of I.1, Lady Sneerwell's accomplice is her cousin Miss Verjuice, not the socially inferior Snake (who appears only in V.3). Here is the opening of the play as given in that text (in which the editor has retained the original spelling and punctuation of Sheridan's manuscript found at Frampton Court):[7]

Sheridan later deleted Verjuice and gave Snake most of her lines, as reflected in the 1821 edition and those editions that follow it. Here is the opening in that text:

This is a significant difference, and some editors[7]and performers[10]have preferred the manuscript version that includes Miss Verjuice. However, the cast list of the first production of the play in 1777 has no ""Miss Verjuice"" listed,[11]showing that the change Sheridan made to combine her part with Snake's predates the premiere.

Another example of strictly verbal differences between the two texts can be found in II.1, where the Project Gutenberg text has Lady Teazle rather more pointed in suggesting that Sir Peter can oblige her by making her his ""widow"" (only implied by her in the 1821 text, leaving him to fill in ""My widow, I suppose?"" and her to add ""Hem! hem!"").[12]Also, in Crabtree's recitation of the imaginary duel between Sir Peter and Charles Surface (V.2), the shot of Sir Peter bounces off a ""little bronzePliny"" in the older version,[13]but the bust is changed to one of ""Shakspeare(sic)"" in the 1821 text.[14]Many other slight differences of a few words here and there can be found throughout the play[5](though these do not impact the plot the way that the deletion of Miss Verjuice does).

The School for Scandalhas been widely admired. The English criticWilliam Hazlittwas particularly effusive in his praise of Sheridan's comedies in general (""everything in themtells; there is no labour in vain""[15]) and of this play in particular:

Edmund Gossecalled the play ""perhaps the best existing English comedy of intrigue"",[16]whileCharles Lambwrote that ""This comedy grew out ofCongreveandWycherley"", but criticised ""sentimental incompatibilities"" even while admitting that ""the gaiety upon the whole is buoyant.""[17]

Samuel Barbercomposed his first full orchestral work asan overtureprogrammedfor the play.

On the other hand, the play has also been criticised for some hints ofanti-Semitism, specifically ""the disparaging remarks made about moneylenders, who were often Jewish.""[18]It is true that the moneylender Moses is portrayed in a comparatively positive light, but the way he is described (as a ""friendly Jew"" and an ""honest Israelite"" by Rowley in III.1) suggest that he is in some way to be considered an exception to Jews in general; also, his ownusuriousbusiness practices as stated to Sir Peter are clearly less than exemplary (e.g., his statement ""If he appears not very anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent; but if you find him in great distress, and want the moneys very bad, you may ask double"" [III.1]). It may be significant that inJohann Zoffany's portrait ofRobert Baddeleyas Moses, we find that ""Under his arm Moses holds a rolled parchment of the Surface family tree that is used as an auction hammer, and he seems to be ticking off pictures in the catalogue"", although in the play Careless is the auctioneer in the relevant scene (IV.1) and Moses has a relatively minor role.[19]

It is notable that at least one 21st-century production (Los Angeles, 2004) has ""sanitized most of what could be deemed as anti-Semitic content"" by changing references to ""Jews"" and ""Jewry"" to ""moneylenders""—a practice that a reviewer termed ""PC-ification"" of the play.[20]Another production, by the Seattle Shakespeare Company in 2007, reportedly did not tamper with this aspect of the text and was commended by a reviewer for ""the courage to face the script's unsavory side.""[21]

Another criticism that has been made of the play involves the characterisation. A writer in the 19th centuryperiodicalAppletons' Journalstates that"
Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19516,The Adventures of Pinocchio,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio,"InTuscany,Italy, acarpenternamed Master Antonio finds a log that he plans to carve into a table leg. However, after being frightened when the log cries out, he gives it to his neighborGeppettowho wants to carve a puppet from it and make a living as a traveling puppeteer. He carves a boy and names him ""Pinocchio"". Once the puppet is finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and into the town, where he is caught by aCarabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto.

Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat, where atalking cricketwarns him of the perils of disobedience and laziness. After being called a wooden head, in retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, accidentally killing it. Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but a chick hatches from the egg and leaves to find food. He knocks on a neighbor's door, but they fear he is pulling a prank and dump water on him. Cold and wet, Pinocchio goes home and lies down on a stove, and upon waking he finds his feet have burned off. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison, gives Pinocchio three pears to eat for breakfast, and makes him a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school and Geppetto makes him a suit of clothing consisting of a dress made of flowered paper, tree bark shoes, and a cap made of dough, and sells his only coat to buy him a spelling book.

On his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre and sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppetsHarlequin,Pulcinellaand Signora Rosaura call out to Pinocchio. This angers the puppet masterMangiafuoco, and he decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner. However, after Pinocchio pleads for his and Harlequin's salvation and he learns of Geppetto's poverty, Mangiafuoco releases him and gives him five gold pieces.

On his way home, Pinocchio meetsa fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame; a whiteblackbirdtries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the Cat eats it. The two convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city ofCatchfools, they will grow into a tree with gold coins. They stop for dinner at the Red Lobster Inn where they trick Pinocchio into paying for their meals and flee after telling the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio they would meet him at the Field of Miracles in the morning.

As Pinocchio sets off for the city of Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears and tells him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again and as he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised asbandits, ambush and attempts to rob him but fails. After biting off the Cat's paw, he escapes to a white house, where he is greeted by a youngfairy with turquoise hairwho says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the Fox and the Cat catch Pinocchio and hang him in a tree and leave after getting tired of waiting for him to suffocate, leaving Pinocchio to die alone and think about his misbehavior.

The Fairy has Pinocchio rescued and calls in three doctors to evaluate him - the Owl says he is alive, the Crow says he is dead, and the Ghost of the Talking Cricket says he is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy offers medicine to Pinocchio, which he takes when several Undertakerrabbitsappear to collect his body. Now recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what happened to the gold coins and his nose grows. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio's lies are causing his nose to grow and calls in a flock ofwoodpeckersto chisel it down to size. She then sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage.

As Pinocchio heads out to find Geppetto, he once again meets the Fox and the Cat, who remind him of the Field of Miracles, and he agrees to go with them and plant his gold. Once there, Pinocchio buries his coins and leaves to wait twenty minutes for it to grow, only for the Fox and the Cat dig up the coins and run away.

Once Pinocchio returns, aparrotmocks him for falling for the Fox and Cat's tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse, where he reports the theft of the coins to agorillajudge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the gorilla judge sentences him to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness. Fortunately, all criminals are released early when the Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies.

As Pinocchio heads back to the forest, he finds an enormoussnakewith a smoking tail blocking the way. He asks the serpent to move, but it remains completely still, and he assumes it is dead. He begins to step over it, but it suddenly rises up and hisses at him, toppling him over onto his head. Struck by Pinocchio's fright and comical position, the snake laughs so hard hebursts an arteryand dies.

Pinocchio then heads back to the Fairy's house in the forest, where he sneaks into a farmer's yard to steal some grapes. He is caught in a weasel trap and encounters aglowworm, where the farmer finds him and ties him up in his doghouse. When Pinocchio foils the chicken-stealingweasels, the farmer frees him as a reward. Pinocchio finally returns to the cottage, but there he finds nothing but a gravestone and believes the Fairy has died.

A friendlypigeonsees Pinocchio mourning the Fairy's death and offers to give him a ride to the seashore, where Geppetto is building a boat to search for Pinocchio. Pinocchio is washed ashore when he tries to swim to his father, who is swallowed byThe Terrible Dogfish. Pinocchio accepts a ride from adolphinto the Island of Busy Bees where everyone works every day. Upon arriving there, Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water, and upon arriving at her house, he recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now old enough to be his mother. She says she will act as his mother, and he will begin going to school. She hints that if he does well in school and is good for one year, then he will become a real boy.

Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, making the other boys jealous. They trick Pinocchio into playing hooky by saying they saw a largesea monsterat the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, they were lying, and a fight breaks out, during which Pinocchio is accused of injuring another boy. He escapes, and along the way saves a drowningMastiffnamed Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio fromThe Green Fisherman, who was going to eat him. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, she gives him another chance.

Pinocchio does excellently in school, and the Fairy promises that he will be a real boy the next day, saying he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked after meetingCandlewick, one of his closest friends, who tells him he is heading to a place calledToyland, where children play all day and never work or study. Pinocchio goes along with him, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.

One morning, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. Amarmottells Pinocchio that he has gotten donkey fever, as boys who play and never study or work turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed, and Pinocchio is sold to a circus where he is trained to do tricks, until he falls and sprains his leg after seeing the Fairy in one of the box seats. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and use his hide to make a drum, and throws him into the sea to drown him. But when he goes to retrieve the corpse, he finds Pinocchio, who explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again. Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea, where the Terrible Dogfish appears and swallows him. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, and they escape with help from a largetunaand look for a new place to live.

Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat, who are now impoverished and lame and blind respectively. They plead for food and money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that they have earned their misfortune. Geppetto and Pinocchio then arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for a farmer, and recognizes his dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.

After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money, and gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all of his money. That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy, with his puppet body lying lifeless on a chair. The Fairy has also left him a new suit, boots, and a bag which contains 40 gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health.

The Adventures of Pinocchioincorporates elements similar to that offairy tales, as it is a story about an animated puppet and boys who turn into donkeys. The story is set in theTuscanarea of Italy, and featuresItalian languagepeppered withFlorentine dialectfeatures, such as theprotagonist's Florentine name.

As a young man, Collodi joined the seminary. However, the cause ofItalian unification(Risorgimento) usurped his calling, as he took to journalism as a means of supporting the Risorgimento in its struggle with theAustrian Empire.[7]In the 1850s, Collodi began to have a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books published. Once, he translated some French fairy-tales so well that he was asked whether he would like to write some of his own. In 1848, Collodi started publishingIl Lampione, a newspaper ofpolitical satire. With the founding of theKingdom of Italyin 1861, Collodi ceased his journalistic and militaristic activities and began writing children's books.[7]

Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recently unified Italy, includingViaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino(""Little Johnny's voyage through Italy""; 1876), a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, andMinuzzolo(1878).[8]In 1881, he sent a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet to a friend who edited a newspaper in Rome, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this ""bit of foolishness"" in his children's section. The editor did, and the children loved it.[9]

The Adventures of Pinocchiowas originally published in serial form in theGiornale per i bambini, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. In the original, serialized version, Pinocchio dies a gruesome death: hanged for his innumerable faults, at the end of Chapter 15. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16–36, in whichthe Fairy with Turquoise Hairrescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy, when he acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story more suitable for children. In the second half of the book, the maternal figure of the Blue-haired Fairy is the dominant character, versus the paternal figure of Geppetto in the first part. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book with huge success.[1]

Children's literature was a new idea in Collodi's time, an innovation in the 19th century. Thus in content and style it was new and modern, opening the way to many writers of the following century.

The Adventures of Pinocchiois the world'sthird most translated book(240–260 languages),[3][4]and was the first work of Italian children's literature to achieve international fame.[10]The book has had great impact on world culture, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide. The title character is acultural iconand one of the most reimagined characters in children's literature.[11]The popularity of the story was bolstered by the powerful philosopher-criticBenedetto Croce, who greatly admired the tale and reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature.[2]

Carlo Collodi, who died in 1890, was respected during his lifetime as a talented writer and social commentator, and his fame continued to grow whenPinocchiowas first translated into English byMary Alice Murrayin 1892, whose translation was added to the widely readEveryman's Libraryin 1911. Other well regarded English translations include the 1926 translation byCarol Della Chiesa, and the 1986 bilingual edition byNicolas J. Perella. The first appearance of the book in the United States was in 1898, with publication of the first US edition in 1901, translated and illustrated by Walter S. Cramp andCharles Copeland.[1]From that time, the story was one of the most famous children's books in the United States and an important step for many illustrators.[1]

Together with those from the United Kingdom, the American editions contributed to the popularity of Pinocchio in countries more culturally distant from Italy, such as Iceland and Asian countries.[1]In 1905,Otto Julius Bierbaumpublished a new version of the book in Germany, entitledZapfelkerns Abenteuer(lit.The Adventures of Pine Nut), and the first French edition was published in 1902. Between 1911 and 1945, translations were made into all European languages and several languages of Asia, Africa and Oceania.[12][1]In 1936, Soviet writerAleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoypublished a reworked version of Pinocchio titledThe Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino(originally a character in thecommedia dell'arte), which became one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature.

The first stage adaptation was launched in 1899, written by Gattesco Gatteschi and Enrico Guidotti and directed by Luigi Rasi.[1]Also, Pinocchio was adopted as a pioneer of cinema: in 1911,Giulio Antamorofeatured him in a 45-minute hand-coloured silent film starring Polidor (an almost complete version of the film was restored in the 1990s).[1]In 1932,Noburō Ōfujidirected a Japanese movie with an experimental technique using animated puppets,[1]while in the 1930s in Italy, there was an attempt to produce a full-length animated cartoon film of thesame title. The 1940Walt Disney versionwas a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.

Before writingPinocchio, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recentlyunified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titledViaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino(""Little Johnny's voyage through Italy"").[8]ThroughoutPinocchio, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun.

The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folk-tales of peasants who venture out into the world but are naively unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations.[13]At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from theindustrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was theemigrationof much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries, often as far away as South and North America.

Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. According to Thomas J. Morrissey and Richard Wunderlich inDeath and Rebirth in Pinocchio(1983) ""such mythological events probably imitate the annual cycle of vegetative birth, death, and renascence, and they often serve as paradigms for the frequent symbolic deaths and rebirths encountered in literature. Two such symbolic renderings are most prominent: re-emergence from a journey to hell and rebirth through metamorphosis.Journeys to the underworldare a common feature of Eurasian literary epics:Gilgamesh,Odysseus,Aeneas, andDanteall benefit from the knowledge and power they put on after such descents. Rebirth through metamorphosis, on the other hand, is a motif generally consigned to fantasy or speculative literature [...] These two figurative manifestations of the death-rebirth trope are rarely combined; however, Carlo Collodi's great fantasy-epic,The Adventures of Pinocchio, is a work in which a hero experiences symbolic death and rebirth through both infernal descent and metamorphosis. Pinocchio is truly a fantasy hero of epic proportions [...] Beneath the book's comic-fantasy texture—but not far beneath—lies a symbolic journey to the underworld, from which Pinocchio emerges whole.""[14]

The main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study. And in the end Pinocchio's willingness to provide for his father and devote himself to these things transforms him into a real boy with modern comforts. ""as a hero of what is, in the classic sense, a comedy,Pinocchiois protected from ultimate catastrophe, although he suffers quite a few moderate calamities. Collodi never lets the reader forget that disaster is always a possibility; in fact, that is just what Pinocchio's mentors —Geppetto, the Talking Cricket, and the Fairy— repeatedly tell him. Although they are part of a comedy, Pinocchio's adventures are not always funny. Indeed, they are sometimes sinister. The book's fictive world does not exclude injury, pain, or even death—they are stylized but not absent. [...] Accommodate them he does, by using the archetypal birth-death-rebirth motif as a means of structuring his hero's growth to responsible boyhood. Of course, the success of the puppet's growth is rendered in terms of his metamorphic rebirth as a flesh-and-blood human.""[14]"

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/102,The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudd%27nhead_Wilson,"The setting is the fictional frontier town of Dawson's Landing on the banks of the Mississippi River in the first half of the 19th century. David Wilson, a young lawyer, moves to town, and a clever remark of his is misunderstood, which causes locals to brand him a ""pudd'nhead"" (nitwit). His hobby of collectingfingerprintsdoes not raise his standing in the eyes of the townsfolk, who consider him to be eccentric and do not frequent his law practice.

""Pudd'nhead"" Wilson is left in the background as the focus shifts to theslaveRoxy, her son, and the family they serve. Roxy is one-sixteenth black and majority white, and her son, Valet de Chambre (referred to as Chambers), is 1/32 black. Roxy is principally charged with caring for her inattentive master's infant son, Tom Driscoll, who is the same age as her own son. After fellow slaves are caught stealing and are nearly sold ""down the river"" to a master in the Deep South, Roxy fears for her son and herself. She considers killing her boy and herself but decides to switch Chambers and Tom in their cribs to give her son a life of freedom and privilege.

The narrative moves forward two decades. Tom Driscoll (formerly Valet de Chambre) has been raised to believe that he is white and has become a spoiled aristocrat. He is a selfish and dissolute young man. Tom's father has died and granted Roxy her freedom in his will. She worked for a time on riverboats and saved money for her retirement. When she finally is able to retire, she discovers that her bank has failed and all of her savings are gone. She returns to Dawson's Landing to ask for money from Tom.

Tom responds to Roxy with derision. She tells him the truth about his ancestry and that he is her son and partially black; she blackmails him into financially supporting her.

Twin Italian noblemen visit Dawson's Landing to some fanfare, and Tom quarrels with one. Desperate for money, Tom robs and murders his wealthy uncle, and the blame falls wrongly on one of the Italians. From that point, the novel proceeds as a crime novel. In a courtroom scene, the whole mystery is solved when Wilson demonstrates, through fingerprints, that Tom is both the murderer and not the true Driscoll heir.

Although the real Tom Driscoll's rights are restored, his life changes for the worse. Having been raised as a slave, he feels intensely uneasy in white society. At the same time, as a white man, he is essentially excluded from the company of blacks.

In a final twist, the creditors of Tom's father's estate successfully petition the governor to have Tom's (Chambers) prison sentence overturned. Shown to be born to a slave mother, he is classified as a slave and is legally included among the property assets of the estate. He is sold ""down the river"", helping the creditors recoup their losses.

Mark Twain's satire humorously and pointedly lambastes everything from small-town politics and religious beliefs toslaveryand racism.[2]

David Wilson makes a joke that is misunderstood by the townsfolk of Dawson's Landing, who take Wilson's words literally. They consider the subtle, intelligent Wilson to be a simpleton.[2]Word of the joke spreads quickly, and Wilson becomes known as ""Pudd'nhead"" for being a fool in the eyes of the townspeople.

The first part of the book seems to satirize racism in antebellum Missouri by exposing the fragility of the dividing line between white and black. The new Tom Driscoll is accepted by a family withhigh Virginian ancestryas its own, and he grows up to be corrupt, self-interested, and distasteful.[2]The reader does not know, at the end of the story, whether Tom's behavior results fromnature or nurture. Naturalistic readings risk framing the story as a vindication of racism based on biological differences too subtle to be seen. (The essentialism is not reciprocal, however. Chambers adapts well to life as a slave and fails to successfully assume his proper place as a high-class white.)[3]

The novel features thetechnological innovationof the use of fingerprints as forensic evidence. ""The reader knows from the beginning who committed the murder, and the story foreshadows how the crime will be solved. The circumstances of the denouement, however, possessed in its time great novelty, for fingerprinting had not then come into official use in crime detection in the United States. Even a man who fooled around with it as a hobby was thought to be a simpleton, a 'pudd'nhead'.""[4]

Roxana is a slave, originally owned by Percy Driscoll and freed upon his death. Roxy is1⁄16black, or 15/16 white. With a fair complexion, brown eyes, and straight brown hair, she looks more white than black, which makes sense based on her ancestry. Since she was born into slavery, she is still considered a slave and is associated with blacks. She identifies as black and speaks the dialect of slaves in the antebellum Deep South. She is the mother of Valet de Chambre and acts as a nanny to Thomas Driscoll. Due to her son's overwhelming percentage of European ancestry and appearance, she switches him with Driscoll's son when the boys are infants, hoping to guarantee Chambers's freedom and an upper-class upbringing.

Thomas à Becket Driscoll is the son of Percy Driscoll. Tom is switched with Roxy's baby, Chambers, when he is a few months old and is called ""Chambers"" from then on. Raised as a slave, Chambers is purchased by his uncle Judge Driscoll after his brother Percy dies. The judge is childless and sad and wants to prevent the young man Tom Driscoll from selling Chambers downriver. Chambers is portrayed as a decent young man whom Tom forces to fight bullies. He is kind and always respectful toward Tom but receives brutal treatment by his master. He shares diction with other slaves.

Valet de Chambre is Roxy's son. Chambers is1⁄32black and as Roxy's son, was born into slavery. At a young age, he is switched by his mother with Thomas à Becket Driscoll, a white child of the same age born into an aristocratic family in the small town. From then on, he is known as ""Tom"" and is raised as the white heir to a large estate.  Tom is spoiled, cruel, and wicked. In his early years, he has an intense hate for Chambers, although the other boy protects Tom and saves his life on numerous occasions. Tom attends Yale University for two years and returns to Dawson's Landing with ""Eastern polish"", which results in the locals disliking him more.

Tom is portrayed as the embodiment of human folly. His weakness for gambling leads him into debt. After his father's death, he is adopted by his uncle, Judge Driscoll, who frequently disinherits him, only to rewrite his will again to include him.

Luigi and Angelo Capello, a set of near-identical twins, appear in Dawson's Landing in reply to an ad placed by Aunt Patsy, who is looking for a boarder. They say they want to relax after years of traveling the world. They claim to be the children of an Italian nobleman who was forced to flee Italy with his wife after a revolution. He died soon afterward, followed by his wife. One of the twins, who is said to have killed a man, kicks Tom because he makes a joke about him at a town meeting. As a result, Judge Driscoll challenges the twin, Luigi, to a duel.

Wilson is a lawyer who came to Dawson's Landing to practice law but was unable to succeed at his law practice after alienating the locals. He establishes a comfortable life in the town, working as a bookkeeper and pursuing his hobby of collecting fingerprints. Although the title character, he remains in the background of the novel until the final chapters.

Each chapter begins with clever quotations from Pudd’nhead Wilson’sCalendar, a project of Wilson's that endears him to Judge Driscoll but further confirms everyone else's opinion of him as a ""pudd’nhead"".[5]

Twain originally envisioned the characters of Luigi and Angelo Capello asconjoined twins, modeled after the late-19th-century conjoined twinsGiovanni and Giacomo Tocci. He planned for them to be the central characters of a novel to be titledThose Extraordinary Twins.

During the writing process, however, Twain realized that secondary characters such as Pudd'nhead Wilson, Roxy, and Tom Driscoll were taking a more central role in the story. More importantly, he found that the serious tone of the story of Roxy and Tom clashed unpleasantly with the light tone of the twins' story. As he explains in the introduction to ""Those Extraordinary Twins"":

The characters of Luigi and Angelo remain inPudd'nhead Wilson, as twins with separate bodies. Twain was not thorough in his separation of the twins, and there are hints in the final version of their conjoined origin, such as the fact that they were their parents' ""only child"", they sleep together, they play piano together, and they had an early career as sideshow performers.

""Those Extraordinary Twins"" was published as a short story, with glosses inserted into the text where the narrative was either unfinished or would have duplicated parts ofPudd'nhead Wilson.[6]

F R Leaviswas influential in his reassessment of the novel.[citation needed]

Frank M. Mayoproduced a theatrical adaptation in 1895 and played Wilson.

Afilm in 1916and a TV movie in 1984 were based on the book.[7]

The 1993The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.episode ""Brisco for the Defense"" is loosely based on the novel, which is featured as the inspiration for the final twist. However, the episode takes place in 1893, a year before the book was published in novel form."

Fiction,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23936,Treasure Island,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island,"In the mid-18th century, an old sailor who identifies himself as ""The Captain"" starts to lodge at the rural Admiral Benbow Inn nearBristol. He tells the innkeeper's son,Jim Hawkins, to keep a lookout for ""a one-legged seafaring man"".

Black Dog, a pirate with missing fingers, recognises the captain as his former shipmate Billy Bones, and confronts him. They get into a cutlass fight; Black Dog flees, and Bones suffers a stroke. That night, Jim's father dies. Days later, Pew, a blind beggar, visits the inn, delivering a summons to Bones called ""the black spot"". Shortly thereafter, Bones suffers another stroke and dies.

Pew and his accomplices attack the inn but are attacked and routed by mounted excise officers, and Pew is trampled to death by one of their horses. Jim and his mother escape with a packet from The Captain's sea chest, which is found to contain a map of the island on which the infamous pirateCaptain Flinthid his treasure. Jim shows the map to the local physicianDr. LiveseyandSquire Trelawney, and they decide to make an expedition to the island, with Jim serving as a cabin boy.

They set sail from Bristol on aschoonerchartered by Trelawney, theHispaniola, underCaptain Alexander Smollett. Jim forms a strong bond with the ship's one-legged cook,Long John Silver. The crew suffers a tragedy when first mate Mr. Arrow, a drunkard, is washed overboard during a storm. While hidden in an apple barrel, Jim overhears a conversation among theHispaniola's crew which reveals that many of them are pirates who had served on Captain Flint's ship, theWalrus, with Silver leading them. They plan to mutiny after the salvage of the treasure, and to murder the captain and the few remaining loyal crew. Jim secretly informs Captain Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey.

Arriving at the island and going ashore, Jim flees into the jungle after witnessing Silver murder a sailor for objections. He meets a marooned pirate namedBen Gunn, who is also a former member of Flint's crew. The mutineers arm themselves and take the ship, while Jim and Smollett's loyal band take refuge in an abandoned stockade on the island. After a brief truce, the mutineers attack the stockade, with casualties on both sides of the battle. Jim makes his way to theHispaniolaand cuts the ship from its anchor, drifting it along the ebb tide. He boards the ship and encounters the pirate Israel Hands, who had been injured in a drunken dispute with one of his companions. Hands helps Jim beach the schooner in the northern bay, then attempts to kill Jim with a dagger, but Jim shoots him dead with two pistols.

Jim goes ashore and returns to the stockade, where he is horrified to find only Silver and the pirates. Silver tells Jim that when everyone found the ship was gone, Captain Smollett's party had agreed to a truce whereby the pirates take the map and allow the besieged party to leave. In the morning, Livesey arrives to treat the wounded and sick pirates, and tells Silver to look out for trouble once he's found the site of the treasure. After a dispute over leadership, Silver and the others set out with the map, taking Jim along as a hostage. They find a skeleton with its arms oriented toward the treasure, unnerving the party. Ben Gunn shouts Captain Flint's last words from the forest, making the superstitious pirates believe that Flint's ghost is haunting the island. They eventually find a treasure cache, but it is empty. The pirates prepare to kill Silver and Jim, but they are driven off by the doctor's party, including Gunn. Livesey explains that Gunn had already found the bulk of the treasure and taken it to his cave, long ago. The expedition members load this portion of the treasure onto theHispaniolaand depart the island, with Silver as their only prisoner. At their first port, inSpanish America, Silver steals a bag of money and escapes. The remaining crew sail back toBristoland divide up the treasure. Some treasure was never found, but Jim refuses to return to the ""accursed"" island to look for it.

Treasure Islandwas written by Stevenson after returning from his first trip to America where he was married. Still a relatively unknown author, inspiration came in summer of 1881 inBraemar, Scotland when bad weather kept the family inside.[3]To amuse his 12-year old stepson,Lloyd Osbourne, he used the idea of a secret map as the basis of a story about hidden treasure.

He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, ""If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the Devon coast, that it's all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It's quite silly and horrid fun – and what I want is thebestbook about Buccaneers that can be had.""[4]

Stevenson originally gave the book the titleThe Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of theYoung Folksmagazine.[5]After completing several chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness.[6]He left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. The book was later republished as the novelTreasure Islandand proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success.

The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 whenDaniel Defoe'sRobinson Crusoewas published. A century later, novels such asS. H. Burney'sThe Shipwreck(1816), andSir Walter Scott'sThe Pirate(1822) continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors in the mid-19th century continued this trend, with works includingJames Fenimore Cooper'sThe Pilot(1823). During the same period,Edgar Allan Poewrote ""MS Found in a Bottle"" (1833) and ""The Gold-Bug"" (1843). All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product.[7]

Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a letter from July 1884 toSidney Colvin, he wrote that, ""Treasure Islandcame out ofKingsley'sAt Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest — and that was the seed — and out of the greatCaptain Johnson'sHistory of the Notorious Pirates."" Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton fromPoe'sThe Gold-Bugand he constructedBilly Bones's history from the ""Money-Diggers"" section (""Golden Dreams"" in particular[8]) ofTales of a TravellerbyWashington Irving, one of his favourite writers.[9]"

During the annualCarnivalseason, Montresor finds a drunken Fortunato and asks for his help in authenticating a recently purchasedpipe(about 130 gallons, or 492 litres) of what has been described to him as Amontillado wine. As the two descend to the wine cellars and catacombs beneath Montresor's home, Montresor expresses concern over Fortunato's persistent cough and the effect that the dampness will have on his health. Undeterred, Fortunato presses on, intent on sampling the Amontillado, and Montresor gives him more wine to keep him inebriated. Montresor describes his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the mottoNemo me impune lacessit(""No one provokes me with impunity""). At one point, Fortunato makes a gesture that Montresor does not recognize and deduces that Montresor is not a mason. Montresor shows him atrowelas a joke, deliberately confusingFreemasonrywith the profession ofstonemasonry.

They arrive at a niche deep within the catacombs, where Montresor claims the Amontillado is stored. When Fortunato ventures inside, Montresor chains him to the wall, having devised the Amontillado ruse to lure him into this trap. Montresor sets to work walling up the niche, using supplies of stone and mortar he had previously hidden nearby. Fortunato quickly sobers up and tries to escape, but Montresor mocks his cries for help, knowing that no one can hear them. While Montresor continues to work, Fortunato tries to persuade Montresor to release him, first by suggesting that they treat the incident as a practical joke, and finally making a last desperate plea. As he falls silent, Montresor completes the wall and moves a pile of bones to hide it, feeling a sickness of heart that he dismisses as a reaction to the dampness of the catacombs.

Stating that the niche and Fortunato's body have stood undisturbed for 50 years, Montresor concludes his account by saying, ""In pace requiescat!"" (""May he rest in peace!"").

""The Cask of Amontillado"" was first published in the November 1846 issue ofGodey's Lady's Book,[1]which was, at the time, the most popular periodical in America.[2]The story was only published one additional time during Poe's life, in the November 14, 1846,New England Weekly Review.[3]

Although the subject matter of Poe's story is a murder, ""The Cask of Amontillado"" is not a tale of detection like ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" or ""The Purloined Letter""; there is no investigation of Montresor's crime and the criminal himself explains how he committed the murder. The mystery in ""The Cask of Amontillado"" is in Montresor's motive for murder. Without a detective in the story, it is up to the reader to solve the mystery.[4]From the beginning of the story, it is made clear that Montresor has exaggerated his grievances towards Fortunato. The reader is led to assume that much like his exaggerated grievances, the punishment he chooses will represent what he believes is equal justice, and in turn, going to the extreme.[5]

Montresor never specifies his motive beyond the vague ""thousand injuries"" and ""when he ventured upon insult"" to which he refers. Some context is provided, including Montresor's observation that his family once was great (but no longer so), and Fortunato's belittling remarks about Montresor's exclusion fromFreemasonry. Many commentators conclude that, lacking significant reason, Montresor must beinsane, though even this is questionable because of the intricate details of the plot.[4]

There is also evidence that Montresor is almost as clueless about his motive for revenge as his victim.[6]In his recounting of the murder, Montresor notes, ""A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong"". After Fortunato is chained to the wall and nearly entombed alive, Montresor merely mocks and mimics him, rather than disclosing to Fortunato the reasons behind his exacting revenge. Montresor may not have been entirely certain of the exact nature of the insults for which he expected Fortunato to atone.[6]

Additional scrutiny into the vague injuries and insults may have to do with a simple matter of Montresor's pride and not any specific words from Fortunato.[7]Montresor comes from an established family. His house had once been noble and respected, but has fallen slightly in status. Fortunato, as his name would seem to indicate, has been blessed with good fortune and wealth and is, therefore, viewed as unrefined by Montresor; however, this lack of refinement has not stopped Fortunato from surpassing Montresor in society, which could very well be the ""insult"" motive for Montresor's revenge.[7]

There is indication that Montresor blames his unhappiness and loss of respect and dignity within society on Fortunato.[8]It is easy to ascertain that Fortunato is a Freemason, while Montresor is not, which could be the source of Fortunato's recent ascension into upper class society. Montresor even imparts this blame to Fortunato when he states, ""You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was"". This interchanging of fortunes is a suggestion that, since the names Montresor and Fortunato mirror one another, there is a psychological reciprocal identification between victim and executioner.[8]This identification reciprocity is further suggested when one takes into consideration that Montresor entombs Fortunato in the Montresor family catacombs rather than dispatching him elsewhere in the city amidst the chaos of the Carnival. It is with this converging of the two characters that one is able to see the larger symbolism of the Montresor crest – the foot steps on the serpent while the serpent forever has his fangs embedded in the heel.[8]

Upon further investigation into the true nature of character, double meaning can be derived from the Montresor crest.[6]It is the position of Montresor to view himself as the owner of the righteous foot that is crushing the insolent Fortunato serpent and his ""thousand injuries"" that progress into insult. A more allegoric meaning of Poe's places the actors in reverse.[6]The blind oaf Fortunato has unintentionally stepped upon the snake in the grass – the sneaky and cunning Montresor – who, as a reward for this accidental bruising, sinks his fangs deep into the heel of his offender, forever linking them in a form of mutual existence.[6]

Though Fortunato is presented as aconnoisseurof fine wine, his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado fromsherrywhen amontillado is in fact a type of sherry, and treatsDe Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Because intoxication interferes with critical evaluation, and would be avoided by a connoisseur during a wine tasting, it is implied within the story that Fortunato is merely analcoholic. Under this interpretation, Fortunato's fate could also have been retribution for wasting a bottle of fine wine.[9]

Immurement, a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exit, is featured in several other works by Poe, including ""The Fall of the House of Usher"", ""The Premature Burial"", ""The Black Cat"", and ""Berenice"".

Anapocryphallegend holds that the inspiration for ""The Cask of Amontillado"" came from a story Poe had heard atCastle Island(South Boston),Massachusetts, when he was a private stationed atFort Independencein 1827.[10]According to this legend, he saw a monument to Lieutenant Robert Massie. Historically, Massie had been killed in a sword duel onChristmas Day1817 by Lieutenant Gustavus Drane, following a dispute during a card game.[11]The legend states other soldiers then took revenge on Drane by getting him drunk, luring him into the dungeon, chaining him to a wall, and sealing him in a vault.[12]This version of Drane's demise is false; Drane wascourtmartialledfor the killing andacquitted,[11]and lived until 1846.[13]A report of a skeleton discovered on the island may be a confused remembering of Poe's major source,Joel Headley's ""A Man Built in a Wall"",[14]which recounts the author's seeing animmuredskeleton in the wall of a church in Italy.[15]Headley's story includes details very similar to ""The Cask of Amontillado""; in addition to walling an enemy into a hidden niche, the story details the careful placement of the bricks, the motive of revenge, and the victim's agonized moaning. Poe may have also seen similar themes inHonoré de Balzac'sLa Grande Bretèche(Democratic Review, November 1843) or his friendGeorge Lippard'sThe Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall(1845).[16]Poe may have borrowed Montresor's family mottoNemo me impune lacessitfromJames Fenimore Cooper, who used the line inThe Last of the Mohicans(1826).[17]

Poe wrote his tale, however, as a response to his personal rivalThomas Dunn English. Poe and English had several confrontations, usually revolving around literary caricatures of one another. Poe thought that one of English's writings went a bit too far, and successfully sued the other man's editors at theNew York Mirrorforlibelin 1846.[18]That year, English published a revenge-based novel called1844, or, The Power of the S.F.Its plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, but made references tosecret societiesand ultimately had a main theme of revenge. It included a character named Marmaduke Hammerhead, the famous author of ""The Black Crow"", who uses phrases like ""Nevermore"" and ""lost Lenore"", referring to Poe's poem ""The Raven"". This parody of Poe was depicted as a drunkard, liar, and anabusivelover.

Poe responded with ""The Cask of Amontillado"", using very specific references to English's novel. In Poe's story, for example, Fortunato makes reference to the secret society ofMasons, similar to the secret society in1844, and even makes a gesture similar to one portrayed in1844(it was a signal of distress). English had also used an image of a token with a hawk grasping a snake in its claws, similar to Montresor's coat of arms bearing a foot stomping on a snake – though in this image, the snake is biting the heel. In fact, much of the scene of ""The Cask of Amontillado"" comes from a scene in1844that takes place in a subterranean vault. In the end, then, it is Poe who ""punishes with impunity"" by not taking credit for his own literary revenge and by crafting a concise tale (as opposed to a novel) with a singular effect, as he had suggested in his essay ""The Philosophy of Composition"".[19]

Poe may have also been inspired, at least in part, by theWashingtonian movement, a fellowship that promotedtemperance. The group was made up of reformed drinkers who tried to scare people into abstaining from alcohol. Poe may have made a promise to join the movement in 1843 after a bout of drinking with the hopes of gaining a political appointment. ""The Cask of Amontillado"" then may be a ""dark temperance tale"", meant to shock people into realizing the dangers of drinking.[20]

Poe scholar Richard P. Benton has stated his belief that ""Poe's protagonist is an Englished version of theFrenchMontrésor"" and has argued forcefully that Poe's model for Montresor ""wasClaude de Bourdeille, comte de Montrésor(Count of Montrésor), the 17th-century political conspirator in the entourage ofKing Louis XIII's weak-willed brother,Gaston d'Orléans"".[21]The ""noted intriguer and memoir-writer"" was first linked to ""The Cask of Amontillado"" by Poe scholar Burton R. Pollin.[21][22]

Further inspiration for the method of Fortunato's murder comes from the fear of live burial. During the time period of this short story some coffins were given methods of alerting the outside in the event of live entombment. Items such as bells tied to the limbs of a corpse to signal the outside were not uncommon. This theme is evident in Fortunato's costume of ajesterwith bells upon his hat, and his situation of live entombment within the catacombs.[8]

Poe may have known bricklaying through personal experience. Many periods in Poe's life lack significant biographical details, including what he did after leaving theSouthern Literary Messengerin 1837.[23]Poe biographer John H. Ingram wrote toSarah Helen Whitmanthat someone named ""Allen"" said that Poe worked ""in the brickyard 'late in the fall of 1834'"". This source has been identified as Robert T. P. Allen, a fellowWest Pointstudent during Poe's time there.[24]"
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/558,The Thirty-Nine Steps,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Nine_Steps,"The story's narrator, Richard Hannay, arrives in London fromRhodesiaearly in 1914, having made a modest fortune as a mining engineer. Disillusioned with his uneventful life as a man about town, he is on the brink of resolving to leave England for good when a panicked neighbour, Franklin Scudder, knocks at the door of his flat inPortland Place. Scudder is a freelance journalist who claims to have uncovered a plot against the Premier of Greece, Constantine Karolides. According to Scudder, Karolides is to be assassinated in London in a few weeks' time, on 15 June, an event which the plotters hope will trigger war in Europe.

Fearing for his life, Scudder has gone to the trouble of faking his own death, and needs to disappear from view. Hannay permits him to hide in his flat, and is horrified when a few days later he returns to find Scudder with a knife through his heart, now truly dead. Determined to warn the government of the plot, but unwilling to go to the police for fear of being arrested for murder, Hannay escapes the building disguised as amilkmanand takes a train to Scotland, intending to find a remote area where he can lie low. He takes with him the coded notebook in which Scudder had recorded his findings.

Hannay alights at a rural station in theGalloway Hills, and a cat-and-mouse chase ensues as he evades both the plotters, who attempt to spot him on the open hillside from an aeroplane, and the police. Deciphering Scudder's notes, he learns that his adversaries are members of a German spy ring known as the ""Black Stone"" whose goal is to steal Britain's naval defence plans before war breaks out. Hannay meets Sir Harry, landowner and local parliamentary candidate, and takes him into his confidence. Sir Harry promises to write to his godfather, Sir Walter Bullivant,Permanent Secretaryat theForeign Office, to warn him of the plot.

Narrowly avoiding his pursuers, Hannay stumbles into a lonely cottage and finds himself face to face with the Black Stone's leader. Hannay's lies are convincing enough to leave the spies in doubt as to his true identity, and they lock him in a storeroom rather than killing him outright. Finding a cabinet full of explosives, Hannay uses his experience as a mining engineer to escape by blowing the window from its frame. Eventually he manages to catch a train south, hoping to find Sir Walter Bullivant at his home inBerkshire.

Sir Walter accepts the bulk of Hannay's story, but doubts that Karolides' life is in danger. An urgent government phone call, however, informs him that Karolides is already dead. The two men travel to London, where Sir Walter is to host a high-level official meeting at hiscitytownhouse. Hannay, now cleared of the Portland Place murder, is left to his own devices, but a general feeling of unease prompts him to call at Sir Walter's house. He arrives just in time to see theFirst Sea Lordleaving; their eyes briefly meet, and Hannay recognizes him as one of the spies in disguise. Hannay breaks into the meeting, but by the time the deception is confirmed the man has long gone, taking with him the naval secrets he has just learned.

Realising that the spies will have to cross theChannelto get their information back to Germany, Hannay and the meeting attendees comb Scudder's notebook for clues as to the planned point of departure. An entry reading ""Thirty-nine steps — I counted them — High tide, 10.17 p.m."" leads them to a clifftop villa inKentwith a private flight of steps — 39 in total — running down to the sea. A yacht waits offshore. Hannay confronts the occupants of the villa and is mortified to find what appears to be a perfectly ordinary group of English friends who have been enjoying a game of tennis in the sun. But then one of the men droops his eyelids in a characteristic gesture that Hannay recognizes — it is the owner of the cottage in Scotland. Hannay blows his whistle, and the spies are arrested before they can reach the yacht. Britain enters theGreat Warseven weeks later, and Hannay is commissioned as a captain in the army. He comments, ""But I had done my best service, I think, before I put onkhaki.""[5]

John BuchanwroteThe Thirty-Nine Stepswhile he was ill in bed with aduodenal ulcer, an illness which remained with him all his life. Buchan's sonWilliamlater wrote that the name of the book originated when the author's daughter was counting the stairs at St Cuby, a private nursing home on Cliff Promenade inBroadstairs, where Buchan was convalescing. ""There was a wooden staircase leading down to the beach. My sister, who was about six, and who had just learnt to count properly, went down them and gleefully announced: there are 39 steps."" The tunnelled stairway through the cliff actually consisted of 78 steps, but Buchan halved the number to make a better title. When the original oak steps were later replaced, one of them, complete with a brass plaque, was sent to Buchan.[6]The concrete steps now number 108, still running from the garden to the beach.[7]

This novel was his first ""shocker"", as he called it — a story combining personal and political dramas. It marked a turning point in Buchan's literary career and introduced his adventuring heroRichard Hannay. He described a ""shocker"" as an adventure where the events in the story are unlikely and the reader is only just able to believe that they really happened.[6]

Buchan dedicated the novel to his friendThomas Arthur Nelson, saying ""My Dear Tommy, / You and I have long cherished an affection for that elemental type of tale which Americans call the 'dime novel' and which we know as the 'shocker' — the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities, and march just inside the borders of the possible. During an illness last winter I exhausted my store of those aids to cheerfulness, and was driven to write one for myself. This little volume is the result, and I should like to put your name on it in memory of our long friendship, in the days when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than the facts.[8]

The Thirty-Nine Stepsis one of the earliest examples of the '""man-on-the-run"" thrillerarchetypesubsequently adopted by film makers as a much-used plot device. InThe Thirty-Nine Steps, Buchan holds up Richard Hannay as an example to his readers of an ordinary man who puts his country's interests before his own safety. The story was a great success with the men in the First World Wartrenches. One soldier wrote to Buchan, ""The story is greatly appreciated in the midst of mud and rain and shells, and all that could make trench life depressing.""[9]

Hannay continued his adventures in four subsequent books. Two were set during the war, when he continued his undercover work against the Germans and their allies theTurksinGreenmantle(1916) andMr Standfast(1919). The other two stories,The Three Hostages(1924) andThe Island of Sheep(1936) were set in the postwar period, when Hannay's opponents werecriminalgangs.

The novel has been adapted for multiple media; many of these versions depart significantly from the text – for example, by introducing a love interest absent from the original novel and inspired by Hitchcock's film. In most cases, the title is often abbreviated toThe 39 Steps, but the full title is more commonly used for the book and 1978 film adaptation.[2]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1155,The Secret Adversary,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Adversary,"In 1920 London, demobilised soldier Tommy Beresford reunites with his childhood friend and war volunteer Prudence ""Tuppence"" Cowley. In passing, he mentions that he overheard a man mention the name ""Jane Finn,"" which he finds ridiculous.  Out of work and money, they form ""The Young Adventurers, Ltd"".

Their first client, a Mr Whittington, makes Tuppence a suspiciously generous offer. Remembering Tommy's anecdote, when Whittington asks Tuppence her name, she gives him the alias ""Jane Finn."" A shocked Whittington offers her £50hush moneyand asks her to return the following day, but when she returns, the office has been suddenly closed. They decide to advertise for information about ""Jane Finn,"" and receive two replies, from a Mr. Carter, and from Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.

Carter, who Tommy recognizes from his wartime service in British intelligence, tells them that Jane Finn is believed to have received a secret treaty from a British agent during the sinking ofRMSLusitaniain May 1915, as she wasmore likely to survive.  According to Mr. Carter, if the terms of the treaty were disclosed, it would cause the government to fall and precipitate a general strike.  Mr. Carter hires Tommy and Tuppence to find her, but Carter warns them about an enemy agent known only as ""Mr Brown.""

They then get in touch with Julius Hersheimmer, who turns out to be an American multimillionaire, and Jane Finn's cousin, who has come to London to find her.

Tommy and Tuppence's investigation leads them to the home of Mrs Marguerite ""Rita"" Vandemeyer, a woman with several powerful friends, including Whittington and Sir James Peel Edgerton,K C. Under cover, Tuppence obtains a job as Mrs Vandemeyer's maid and enlists the help of a young boy working there named Albert. Edgerton cryptically suggests that Tuppence might be better off working for someone else. This leads Tommy and Tuppence to go to Edgerton's office to ask about the remark.  When Tuppence resumes her disguise and returns to Vandemeyer's house, Vandemeyer discovers her deception, and holds her at gunpoint, until Tuppence wrests the gun away.  Tuppence offers Vandemeyer a large bribe to tell the whereabouts of Jane Finn, but she screamed and fainted after seeing Hersheimmer and Edgerton. They leave her in her bed but lock her in her room because of their fear of Mr. Brown, but when they return in the morning, Vandemeyer is found dead.

Meanwhile, Tommy follows Boris Ivanovitch, another of Rita's associates, to a house inSoho, where Tommy is taken prisoner while attempting to eavesdrop on a meeting ofBolshevistconspirators. A young French woman at the house, Annette, arranges his escape, but refuses to leave herself. Tommy returns to the Ritz and finds Tuppence.

Sir James discovers Jane Finn, who has recovered her memory after an accident. She tells them where she hid the treaty, but they find instead a message from Mr Brown. While searching for writing paper in Julius's drawer, Tommy finds a photograph of Annette. Tommy concludes that Annette is the real Jane Finn and the Jane Finn they met was a plant to stop their investigation. He gets an original copy of the telegram sent to Tuppence and sees that her destination was altered on the copy he read. Tommy and Albert proceed to the correct destination.

Hersheimmer arranges for the release of Tuppence and Annette. At Sir James's residence, Jane tells her story: after receiving the packet, she became suspicious of Mrs Vandemeyer. Jane placed blank sheets in the original packet, sealing the treaty inside magazine pages. Travelling from Ireland, she was mugged and taken to the house in Soho. Perceiving the intent of her captors, Jane faked amnesia, conversing only in French. She hid the treaty in a picture frame in her room and has maintained her role as ""Annette"" ever since. Tuppence suspects that Hersheimmer is Mr Brown. Sir James agrees, adding that the real Hersheimmer was killed in America and that his imposter killed Mrs Vandemeyer. They rush to Soho, recovering the treaty at the house. Sir James identifies himself as the true Mr Brown, and announces his plan to kill them, wound himself, and then blame it on the elusive Mr Brown. Julius and Tommy, who are hiding in the room, overwhelm Sir James. He commits suicide using poison concealed in his ring, the compelling evidence to persuade Mr Carter of his old friend's guilt.

Tommy’s role in solving the mystery persuades his estranged rich uncle to support him financially and make Tommy his heir. The novel ends with both Hersheimmer and Jane, and Tommy and Tuppence, engaged to marry.

Upon publication of the first book edition it was reviewed byThe Times Literary Supplementin its edition of 26 January 1922, which described it as ""a whirl of thrilling adventures"". It stated that the characters of Tommy and Tuppence were ""refreshingly original"" and praised the fact that the ""identity of the arch-criminal, the elusive ""Mr Brown"", is cleverly concealed to the very end"".[4]

The critic forThe New York Times Book Review(11 June 1922) was also impressed: ""It is safe to assert that unless the reader peers into the last chapter or so of the tale, he will not know who this secret adversary is until the author chooses to reveal him."" The review gave something of a backhanded compliment when it said that Christie ""gives a sense of plausibility to the most preposterous situations and developments."" Nevertheless it conceded that

Robert Barnarddescribed the novel as ""The first and best (no extravagant compliment this) of the Tommy and Tuppence stories. It tells how the dauntless pair foils a plot to foment labour unrest and red revolution in Britain, masterminded by the man behind the Bolshevists. Good reactionary fun, if you're in that mood.""[6]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/564,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood,"The novel begins as John Jasper leaves a Londonopium den.[5]He is the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. The next evening, he is visited by his nephew, Edwin Drood. Edwin confides that he has misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud, which had been arranged by their fathers. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits. Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else.

Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena are sent to Cloisterham for their education. Neville will study with theminor canonthe Rev. Septimus Crisparkle; Helena will live at the Nuns' House with Rosa. Neville confides to Mr Crisparkle that he had hated his cruel stepfather, while Rosa confides to Helena that she loathes and fears Jasper, who is her music master. Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa and is indignant that Edwin treats his betrothal so lightly. Edwin provokes him and he reacts violently, which gives Jasper the opportunity to spread rumours that Neville has a violent temper. Mr Crisparkle tries to reconcile Edwin and Neville; Neville agrees to apologise to Edwin if Edwin will forgive him. It is arranged that they will dine together for this purpose on Christmas Eve at Jasper's home.

Rosa's guardian, Mr Grewgious, tells her that she has a substantial inheritance from her father. When she asks whether there would be any forfeiture if she did not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be none on either side. Back at his office in London, Mr Grewgious gives Edwin a ring which Rosa's father had given to her mother, with the proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his irrevocable commitment to her or return it to Mr Grewgious. Mr Bazzard, Mr Grewgious's clerk, witnesses this transaction.

Next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal.  They decide to ask Mr Grewgious to break the news to Jasper, and Edwin intends to return the ring to Mr Grewgious. Meanwhile, Durdles takes Jasper into the cathedralcrypt. On the way there Durdles points out a mound ofquicklime. Jasper provides Durdles with a bottle of wine. The wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles loses consciousness; while unconscious he dreams that Jasper goes off by himself in the crypt. As Jasper and Durdles return from the crypt, they encounter a boy called Deputy; Jasper, thinking he was spying on them, takes him by the throat but, realising that this will strangle him, lets him go.

On Christmas Eve, Neville buys himself a heavy walking stick; he plans to spend his Christmas break hiking in the countryside. Meanwhile, Edwin visits a jeweller to get his pocket watch repaired; it is mentioned that the only jewellery he wears is the watch and chain and a shirt pin. By chance he meets a woman who is an opium user from London. She asks Drood's Christian name and he replies that it is ""Edwin""; she says he is fortunate it is not ""Ned"", for ""Ned"" is in great danger. He thinks nothing of this, for the only person who calls him ""Ned"" is Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper buys himself a black scarf of strong silk, which is not seen again during the course of the novel. The reconciliation dinner is successful and at midnight Edwin Drood and Neville Landless leave together to go down to the river and look at a storm that rages that night.

The next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper encourages suspicions that Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for his hike; the townspeople overtake him and forcibly bring him back to the city. Mr Crisparkle keeps Neville out of jail by taking responsibility for him, stating that he will produce Neville any time his presence is required. That night, Jasper is strongly affected when Mr Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa have ended their betrothal; he reacts more strongly to this news than to the possibility that Edwin may be dead. The next morning, Mr Crisparkle goes to the riverweirand finds Edwin's watch and chain and shirt pin.

Half a year later, Neville is living in London near Mr Grewgious's office. Lieutenant Tartar introduces himself and offers to share his garden with Neville; Lt Tartar's chambers are adjacent to Neville's above a common courtyard.

A white-haired and whiskered stranger calling himself Dick Datchery arrives in Cloisterham. He rents a room below Jasper's and observes the comings and goings in the area. Going to his lodgings for the first time, Mr Datchery asks Deputy for directions. Deputy will not go near the lodgings for fear that Jasper will choke him again.

Jasper visits Rosa at the Nuns' House and professes his love for her. She rejects him but he persists, telling her that if she gives him no hope he will destroy Neville, the brother of her dear friend Helena. In fear of Jasper, Rosa flees to Mr Grewgious in London.

The next day Mr Crisparkle follows Rosa to London. While he is with her and Mr Grewgious, Lt Tartar calls and asks if he remembers him. Mr Crisparkle does remember him, as the person who years before saved him from drowning. They do not dare let Rosa contact Neville and Helena directly, for fear that Jasper may be watching Neville, but Lt Tartar allows Rosa to visit his chambers to contact Helena above the courtyard. Mr Grewgious arranges for Rosa to rent a place from Mrs Billickin and for Miss Twinkleton to live with her there for respectability.

Jasper visits the London opium den again for the first time since Edwin's disappearance. When he leaves, at dawn, the woman who runs the opium den follows him. She vows to herself that she will not lose his trail again, as she had done after his last visit. This time, she follows him all the way to his home in Cloisterham; outside it she meets Datchery, who tells her Jasper's name and that he will sing in the cathedral service the next morning. On inquiry, Datchery learns she is called ""Princess Puffer"". The next morning she attends the service and shakes her fists at Jasper from behind a pillar, observed by both Datchery and Deputy.

Dickens's death leaves the rest of the story unknown.  According to his friend and biographerJohn Forster, after writing him two brief letters which relate to the plot (but not the murder) Dickens had supplied Forster with an outline of the full plot:

Edwin Drood's fate is not clear. His killer, if any, is not revealed but is generally believed to be John Jasper, his uncle, for three reasons:

The book gives other hints:

Datchery appears some time after Edwin's disappearance and keeps a close eye on Jasper. There are hints that he is in disguise, and this possibility has been taken up in adaptations of the story which try to solve the mystery:

The Mystery of Edwin Droodwas scheduled to be published in twelve instalments (fewer than Dickens's usual twenty) from April 1870 to February 1871, each costing oneshillingand illustrated byLuke Fildes. Only six of the instalments were completed before Dickens's death in 1870. It was therefore approximately half-finished.

Planned instalments never published:

Supplying a conclusion toThe Mystery of Edwin Droodhas occupied writers from Dickens's death to the present day.

The first three attempts to complete the story were undertaken by Americans. The first, byRobert Henry Newell, published under the pen name Orpheus C. Kerr in 1870,[10]was as much a parody as a continuation, transplanting the story to the United States. It is a ""burlesque"" farce rather than a serious attempt to continue in the spirit of the original story.

The second ending was written by Henry Morford, a New York journalist. He travelled to Rochester with his wife and published the ending serially during his stay in England from 1871 to 1872. In this ending, Edwin Drood survives Jasper's murder attempt. Datchery is Bazzard in disguise, but Helena disguises herself as well to overhear Jasper's mumbling under the influence of opium. It was titledJohn Jasper's Secret: Sequel to Charles Dickens' Mystery of Edwin Drood. Newspaper articles from 1870 confirmed that the story would be completed and authored byCharles Dickens, JrandWilkie Collins, despite Collins's disavowal. The illustrative green cover for the book was designed by Charles Allston Collins,[11]who was Charles Dickens's son-in-law and Wilkie Collins's brother.[12][13]

The third attempt was perhaps the most unusual. In 1873, aBrattleboro, Vermont, printer,Thomas Power James, published a version which he claimed had been literally 'ghost-written' by him channelling Dickens's spirit.[14][15][16]A sensation was created:  several critics praised this version, includingArthur Conan Doyle, himself a spiritualist, who said it was similar in style to Dickens's work; and for several decades the James version ofEdwin Droodwas common in America. OtherDroodscholars disagree. John C. Walters dismissed it with contempt, stating that the work ""is self-condemned by its futility, illiteracy, and hideous American mannerisms; the mystery itself becomes a nightmare, and the solution only deepens the obscurity.""[17]

Four of the most recent of the posthumous collaborations areThe Mystery of Edwin DroodbyLeon Garfield(1980),The Decoding of Edwin Drood(1980) by Charles Forsyte,The Disappearance of Edwin Drood, a Holmesian pastiche by Peter Rowland (1992), andThe Mystery of Edwin Droodby David Madden (2011).[18]The D Case(1989) offered a humorous literary critique by the Italian duoFruttero & Lucentini.

On 7 January 1914 theDickens Fellowshiporganised a dramatic ""trial"" in the King's Hall,Covent Garden, in which John Jasper stood accused of the murder of Edwin Drood. Appearing as witnesses in ""court"" were five characters from the Dickens novel, as well as a jury and court officials, mostly played by writers, actors and other leading personalities of the day.

G. K. Chesterton, best known for theFather Brownmystery stories, was the Judge. The author ofThe Complete Edwin Drood,J. Cuming Walters, led the prosecution, while W. Walter Crotch andCecil Chestertonacted for the defence, and the latter's future wife,Ada Elizabeth Jones(appearing under her pseudonymMiss J. K. Prothero) was Princess Puffer.Bransby Williams, well known for his stage monologues as Dickens characters, was Anthony Durdles. Authors and scholarsArthur Waugh, C. Sheridan Jones and Mrs Laurence Clay, played Crisparkle, Bazzard and Helena Landless respectively, while the part of John Jasper was taken by amateur actor Frederick T. Harry.[19]

Foreman of the jury wasGeorge Bernard Shaw. Other jurors were selected from a list of nineteen named in the programme.  A copy of this, annotated by its original owner, suggests that the others on the jury bench wereWilliam Wymark Jacobs,William Pett Ridge,Tom Gallon,William de Morgan,Arthur Morrison, Raymond Paton,Francesco Berger,Ridgwell Callum,Justin Huntly McCarthy,Oscar BrowningandWilliam Archer.[19]

Proceedings were very light-hearted; Shaw in particular made wisecracks at the expense of others present. For instance, Shaw said that if the prosecution thought that producing evidence would influence the jury then ""he little knows his functions"".[20]

The jury returned a verdict ofmanslaughter, Shaw stating that it was a compromise on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to convict Jasper but that they did not want to run the risk of being murdered in their beds. Both sides protested and demanded that the jury be discharged. Shaw said the jury would be only too pleased to be discharged. Chesterton ruled that the mystery of Edwin Drood was insoluble and fined everyone, except himself, for contempt of court.[21]

To date, there have been four film adaptations ofThe Mystery of Edwin Drood.

The first two silent pictures released in 1909 (British)[22]and 1914 (American)[23]are unavailable to the general public and have been little seen since they were released. They were followed by:

The Mystery of Edwin Drood(1960) was a British television miniseries produced byITVand broadcast live in eight episodes, starringDonald Sindenas John Jasper,Richard Pearsonas Mr Crisparkle andTim Seelyas Edwin Drood.[24]This serial is believed to be lost, as no audio or video recordings are known to exist. Photographs taken from contemporary newspaper clippings exist with theBFI.

There wasa 2012 BBC television version, adapted with an original ending byGwyneth Hughesand directed byDiarmuid Lawrence, which aired on BBC Two on 10 and 11 January 2012 and on the PBS seriesMasterpieceon 15 April 2012.[25][26]

A five-part adaptation based on the Leon Garfield completion written by David Buck and directed by Gordon House was broadcast asBBC Radio 4'sClassic Serialfrom 3 to 30 March 1990.[30]The cast includedIan Holmas Jasper,John Moffattas Datchery,Gareth Thomasas Crisparkle,Michael Cochraneas Tartar,Timothy Batesonas Sapsea,Gordon Gostelowas Durdles andAnna Cropperas Mrs Tope;Mary Wimbushreprised her 1965 role of Princess Puffer and John Gabriel returned to play the role of Mr Grewgious.  It was last repeated onBBC Radio 4 Extrafrom 27 September to 1 October 2021.

A 10-part adaptation in 15-minute daily episodes, this time written byMike Walkerand directed byJeremy Mortimer, was broadcast onBBC Radio 4from 21 December 2020 to 1 January 2021.[31]The cast includedPippa NixonasKate Dickens(who acts as both narrator and commentator), Joel MacCormack as John Jasper, Isabella Inchbald as Rosa,Damian Lynchas Crisparkle, Rachel Atkins as Princess Puffer, Maanuv Thiara as Neville Landless, Halema Hussain as Helena Landless,Peter Davisonas Mr Grewgious and Iwan Davies as Edwin Drood. Some characters, including Lt Tartar and Mayor Sapsea, are omitted from this version and Bazzard, though mentioned by Mr Grewgious, does not appear. In this adaptation, Helena disguises herself as Dick Datchery, Edwin Drood survives the attack from Jasper, and Jasper kills himself by jumping from the cathedral tower after it is revealed that he was in love with Edwin, a major departure from his character and motivations in the original novel and other adaptations."
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/974,The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Agent,"Set inSoho, Londonin 1886, the novel follows the life of Adolf Verloc, asecret agent. Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives andbric-a-brac. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possiblyautism,[6]which causes him to be excitable; his sister, Verloc's wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc's friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and ""The Professor"" are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produces anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitledF.P., an acronym forThe Future of theProletariat.

The novel begins in Verloc's home, as he and his wife discuss the trivialities of everyday life, which introduces the reader to Verloc's family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country, for whom he works as anagent provocateur. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation – the destruction ofGreenwich Observatoryby a bomb. Vladimir explains that Britain's lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and he reasons that an attack on 'science', the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of acommunist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc's brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.

The novel flashes forward to after the bombing has taken place. Comrade Ossipon meets The Professor, who discusses having given explosives to Verloc. The Professor describes the nature of the bomb he carries in his coat at all times: it allows him to press a button which will kill him and those nearest to him in twenty seconds.  After The Professor leaves the meeting, he stumbles intoChief InspectorHeat, a policeman investigating a recent explosion at Greenwich, where one man was killed.  Heat informs The Professor that he is not a suspect in the case, but that he is being monitored due to his terrorist inclinations and anarchist background. Heat suspects Michaelis. Knowing that Michaelis has recently moved to thecountrysideto write a book, the Chief Inspector informs theAssistant Commissionerthat he has a contact, Verloc, who may be able to assist in the case. The Assistant Commissioner shares some of the same high society acquaintances with Michaelis and is chiefly motivated by finding the extent of Michaelis's involvement in order to assess any possible embarrassment to his connections. He later speaks to his superior, Sir Ethelred, about his intentions to solve the case alone, rather than rely on the effort of Chief Inspector Heat.

The novel flashes back to before the explosion, taking the perspective of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Winnie's mother informs the family that she intends to move out of the house. The move is motivated largely by a desire to avoid straining Mr. Verloc’s kindness. Winnie's mother and Stevie use ahansomdriven by a man with a hook for a hand. The driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs Verloc must calm him. On Verloc's return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to go for a walk with Stevie. After this walk, Winnie notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.

As Verloc is talking to his wife about the possibility of emigrating to the continent, he is paid a visit by the Assistant Commissioner. Shortly thereafter, Chief Inspector Heat arrives to speak with Verloc, without knowing that the Assistant Commissioner had left with Verloc earlier that evening.  The Chief Inspector tells Winnie that he had recovered an overcoat at the scene of the bombing which had the shop's address written on a label.  Winnie confirms that it was Stevie's overcoat, and that she had written the address. On Verloc's return, he realises that his wife knows that his bomb killed her brother, and confesses what truly happened. A stunned Winnie, in her anguish, fatally stabs her husband.

After the murder, Winnie flees her home, where she chances upon Comrade Ossipon, and begs him to help her. Ossipon assists her while confessing romantic feelings but secretly with a view to possess Mr Verloc's bank account savings.  They plan to run away and he aids her in taking a boat to the continent. However, her instability and the revelation of Verloc's murder increasingly worry him, and he abandons her, taking Mr Verloc's savings with him. He later discovers in a newspaper that a woman matching Winnie's description disappeared from the ferry, leaving behind her wedding ring before drowning herself in theEnglish Channel.

Conrad's character Stevie is based on the French anarchistMartial Bourdinwho died gruesomely when the explosives he carried detonated prematurely.[8]Bourdin's motives remain a mystery as does his intended target, which may have been theGreenwich Observatory.[9]In the 1920 Author's Note to the novel, Conrad recalls a discussion withFord Madox Fordabout the bombing:[10]

Terrorism and anarchism are intrinsic aspects of the novel, and are central to the plot. Verloc is employed by an agency which requires him to orchestrate terrorist activities, and several of the characters deal with terrorism in some way: Verloc's friends are all interested in an anarchisticpoliticalrevolution, and the police are investigating anarchist motives behind the bombing of Greenwich.

The novel was written at a time when terrorist activity was increasing. There had been numerous dynamite attacks in both Europe and the US, as well as several assassinations of heads of state.[12]Conrad also drew upon two persons specifically:Mikhail Bakuninand PrincePeter Kropotkin. Conrad used these two men in his ""portrayal of the novel's anarchists"".[13]However, according to Conrad's Author's Note, only one character was a true anarchist: Winnie Verloc. InThe Secret Agent, she is ""the only character who performs a serious act of violence against another"",[14]despite theF.P.'s intentions of radical change, and The Professor's inclination to keep a bomb on his person.

Critics have analysed the role of terrorism in the novel.Patrick Reillycalls the novel ""a terrorist text as well as a text about terrorism""[15]due to Conrad's manipulation ofchronologyto allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. Themoralitywhich is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.[16]

The role of politics is paramount in the novel, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The role of politics is seen in several places in the novel: in the revolutionary ideas of theF.P.; in the characters' personalbeliefs; and in Verloc's own private life. Conrad's depiction ofanarchismhas an ""enduring political relevance"", although the focus is now largely concerned with the terrorist aspects that this entails.[17]The discussions of theF.P.are expositions on the role of anarchism and its relation to contemporary life. The threat of these thoughts is evident, as Chief Inspector Heat knowsF.P.members because of their anarchist views. Moreover, Michaelis' actions are monitored by the police to such an extent that he must notify the police station that he is moving to the country.

The plot to destroy Greenwich is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing ""must be purely destructive"" and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion ""should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.""[18]However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency.

Some critics, such as Fredrick R Karl,[19]think that the main politicalphenomenonin this novel is the modern age, assymbolisedby the teeming, pullulating foggy streets of London (most notably in the cab ride taken by Winnie Verloc and Stevie).  This modern age distorts everything, including politics (Verloc is motivated by the need to keep his remunerative position, the Professor to some extent by pride); the family (symbolised by the Verloc household, in which all roles are distorted, with the husband being like a father to the wife, who is like a mother to her brother); even the human body (Michaelis and Verloc are hugely obese, while the Professor and Yundt are unusually thin). This extendedmetaphor, using London as a centre of darkness much like Kurtz's headquarters inHeart of Darkness,[20]presents ""a dark vision ofmoraland spiritual inertia"" and a condemnation of those who, like Mrs Verloc, think it a mistake to think too deeply.[21]

Initially, the novel fared poorly in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling only 3,076 copies between 1907 and 1914. The book fared slightly better in Britain, yet no more than 6,500 copies were printed before 1914. Although sales increased after 1914, it never sold more than modestly during Conrad's life. It was published to favourable reviews, most agreeing with the view ofThe Times Literary Supplementthat it ""increase[d] Conrad's reputation, already of the highest"".[22]However, there were detractors who criticised the novel's ""unpleasant characters and subject"".Country Lifemagazine called the story ""indecent"" and criticised Conrad's ""often dense andellipticalstyle"".[22]

The Secret Agenthas come to be considered one of Conrad's finest novels.The Independentcalls it ""[o]ne of Conrad's great city novels""[23]whilstThe New York Timesinsists that it is ""the most brilliant novelistic study of terrorism"".[24]The Pequodcalled the book “one of Joseph Conrad's best books,” and rated the book a 9.5 out of 10.0.”[25]In a 2016 review,The National Reviewsaid the book “may be the first great novel of global terrorism.”[26]

The Secret AgentinfluencedTed Kaczynski, also known as theUnabomber. He was a great fan and as an adolescent kept a copy at his bedside.[27]He identified strongly with the character of ""The Professor"" and advised his family to readThe Secret Agentto understand the character with whom he felt such an affinity. Don Foster, the literary attributionist who assisted theFBI, said that Kaczynski ""seem[ed] to have felt that his family could not understand him without reading Conrad"".[28]

Kaczynski's idolisation of the character was due to the personality traits that they shared: disaffection, hostility toward the world, and being an aspiring anarchist.[29]However, it did not stop at mere idolisation. Kaczynski used ""The Professor"" as a source of inspiration, and ""fabricated sixteen exploding packages that detonated in various locations"".[30]After his capture, Kaczynski revealed to FBI agents that he had read the novel a dozen times, and had sometimes used ""Conrad"" as an alias.[31]It was discovered that Kaczynski had used various formulations of Conrad's name – Conrad, Konrad, and Korzeniowski, Conrad's original surname – to sign himself into several hotels in Sacramento.  As in his youth, Kaczynski retained a copy ofThe Secret Agent, and kept it with him while living as areclusein a hut inMontana.[12]

Various scenes from the novel were also dramatised inJoseph Conrad's The Secret Agent(1987), a 60-minute UK documentary featuringFrances Barber,Hywel Bennett,Jim BroadbentandBrian Glover.[4]

Audibleaudiobookshave produced at least 13 different unabridged readings of the novel, including in French, German and Spanish.[51]

Conrad's novel has been adapted as operas by Simon Wills (2006),Michael Dellaira(2011), and Allen Reichman and Curtis Bryant (2013).[4]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70114,The Big Four,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Four_(novel),"An unexpected visitor called Mayerling comes in through Hercule Poirot's bedroom and collapses on the floor. The only clue to what he wants is his repeating Poirot's name and address and writing the number 4, many times. When Hastings jokingly calls it ""The Mystery of the Big Four,"" the man begins speaking about an international crime cartel of that name. He describes the four leaders: Number 1 is a Chinese political mastermind named Li Chang Yen; Number 2 is probably American; Number 3 is a Frenchwoman; and Number 4 is known only as ""the Destroyer."" The man dies soon after Poirot and Hastings go off on the trail of the Big Four.

From here, the novel becomes a series of loosely connected short stories.

A multiethnic gang of four persons working towards world domination.[8]They have a secret hideaway in aquarryof theDolomites. It is owned by an Italian company which is afront companyfor Abe Ryland. The quarry conceals a vast subterranean base, hollowed out in the heart of the mountain. From there they usewirelesscommunications to transfer orders to thousands of their followers across many countries.[9]The characters comprise typicalethnicand nationalstereotypesof 1920s British fiction. They are:

These characters are described by Zemboy.[7]: 43–47Most are also described by Bunson.[5]: 24–25

Jerry Speir points out that the novel departs from the formula of theHercule Poirotseries. The novel is not set in themanor houseor arural arealike a number of its predecessors, nor do the characters represent the Britishgentry. The villains are a gang of international criminals, controlling a secret, global organization. Their goals include the so-called disintegration of humancivilization. They control an unspecified ""scientific force"", a weapon of some kind. Speir speculates that they could hold the secrets togravityornuclear power.[10]

Armin Risi agrees that this was to be the great case of Poirot's life, as the character himself claims that all other cases will seem tame by comparison (similar toSherlock Holmes' statement about his own confrontation withProfessor Moriarty). Poirot does not track down a murderer; he must face and expose asupranationalassociation of high-ranking personalities who are working towardsworld domination.[8]Risi sees the book as a work of secret history which was inspired by the events and causes ofWorld War Iand theOctober Revolution(the novel was presumably written in 1924 or 1925; see the biographical remark below). The basic scenario of the novel has secret powers (the Four) influencing humanity and the course of history. To Risi it seems to beAgatha Christie's warning about real-life organizations doing the same. He points out that Christie herself may not have been an objective historian. She was a member of thehigh societyin theBritish Empire. But this fact possibly gave her access to first-hand observers of world politics and the secret affairs behind them.[8]During theinterwar period, World War I and the October Revolution were still significant topics of conversation. He theorizes that Christie may have learned of organizations of conspirators active in the era, at least those active in theCity of London. There were already rumors that secret forces were planningWorld War IIor evenWorld War III.[8]

James Zemboy observes that this novel lacks the unity of plot of a proper novel. It is a series of episodes, only unified by the theme of Hercule Poirot investigating and uncovering the identity of one of thevillains. The Big Four themselves are unique characters, each one representing a personification ofevil. But Zemboy finds these characters lacking in traits to make them amusing, engaging, or personally interesting. The minor characters are not unique. They are generic messengers or information providers. John Ingles serves only to provide information on Li Chang Yen, Flossie Monro is only significant in providing a single clue, and Sonia Daviloff only serves to show Poirot the position of the chess table.[7]

Zemboy finds the book atypically boring for Christie. He believes that readers whose only exposure to her work is this novel, will be unlikely to pursue more of her books. The episodic nature of the book could have led to it being twice as long or half as long, without making any difference. The pattern of the novel is a series of dangerous encounters and failures to catch the criminals. Poirot repeatedly sets traps for the enemy. Repeatedly the enemy knows in advance and does not fall for them. On the other side, the Big Four set traps for Poirot. He evades most of them, only to find that the Four anticipated his moves as well. He does fall for some ""real"" traps.[7]

Jeremy Black, a historian, points out that a number of Agatha Christie's novels of theinterwar periodrecord the standard fears of affluent society in the era. She added the ""paranoid"" conviction of an underlyingconspiracy. This is an element present in her literary work and absent in theadaptations of Agatha Christiefor television and film.[11]

Black adds that Christie's work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges. The Big Four, the characters, are positioned as the hidden cause and connecting threat between the world-wide unrest, labour disputes, and the revolutions of the period—in particular, theOctober Revolution, withVladimir LeninandLeon Trotskydescribed as their puppets. The Big Four also have advanced technology in their arsenal.[11]

Li Chang Yen is both a creature of sinisterOrientalismand an echo of an earlier literary character:Fu ManchubySax Rohmer. The character was described as ""the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put on theEarthfor centuries"", the foe of theBritish EmpireandBritish civilizationin general. The character combined great cruelty with advanced scientific research. InThe Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu(1913), the eponymous character is presented as a figure behindAnti-Westernactions inBritish Hong KongandChinese Turkestan. He is striking against Western politicians and administrators who are aware of the secretgeopoliticalimportance ofTonkin,Mongolia, andTibet, using these areas as a keyhole to the gate of theIndian Empire.[11]

Fu Manchu's agents wereomnipresenteven in England. His organization was likened to a yellow octopus with Fu Manchu as its head withdacoitsandthugsas its tentacles. These agents killed secretly, swiftly, and leaving no clue behind.[11]These were the literary predecessors of the Four and their agents.

David Suchet, who played Poirot forITVfrom 1989 to 2013, had a different suggestion as to the origins of the Big Four. He found them to be an evil counterpart ofThe Four Just Menseries byEdgar Wallace. He agrees, however, that Li Chang Yen was inspired by Fu Manchu.[12]

This novel was published a year afterThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd(1926) and was overshadowed by its predecessor.[5]

TheTimes Literary Supplementreview of the book publication struck a positive although incorrect note in its issue of 3 February 1927 when it assumed that the different style of the book from its immediate predecessor,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, was a deliberate ploy: ""M. Poirot, the Belgian detective who has figured in others of Mrs Christie's tales, is in very good form in the latest series of adventures. The device which made 'Who killed Roger Ackroyd?' (sic) such a puzzling problem for the reader of detective fiction is one that a writer cannot easily employ a second time, and indeed the present story is not so much the clearing up of a mystery as a recital of Poirot's encounters with one of those familiar groups of international crooks of almost unlimited power who seek to dominate the world."" Hastings was described as ""dense as ever"".[13]

The New York Times Book Reviewof 2 October 1927 outlined the basics of the plot and stated""'Number Four' remains a mystery almost to the end. This, of course, makes it more difficult for the detective to guard against attack and to carry on his investigation, and it provides most of the thrills of the story.""[14]

The reviewer inThe Observerof 13 February 1927 did not expect originality when reading a book dealing with the themes ofThe Big Four, but did admit that ""When one opens a book and finds the name Li Chang Yen and is taken to subterranean chambers in the East End 'hung with rich Oriental silks', one fears the worst. Not that Mrs Christie gives us the worst; she is far too adroit and accomplished a hand for that. But the short, interpolated mysteries within the mystery are really much more interesting than the machinations of the 'Big Four' supermen."" The conclusion of the book was ""pretentious"" and ""fails to be impressive"" and the reviewer summed up by saying, ""the book has its thrills – in fact, too many of them; it seeks to make up in its details what it lacks in quality and consistency.""[15]

The Scotsmanof 17 March 1927 said, ""The activities of Poirot himself cannot be taken seriously, as one takes, for example, Sherlock Holmes. The book, indeed, reads more like an exaggerated parody of popular detective fiction than a serious essay in the type. But it certainly provides plenty of fun for the reader who is prepared to be amused. If that was the intention of the authoress, she has succeeded to perfection"".[16]

Robert Barnard: ""This thriller was cobbled together at the lowest point in Christie's life, with the help of her brother-in-law. Charity is therefore the order of the day, and is needed, for this is pretty dreadful, and (whatever one may think of him as a creation) demeaning to Poirot.""[17]

The Big Fourwas released byHarperCollinsas agraphic noveladaptation on 3 December 2007, adapted and illustrated by Alain Paillou (ISBN0-00-725065-7). This was translated from the edition first published in France byEmmanuel Proust éditionsin 2006 under the title ofLes Quatre.

The novel was adapted for television withDavid Suchetas Poirot, as part of the final series ofAgatha Christie's Poirot. The film premiered on ITV on 23 October 2013 and onPBSon 27 July 2014 in the United States;[18]it also guest-starredSarah Parish,Patricia Hodge,Tom Brooke,Nicholas Burns, andSimon Lowe. Suchet's former co-starsHugh Fraser,Philip Jackson, andPauline Moranreprised their roles as Hastings, Japp, and Miss Lemon. The episode is very loosely based on the novel, considered by writerMark Gatissto be ""an almost unadaptable mess"".[19]"

Anne Beddingfeld witnesses an accident atHyde Park Corner tube stationwhen a man falls onto the live track. Anne picks up a note dropped by the doctor who examined the dead man, which read ""17.1122 Kilmorden Castle"" and a house agent's order to view Mill House in Marlow where a dead woman has been found the next day. A young man in a brown suit was identified as a suspect, having entered the house soon after the dead woman.

Anne realises the examination of the dead man was oddly done and visits the Mill House where she finds a canister of undeveloped film, and she learns that 'Kilmorden Castle' is a sailing ship and books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler and his secretaries, Guy Pagett and Harry Rayburn.

Colonel Race recounts the story of the theft of diamonds some years before, attributed to the son of a South African gold magnate, John Eardsley, and his friend Harry Lucas. The friends joined the war where John was killed and his father's huge fortune passed to his next of kin, Race himself. Lucas was posted as ""missing in action"".

Anne and Suzanne examine the piece of paper Anne obtained in the Underground station and realises that it could refer to cabin 71, Suzanne's cabin, originally booked by a woman who did not appear. Anne connects finding the film roll in Mill House with a film canister containing uncut diamonds that was dropped into Suzanne's cabin in the early hours of the 22nd. They speculate that Harry Rayburn is the Man in the Brown Suit.

InCape Town, Anne is lured to a house atMuizenberg, where she is imprisoned but manages to escape the next morning and returns to Cape Town to find that Harry is wanted as the Man in the Brown Suit and has gone missing. Pedler offers Anne the role of his secretary on his train trip toRhodesiawhich she accepts at the last second, and is reunited on the train with Race, Suzanne and Pedler, who has a new secretary named Miss Pettigrew.

InBulawayo, Anne receives a note from Harry which lures her out to a ravine near their hotel. She is chased and falls into the ravine. Almost a month later, Anne awakens in a hut on an island in theZambeziwith Harry Rayburn, who rescued her. Anne and Harry fall in love and Harry tells her his side of the story revealing that he and John were both in love with Anita / Nadina who cheated them. Carton, her husband fell to the track on the shock of seeing Harry again. Harry admits that he is the man in brown suit but denied that he killed Anita. Harry's island is attacked, but the two escape, and Anne returns to Pedler's party. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so that neither can be duped again. She receives a telegram signed Harry telling her to meet him, but not using their code.

Race tells her that Harry is John Eardsley, not Harry Lucas. Harry admits that receiving a huge fortune worries him and that he has found his happiness with Anne, and they marry and live on the island in the Zambezi and have a son.

The Times Literary Supplementreviewed the novel in its issue of 25 September 1924. The review appreciated the ""thriller-cum-adventure"" style of the book and concluded, ""The author sets so many questions to the reader in her story, questions which will almost certainly be answered wrongly, that no one is likely to nod over it, and even the most experienced reader of romances will fail to steer an unerring course and reach the harbour of solution through the quicksands and shoals of blood, diamonds, secret service, impersonation, kidnapping, and violence with which the mystery is guarded.""[4]

The unnamed reviewer inThe Observer(7 September 1924) wrote: ""Miss Christie has done one bold and one regrettable thing in this book. She has dispensed withHercule Poirot, her own particularSherlock Holmes, to whose presence and bonhomie and infallibility the success of her previous books has been mainly due."" After comparing Poirot with Harry Rayburn, the reviewer continued by saying that the book, ""will be something of a disappointment to those who rememberThe Mysterious Affair at Styles. It is an excellent and ingenious complexity, in its way, but it might have been written by quite a number of the busy climbers who now throng this particular slope ofParnassus. One almost suspects that Miss Christie contemplates exchanging the mantle ofConan Doylefor that of MissDell; a hazardous manoeuvre, for the two authoresses are very different in tastes and sympathies."" The reviewer went on to say that, ""The plan of the book is rather confused. There is a prologue which does not link itself up with the rest of the story for quite a long time; and the idea of giving alternate passages from the diaries of the heroine and of Sir Eustace Pedler is not altogether justified by the glimpses it gives of that entertaining but disreputable character. One of the points on which some readers will have doubts is as to the plausibility of the villain: assuredly he is a novel type in that role. The book, like all Miss Christie's work, is written with spirit and humour.""[3]

Robert Barnardsaid about this novel that it was ""Written during and about a trip to Southern Africa, this opens attractively with the heroine and her archeologist father (Agatha's interest in the subject was obviously pre-Max), and has some pleasant interludes with the diary of the baddie. But it degenerates into the usual stuff of her thrillers, and the plot would probably not bear close examination, if anyone were to take the trouble.""[5]

Some additionalblurbsregarding the book, and used by The Bodley Head for advertising subsequent print runs, are as follows:

The book has some parallels to incidents and settings of a round-the-world work trip taken by Christie with her first husbandArchie Christieand headed by his old teacher fromClifton College, Major E A Belcher, to promote the forthcoming 1924British Empire Exhibition. The tour lasted from 20 January to 1 December 1922. It was on the tour that Christie wrote the short stories which would form all ofPoirot Investigates(1924) and most of the contents ofPoirot's Early Cases, published in 1974.[7]

Dining with the Christies before the trip, Belcher had suggested setting a mystery novel in his home, the Mill House atDorneyand naming the bookThe Mystery of the Mill House; and had insisted on being in it as well. He is the inspiration for the central character Sir Eustace Pedler, having been given a title at Archie's suggestion.[8]The Mill House also makes an appearance, albeit located inMarlow.

Christie found Belcher ""childish, mean and somehow addictive as a personality: 'Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace', wrote Agatha of the fictionalised Belcher, a main character inThe Man in the Brown Suit. 'I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it is.'""[9]InAgatha Christie: The Grand Tour, Christie writes that for all his shortcomings, she and Archie ""did not keep to our vow of never speaking to Belcher again...To our enormous surprise, we found that we actually liked Belcher, that we enjoyed his company.""[10]

The Man in the Brown Suitaired in the US on 4 January 1989, adapted by Alan Shayne Productions, in association withWarner Brothers Television. It is set in a later era than the 1920s, and many details are changed as a result: the setting, for instance, is Cairo. At least one review found the story lacking, feeling that those adaptations of Christie's novels shown onPBSin the United States fared better than this one, which aired onCBS.[11]

Adaptor:Carla Jean WagnerDirector:Alan Grint

Main Cast:

The novel was adapted as a 2017 episode of the French television seriesLes Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie.

The Man in the Brown Suitwas released byHarperCollinsas agraphic noveladaptation on 16 July 2007, and, on 3 December 2007 was adapted by Hughot and illustrated by Bairi (ISBN0-00-725062-2). This was translated from the edition first published in France byEmmanuel Proust éditionsin 2005 under the title ofL'Homme au complet marron.

The first UK edition retailed at sevenshillingsandsixpence(7/6)[12]and the US edition at $2.00.[2]

Following completion in late 1923,[7]The Man in the Brown Suitwas first serialised in theLondon Evening Newsunder the titleAnne the Adventurous. It ran in fifty instalments from Thursday, 29 November 1923 to Monday, 28 January 1924. There were slight amendments to the text, either to make sense of the openings of an instalment (e.g. changing ""She then..."" to ""Anne then...""), or omitting small sentences or words. The main change was in the chapter divisions. The published book has 36 chapters whereas the serialisation has only 28 chapters.[13]

In her 1977AutobiographyChristie refers to it asAnna the Adventuress. The change from her preferred title was not of her choosing and the newspaper's choice was one that she considered to be ""as silly a title as I have ever heard"". She raised no objections, however, as theEvening Newswere paying her£500 (£36,021 in current terms)[14]for the serial rights which she and her family considered an enormous sum.[8]At the suggestion of her first husband Archie, Christie used the money to purchase a grey, bottle-nosedMorris Cowley. She later stated that acquiring her own car ranked with dining atBuckingham Palaceas one of the two most exciting incidents in her life.[8]

Christie was less pleased with thedustjacketof the book, complaining to the Bodley Head that the illustration, by an unnamed artist, looked as if the incident at theTube Stationoccurred in ""mediaeval times"", when she wanted something ""more clear, definite and modern"".[7]The Bodley Head were anxious to sign a new contract with Christie, now recognising her potential, but she wanted to move on, feeling that ""they had not treated a young author fairly.""[8]The US serialisation was in theBlue Bookmagazine in three instalments from September (Volume 39, Issue 5) to November 1924 (Volume 40, Issue 1) with each issue containing an uncredited illustration.

Christie's dedication in the book reads:""To E.A.B. In memory of a journey, some Lion stories and a request that I should some day write theMystery of the Mill House"".

""E A B"" refers to Major E A Belcher (seeDevelopment of the novelabove).

The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially writtenblurb. Instead both the front and back flap carried adverts for other Bodley Head novels."
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72824,The mystery of the Blue Train,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Blue_Train,"Poirot boardsLe Train Bleu, bound for theFrench Riviera. So does Katherine Grey, who is having her first winter out of England, after recently receiving a relatively large inheritance. On board the train Grey meets Ruth Kettering, an Americanheiressleaving her unhappy marriage to meet her lover. The next morning, though, Ruth is found dead in her compartment, a victim ofstrangulation.

The famous ruby, ""Heart of Fire"", which had recently been given to Ruth by her father, is discovered to be missing. Ruth's father, American millionaire Rufus Van Aldin, and his secretary, Major Knighton, persuade Poirot to take on the case. Ruth's maid, Ada Mason, says that she saw a man in Ruth's compartment but could not see who he was. The police suspect that Ruth's lover, the Comte de la Roche, killed her and stole the ruby, but Poirot does not think that the Comte is guilty. He is suspicious of Ruth's estranged husband, Derek Kettering, who was on the same train but claims not to have seen Ruth. Katherine says that she saw Derek enter Ruth's compartment. Further suspicion is thrown on Derek when a cigarette case with the letter ""K"" is found there.

Poirot investigates and finds out that the murder and the jewel theft might not be connected, as the famous jewel thief ""The Marquis"" is connected to the crime. Eventually, the avaricious Mirelle, who was on the train with Derek—with whom she had been having an affair but, now spurned, is seeking revenge against him—tells Poirot she saw Derek leave Ruth's compartment around the time the murder would have taken place. Derek is then arrested. Everyone is convinced the case is solved, but Poirot is not sure. He does more investigating and learns more information, talking to his friends and to Katherine, eventually coming to the truth.

He asks Van Aldin and Knighton to come with him on the Blue Train to recreate the murder. He tells them that Ada Mason is really Kitty Kidd, a renowned male impersonator and actress. Katherine saw what she thought was a boy getting off the train, but it was really Mason. Poirot realised that Mason was the only person claiming to have seen anyone with Ruth in the compartment, so this could have been a lie. He reveals that the murderer and Mason's accomplice is Knighton, who is really the ruthless ""Marquis"". He also says that the cigarette case with the K on it does not stand for 'Kettering', but for 'Knighton'. Since Knighton was supposedly in Paris, no one would have suspected him. Derek did go into the compartment to talk to Ruth once he saw she was on the train, but he left when he saw she was asleep. The police arrest Knighton and the case is closed."

The guest list includes Gerry Wade, Jimmy Thesiger, Ronny Devereux, Bill Eversleigh, and Rupert ""Pongo"" Bateman. Since Wade has a bad habit of oversleeping, the others play a joke on him by placing eight alarm clocks in his room and timing them to go off at intervals. The next morning, a footman finds Wade dead in his bed, withchloralon his nightstand. Thesiger notices that one of the eight alarm clocks is missing. It is later found in a hedge.

Lord Caterham and his daughter Lady Eileen “Bundle” Brent move back into Chimneys. When Bundle drives to London to see Eversleigh, Ronny Devereux jumps out in front of her car. Before he dies, Devereux mutters ""Seven Dials..."" and ""Tell...Jimmy Thesiger."" Bundle gets his body to a doctor, who tells her that her car did not hit Devereux; he was shot.

Seven Dials turns out to be a seedynightclubandgambling denin theSeven Dialsarea of London. Bundle recognizes thedoormanas Alfred, afootmanfrom Chimneys. Alfred tells her that he left Chimneys for far higher wages offered by Mosgorovsky, owner of the club. Alfred takes Bundle into a secret room, where she hides in a cupboard and witnesses a meeting of six people wearing hoods with clock faces. They talk of the always-missing ""Number Seven"", and about an upcoming party at Wyvern Abbey, where a scientist called Eberhard will offer a secret formula for sale to the British Air Minister.

At the party, the formula is stolen, but retrieved by Wade's sister, and Jimmy Thesiger is shot in his right arm. Thesiger tells how he fought a man who climbed down the ivy. The next morning, Battle finds a charred left-handed glove with teeth marks in the fireplace. He theorizes that the thief threw the gun onto the lawn from the terrace and then climbed back into the house via the ivy. Bundle’s father reports that Bauer, the footman who replaced Alfred, is missing.

Thesiger rings up Bundle and Gerry Wade's sister Loraine and tells them to meet him and Eversleigh at the Seven Dials club. Bundle shows Thesiger the room where the Seven Dials meet. Loraine finds Eversleigh unconscious in the car and they take him into the club. Thesiger says that he will go for a doctor.

Someone knocks Bundle unconscious and she comes round in Eversleigh's arms. Mr Mosgorovsky takes them into the meeting of the Seven Dials, where Number Seven is revealed as Superintendent Battle. He reveals that they are a group of people doing secret service work for the government. Battle tells Bundle that the association has succeeded with their main target, an international criminal whose stock in trade is the theft of secret formulae: Jimmy Thesiger was arrested that afternoon with his accomplice, Loraine Wade. Battle explains that Thesiger killed Wade and Devereux when they got onto his track. Devereux took the eighth clock from Wade's room to see if anyone reacted to there being ""seven dials"". At Wyvern Abbey, Thesiger stole the formula, passed it to Loraine, then shot himself in his right arm and disposed of his left-hand glove using his teeth. Eversleigh feigned unconsciousness in the car outside the Seven Dials club. Thesiger never went for a doctor, but hid in the club, and knocked Bundle unconscious. Bundle takes Wade's place in the Seven Dials and marries Bill Eversleigh.

The review in theTimes Literary Supplementissue of 4 April 1929 was for once markedly unenthusiastic about a Christie Book: ""It is a great pity that Mrs Christie should in this, as in a previous book, have deserted the methodical procedure of inquiry into a single and circumscribed crime for the romance of universal conspiracy and international rogues. These Gothic romances are not to be despised but they are so different in kind from the story of strict detection that it is unlikely for anyone to be adept in both. Mrs Christie lacks the haphazard and credulous romanticism which makes the larger canvas of more extensive crime successful. In such a performance bravura rather than precision is essential. The mystery of Seven Dials and of the secret society which met in that sinister district requires precisely such a broad treatment, but Mrs Christie gives to it that minute study which she employed so skilfully in her earlier books."" The review concluded, ""There is no particular reason why the masked man should be the particular person he turns out to be"".[5]

The review inThe New York Times Book Reviewof 7 April 1929 began ""After reading the opening chapters of this book one anticipates an unusually entertaining yarn. There are some very jolly young people in it, and the fact that they become involved in a murder mystery does not dampen their spirits to any great extent."" The uncredited reviewer set up the plot regarding Gerald Wade being found dead and then said, ""Thus far the story is excellent; indeed it continues to promise well until the time comes when the mystery is to be solved. Then it is seen that the author has been so keen on preventing the reader from guessing the solution that she has rather overstepped the bounds of what should be permitted to a writer of detective stories. She has held out information which the reader should have had, and, not content with scattering false clues with a lavish hand, she has carefully avoided leaving any clues pointing to the real criminal. Worst of all, the solution itself is utterly preposterous. This book is far below the standard set by Agatha Christie's earlier stories.""[6]

The Scotsmanof 28 January 1929 said, ""Less good in point of style than some of her earlier novels, The Seven Dials Mystery…maintains the author's reputation of ingenuity."" The review went on to say that, ""It is an unusual feature of this story that at the end, the reader will want to go back over the story to see if he has had a square deal from the author. On the whole he has.""[4]

Robert Barnardnoted that this novel had the ""Same characters and setting withChimneys"" and then concluded his view of it by adding ""but without the same verve and cheek.""[7]

The first UK edition retailed at sevenshillingsandsixpence(7/6)[8]and the US edition at $2.00.[3]

In her autobiography, Christie states that this book was what she called “the light-hearted thriller type”. She went on to say that they were always easy to write as they didn’t require too much plotting or planning, presumably in contrast to the very-tightly planned detective stories. She called this era her “plutocratic” period in that she was starting to receive sums for American serialisation rights which both exceeded what she earned in the UK for such rights and was, at this time, free of income tax.[9]She compared this period favourably with the time at which she wrote these comments (1950s to 1960s) when she was plagued with income tax problems which lasted for some twenty years and ate up most of what people presumed was a large fortune.[10]

The book entered the public domain in the US on January 1st 2025.[11]

Theblurbof the first edition (which is carried on both the back of thedustjacketand opposite the title page) reads:

Following the success of their version ofWhy Didn't They Ask Evansin 1980,The Seven Dials Mysterywas adapted byLondon Weekend Televisionas a 140-minute television film and transmitted on Sunday 8 March 1981. The same team of Pat Sandys, Tony Wharmby and Jack Williams worked on the production which again starredJohn GielgudandJames Warwick.Cheryl Campbellalso starred as ""Bundle"" Brent. The production was extremely faithful to the book with no major deviations to the plot or characters.

This second success of adapting an Agatha Christie book led to the same company commissioningThe Secret AdversaryandAgatha Christie's Partners in Crimefor their 1983 transmission.

The production was first screened on US television as part ofMobilShowcasein April 1981.

In 2024,Netflixannounced plans foran adaptationof the novel, to be written byChris Chibnalland directed by Chris Sweeney, with Suzanne Mackie as executive producer,[13]and starringMia McKenna-Bruceas Bundle,Helena Bonham-Carteras Lady Caterham andMartin Freemanas Battle.[14]"

In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories toThe Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"" (as his favourite), ""The Red-Headed League"" (second), ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (fifth) and ""The Five Orange Pips"" (seventh).[8]The book was banned in theSoviet Unionin 1929 because of its alleged ""occultism"",[9]but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.[10]

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being ""worthy of the inventive genius"" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it ""might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago"", but that ""the unique power"" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, ""with all his little foibles"",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as ""rather a bore sometimes"", noting that descriptions of his foibles ""grows wearisome"".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author ""who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want"".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: ""It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.""[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes ""the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.""[34]

Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921–1923Stoll film series(all except ""The Five Orange Pips""),[35]the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(1930–1936),[36]the 1939–1950 radio seriesThe New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(all except ""The Beryl Coronet""),[37]and the BBC Sherlock Holmes1952–1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in theGranada TelevisionseriesSherlock Holmeswhich ran from 1984 until 1994.[38]The stories inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere dramatised forBBC Radio 4in 1990–1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series,[39]and were adapted as episodes of the radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(2005–2016).[40]The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41325,幽霊書店 (Japanese),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunted_Bookshop,"The narrative begins with a young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert, stopping by a bookstore named ""The Haunted Bookshop"" in the hopes of finding a new client. Gilbert meets the proprietor, Roger Mifflin. Gilbert does not succeed in selling advertising copy, but is intrigued by Mifflin and his conviction concerning the value books and booksellers have to the world. Additionally, Gilbert is intrigued by the fact that his firm's biggest client, Mr. Chapman, is a friend of Mifflin and has asked Mifflin to undertake the education of his daughter, Titania Chapman, by hiring her as an assistant.

Gilbert returns to the book store, meets Titania, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, mysterious things start to happen: a copy ofThomas Carlyle'sLetters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwelldisappears and reappears, Gilbert is attacked as he travels home, a pharmacist neighbor of Mifflin is observed skulking in the alley behind the bookstore at night speaking to someone in German, and an assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel has posted an ad inThe New York Timespromising a reward for a lost copy ofLetters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. Gilbert starts to sense that something nefarious is afoot. He suspects that the gregarious Mifflin is involved in a plot to kidnap Titania, and he assigns himself the job of protecting her.

Meanwhile, Mifflin begins to train Titania in the booksellers' trade. His focus is so centered on books and their content that he fails to note the unusual things that are occurring.

Gilbert takes a room across from the bookstore in order to keep eye on things, and believes his suspicions confirmed when he sees the pharmacist let himself into the bookshop with his own key late at night. Gilbert breaks into the bookshop in an effort to find evidence to prove his suspicions, but only manages to frighten and anger Titania.

Gilbert learns that Mifflin is to take a day trip to Philadelphia, and follows him in the belief that the trip is a part of the ""kidnapping"" plot. In Philadelphia Gilbert confronts Mifflin with his suspicions, telling him of all the things that have occurred. The two realize that a third party had lured Mifflin away from the shop. They call the bookshop and learn that the pharmacist has left a suitcase of books there for someone else to pick up. Mifflin tells Titania to hold on to the case until he returns.

Mifflin and Gilbert return to the bookshop and find it locked. Inside, the pharmacist and an associate of his have tied up Mrs. Mifflin and are menacing Titania with a gun.

A fight ensues, part of the bookstore is destroyed by a bomb, and the pharmacist escapes. The only casualties of the bomb are the pharmacist's partner and Mifflin's dog, Bock. Mifflin even affects to be pleased as the blast knocked down books he'd forgotten he had.

In the final chapter of the book Gilbert and Mifflin learn what the true plot was: The pharmacist was a German spy who had been using the bookshop as a drop-off point. He was a specialist in making bombs, and had hidden a bomb in one of PresidentWoodrow Wilson's favorite books. The pharmacist's co-conspirator was the assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel. He was to be part of the crew on the ship Wilson was to travel on to peace talks in Europe, and was to plant the bomb in Wilson's cabin in an assassination plot. The pharmacist was captured by police, and killed himself.

This is primarily a novel of suspense, though throughout it Morley proclaims the value of books. Mifflin, the protagonist, is a self-described ""practitioner of bibliotherapy"" who thinks booksellers heal minds just like doctors heal bodies. Mifflin describes a ""librocubicularist"" as someone who is fond of readings in bed.[1]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685,The Mystery of the Yellow Room,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Yellow_Room,"Reporter and amateur sleuthJoseph Rouletabilleis sent to investigate acriminal caseat the Château du Glandier and takes along his friend the lawyer Sainclair, who narrates.  Mathilde Stangerson, the 30-something daughter of the castle's owner, Professor Joseph Stangerson, was found near-critically battered in a room adjacent to his laboratory on the castle grounds, with the door still locked from the inside.  She recovers slowly but can give no useful testimony.  Rouletabille meets and interrogates several characters: the castle's concierges Mr & Mrs Bernier, the old servant Jacques, an unfriendly inn landlord and a womanising gamekeeper, and begins a friendly rivalry with France's top police detective Frédéric Larsan, who has been assigned the case.  Larsan suspects Ms Stangerson's fiancé, another scientist called Robert Darzac, to Rouletabille's dismay.

More attempts are made on Ms Stangerson's life despite Rouletabille and Larsan's protection, and the perpetrator appears to vanish on two occasions when they are closing in on him, echoing Professor Stangerson's research into ""matter dissociation"".  The gamekeeper is murdered during the second attempt.  Ultimately, Larsan arrests Darzac who is charged with murder attempts.  Rouletabille suspects that Darzac has secret reasons not to defend himself and he disappears to make further investigations.

Two-and-a-half months later, as Darzac's trial opens, Rouletabille reappears sensationally and tells the court that the culprit is Frédéric Larsan himself, whom he accuses of being an alter-ego of a master criminal called Ballmeyer.  Larsan appeared to vanish on the two occasions he was nearly collared as he was one of the pursuers.  Darzac is released when it emerges that Larsan has vanished after Rouletabille warned him he would accuse him in court.  The mystery of the locked Yellow Room is explained thus: Larsan assaulted Ms Stangerson earlier in the day than originally thought, but she hid the traces of the attack and locked herself away.  During the night, traumatised by the event, she fell off her bed and inflicted the gravest of the wounds by hitting her temple on the corner of her bed-side table.

The background to these events is kept secret in court but finally explained by Sainclair.

Ms Stangerson had arranged for her son's care and education and hidden the whole saga from her father; her silence and Robert Darzac's behaviour were motivated by her desperation to keep him from finding out.  Ballmeyer however, hearing that she was engaged, had decided to reappear in her life and claim her as his wife once more, by force if necessary.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21520,The Hound of the Baskervilles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles,"InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story ""The Final Problem"". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, ""The King of the Foxes"".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a ""monstrously evil man"". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of ""Love's Old Sweet Song"", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58820,Whose Body? A Lord Peter Wimsey Novel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Body%3F,"Thipps, an architect, finds a dead body wearing nothing but a pair ofpince-nezin the bath of his London flat. Lord Peter Wimsey—a nobleman who has recently developed an interest in criminal investigation as a hobby—resolves to investigate the matter privately. Leading the official investigation is Inspector Sugg, who suggests that the body may be that of the famous financier Sir Reuben Levy, who disappeared from his bedroom in mysterious circumstances the night before. Sir Reuben's disappearance is in the hands ofInspector Charles Parker, a friend of Wimsey's. Although the body in the bath superficially resembles that of Sir Reuben, it quickly becomes clear that it is not him, and it appears that the cases may be unconnected. Wimsey joins Parker in his investigation.

Thipps's flat is near ateaching hospital, and Wimsey considers the possibility that the unexpected appearance of a body may have been the result of a practical joke perpetrated by one of the medical students. However, that is excluded by evidence given at theinquestby the respected surgeon and neurologist Sir Julian Freke, who states that there was no subject missing from his dissecting room.

A prostitute's chance encounter with Levy on the night of his disappearance, on the road leading to the hospital and to Sir Julian Freke's house next door, provides Wimsey with the clue that allows him to link the two cases. Freke maintains that he was being discreetly consulted by Levy about a medical problem, and that Levy left at about 10 pm. Freke's manservant reports that Freke was inexplicably taking a bath at about 3 o'clock the following morning, judging from the noise of the cistern.

Wimsey ultimately discovers that Freke had lured Sir Reuben to his house with the promise of some inside financial information, and had murdered him there. Freke smuggled the body out onto the roof under cover of the cistern noise, took it into the hospital, and substituted it for that of apauperwhich had been donated for dissection by the localworkhouse. He then visited Sir Reuben's home to stage his disappearance, returned, carried the pauper's body over the flat roofs of the nearby houses and placed it in Thipps' bath, entering via a bathroom window that had been left open. As a joke, he added a pair of pince-nez that had by chance come into his possession. Returning to the hospital, he prepared Sir Reuben's body for dissection, giving it to his medical students for that purpose the next day.

Freke unsuccessfully attempts to murder both Parker and Wimsey. When it becomes clear that his actions have been discovered, he prepares a written confession of his long-held desire for revenge: many years earlier, he had hoped to marry the woman who later became Lady Levy, but she had chosen Sir Reuben in preference to him. He had also wanted to substantiate his personal theory of mind – in which conscience, sense of responsibility and so on are merely ""surface symptoms"" which arise from physical irritation or damage to the tissues of the brain. As he completes the confession the police arrive to arrest him, just in time to prevent his suicide.

Initial reviews of the novel in 1923 were largely positive.The New York Timessaid that “there seems to be no reason why the discerning, but by no means infallible, Lord Peter should not become one of the best-known and best-liked among the many amateur detectives of fiction”, while theNew York Heraldcalled the book ""The best detective story we have read since we stopped regarding books purely as amusements”.[3]

In their 1989 review of crime novels, the US writersBarzunand Taylor called the book ""a stunning first novel that disclosed the advent of a new star in the firmament, and one of the first magnitude. The episode of thebumin the bathtub, the character (and the name) of Sir Julian Freke, the detection, and the possibilities in Peter Wimsey are so many signs of genius about to erupt. Peter alone suffers from fatuousness overdone, a period fault that Sayers soon blotted out"".[4]

A. N. Wilson, writing in 1993, noted that ""The publisher made [Sayers] tone the story down, but the plot depends on Lord Peter being clever enough to spot that the body, uncircumcised, is not that of a Jew"".[5]In the 1923 text, Parker says that the body in the bath could not be Sir Reuben Levy because ""Sir Reuben is a pious Jew of pious parents, and the chap in the bath obviously isn't ...""[2]Later versions replaced this with ""But as a matter of fact, the man in the bath is no more Sir Reuben Levy thanAdolf Beck, poor devil, was John Smith"".[6]

In her introduction toHodder & Stoughton's 2016 reprint,Laura Wilsonargued that Wimsey, conceived as a caricature of the gifted amateur sleuth, owes something toP. G. Wodehouse, whoseBertie Woosterhad made his first appearance some years earlier. Sayers said of Wimsey that ""at the time I was particularly hard up and it gave me pleasure to spend his fortune for him. When I was dissatisfied with my single unfurnished room I took a luxurious flat for him in Piccadilly. ... I can heartily recommend this inexpensive way of furnishing to all who are discontented with their incomes"".[7]

In his 2017 overview of the classic crime genre,Martin Edwardssaid that Lord Peter Wimsey began his life as a fantasy figure, created ""as a conscious act of escapism by young writer who was short of money and experiencing one unsatisfactory love affair after another"".[8]

In an article inThe New York Timescommemorating the novel's centenary in 2024,Sarah Weinmanwrote that “What elevated Sayers’s debut to the upper ranks of the genre was the quality of her prose and the sense that her sleuth had more emotional heft than he displayed.” She considered that even after 100 years the story remains a pure pleasure to read.[3]

BBC Radio 4produced a radio dramatisation starringIan Carmichaelas Lord Peter Wimsey andPatricia Routledgeas his mother the Dowager Duchess of Denver."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9551,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes,"All of the stories withinThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesare told in afirst-person narrativefrom the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories.[7]TheOxford Dictionary of National Biographyentry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmestend to point out social injustices, such as ""a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent.""[1]It suggests that, in contrast,  Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of ""official incompetence and aristocratic privilege"".[1]The Adventures of Sherlock Holmescontains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories toThe Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"" (as his favourite), ""The Red-Headed League"" (second), ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (fifth) and ""The Five Orange Pips"" (seventh).[8]The book was banned in theSoviet Unionin 1929 because of its alleged ""occultism"",[9]but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.[10]

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being ""worthy of the inventive genius"" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it ""might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago"", but that ""the unique power"" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, ""with all his little foibles"",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as ""rather a bore sometimes"", noting that descriptions of his foibles ""grows wearisome"".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author ""who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want"".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: ""It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.""[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes ""the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.""[34]

Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921–1923Stoll film series(all except ""The Five Orange Pips""),[35]the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(1930–1936),[36]the 1939–1950 radio seriesThe New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(all except ""The Beryl Coronet""),[37]and the BBC Sherlock Holmes1952–1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in theGranada TelevisionseriesSherlock Holmeswhich ran from 1984 until 1994.[38]The stories inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere dramatised forBBC Radio 4in 1990–1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series,[39]and were adapted as episodes of the radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(2005–2016).[40]The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75840,The trail of the serpent,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trail_of_the_Serpent,"Richard Marwood returns to the home of his mother, Agnes, in Slopperton after an absence of seven years. His uncle, Montague Harding, having recently returned from theEast Indiesafter amassing a large fortune, is also staying there. After a brief reconciliation, Richard leaves swiftly on the encouragement of Montague, who promises him help in turning around his hitherto dissolute lifestyle; on his train journey away from the town, however, he is apprehended by two detectives, Mr. Jinks and themuteJoseph Peters, who charge him with the murder of his uncle on the night of his departure. Peters comes to suspect that Richard is innocent of the murder, and in the trial that follows manages to arrange that hepleads insane; subsequently, Richard is interred in a lunatic asylum. Meanwhile, the orphaned schoolmaster Jabez North kills a child under his care after he threatens to reveal Jabez's suspicious activity on the night of the murder. Later encountering his twin brother, on his deathbed in a derelict neighborhood of Slopperton, he switches places with the dying man; after finding a body on the heath, the police declare Jabez North to have committed suicide.

In Paris, the Spanish heiress Valerie de Cevennes is discovered by Jabez (now under the name of Raymond de Marolles) in a secret marriage with an opera singer, Gaston de Lancy. With the assistance of the fortune-teller and chemist Laurent Blurosset and a mimic, Raymond manipulates Valerie into believing that Gaston has been unfaithful to her, and she poisons him for betraying her trust. In the aftermath of the poisoning, Raymond blackmails Valerie into marrying him.

Eight years later, Richard's confinement is interrupted by the arrival of Joseph Peters' son, Sloshy. (The child is in fact the offspring of Jabez, left to die by its mother when he abandoned her.) Together with Augustus Darley, a friend of Richard's, the pair effect an escape for the prisoner. Subsequently, Richard travels to London and rejoins his former compatriots, the 'Cherokees'; they are later joined by Joseph and the housemaid Kuppins, with whom the detective has brought up Sloshy. The group resolve to vindicate Richard's innocence in the murder of his uncle and to find the guilty person. Meanwhile, Raymond (now the Count de Marolles) has established a household in London with Valerie, now his wife, and her son from her former relationship with Gaston.

Richard and Joseph Peters make headway in confirming that Jabez and Raymond are the same person. Meanwhile, Raymond discovers that the Marquis de Cevennes, Valerie's uncle, is actually his father. Valerie uncovers Raymond's plot, including the use of the mimic to trick her; when she confronts Laurent, however, he reveals that she did not in fact poison Gaston but merely drugged him—after the incident he fled Paris for a military life in India, and goes under the name of Captain Lansdown. Valerie calls her uncle, the Marquis, to London; his paternal connection to Raymond is revealed when the pair confront one another, but the meeting is interrupted by an attempt to apprehend the latter (the evidence of his involvement in the murder having grown in the meantime). Raymond manages to escape them and flees London.

Joseph and Augustus gather more evidence from Slopperton, and visit the house where the murder took place (now vacated by Agnes). The group suspect that Raymond will be on board a ship bound for New York; they eventually find him inside a coffin due to be taken aboard, and he is apprehended. In the subsequent trial, Raymond is found guilty of Montague's murder and sentenced to be hanged; he kills himself before the sentence is carried out. Valerie again marries Gaston, now Captain Lansdown, whilst Richard marries Augustus' sister, Isabella, who supported him during the efforts to prove his innocence; the two couples travel to South America to start new lives there.

Braddon wrote about the composition and publication history of the novel in an essay that first appeared in 1893, entitled 'My First Novel:The Trail of the Serpent'.[2]

The stories were published in theStrand Magazinein Britain andCollier'sin the United States.[2]"
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5164,The Beetle: A Mystery,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beetle_(novel),"The Beetleis told from the point of view of four narrators: Robert Holt, Sydney Atherton, Marjorie Lindon, and Augustus Champnell.

The novel begins by retelling an account of Robert Holt, a clerk who has been searching for a job all day. Denied food and water at aworkhouse, he continues to walk in the dark through the rain until he comes upon an abandoned, dilapidated house with an open window. There he finds shelter and meets a monstrous figure, the mysterious Beetle.

The Beetle takes control of Holt's mind throughmesmerism, allowing him to take human form, and then accuses Holt of being a thief and promises to treat him like one. Then the Beetle forces Holt to take off his clothes and put on new ones in exchange for food and shelter. After that, the Beetle forces a kiss on Holt, which weakens him.

The Beetle plans to send Holt to the home of Paul Lessingham, a member of theHouse of Commons, to steal the letters from the drawer in his desk. When Holt encounters Lessingham, he is to say ""the Beetle,"" which would hinder him. Holt succeeds because the Beetle can control him, but Lessingham captures Holt before he can leave with the letters. Holt shouts ""the Beetle"" twice, in a voice that is not his own, causing Lessingham to shiver in a corner. Holt jumps through a window and escapes. On the street, he is approached by another man, Sydney Atherton, who asks him if he committed a crime against Lessingham. When Holt answers truthfully, Atherton is pleased and lets him go. Holt delivers the letters to the Beetle, who realizes that they are love letters from a certain Marjorie Lindon. The Beetle plans to use her to harm Lessingham.

The narrative perspective switches to Sydney Atherton, who turns out to be Paul Lessingham's romantic rival for the affection of Marjorie Lindon. On the night of Holt's robbery, Atherton proposes to Lindon at a ball. She tells him that she is already engaged to Lessingham but that the engagement has been kept secret because her father is Lessingham's political opponent. Lindon asks Atherton to intercede with her father on Lessingham's behalf, knowing that her father considers Atherton like a son. Consumed by self-pity and anger, Atherton leaves the ball.

After meeting Holt, Atherton visits Lessingham, who insists that he and Lindon are not engaged before sending him away. In his anger, Atherton plans to spend the next day working on hischemical warfareinventions in his laboratory. The Beetle approaches Atherton in his laboratory and tries to mesmerise him like Holt, but Atherton is able to resist. The Beetle then introduces himself as a child ofIsisand promises him Lindon's love if he agrees to help him. Atherton notices that the Beetle has the eyes of a skilled hypnotist and does not decline.

The Beetle leaves, and, shortly after that, Lessingham arrives at Atherton's laboratory. Lessingham apologizes for his rudeness the previous night and asks Atherton not to speak to anyone about it, as he does not want to be bothered by rumours. Atherton agrees, which prompts Lessingham to ask some questions about ancient superstitions and religions, which Atherton has some knowledge of. As Lessingham is about to leave, he sees a picture of a scarab on a shelf and enters acatatonic state, similar to what happened to him when Holt uttered ""the Beetle."" Atherton brings him out of it and promises him not to tell anyone what he just witnessed.

That night, Atherton goes to a ball and manages to secure financing for his experiments from a woman named Dora Grayling. They arrange to meet the next day. Atherton is then approached by his friend, Percy Woodville, whom he takes to the House of Commons to hear Lessingham speak. Lindon is there too, and an altercation between Lindon and Atherton is avoided when Marjorie's father finds out about her and Lessingham, and Lindon runs off with her fiancé. Enraged, Atherton takes Woodville to his laboratory for a demonstration, picking up a stray cat on the way. He uses a concoction of his to kill the cat, fatally wounding Woodville in the process. Atherton brings Woodville to the Beetle and agrees to help him in exchange for his friend's survival. Atherton escapes hypnosis and convinces the Beetle that he too has magic that can make anyone talk. The Beetle tells him that Lessingham killed a woman he was close to in Egypt. When Atherton asks the Beetle why the picture of a scarab frightened Lessingham, the Beetle denies any knowledge. Atherton threatens him, and the Beetle transforms into a scarab. When Atherton tries to capture it, the Beetle changes shape again and flees.

Atherton has forgotten about the appointment and is surprised by Grayling's visit the next day. He does not know that Grayling has feelings for him, and makes several insensitive remarks that cause her to leave in anger. Later, Marjorie Lindon's father visits to talk about how Lessingham is not an appropriate match for his daughter. When Atherton receives a third surprise visit, from Marjorie, her father hides and eavesdrops on their conversation. Marjorie tells him about a half-naked and starving man (Holt) she brought to her house the day before without her father's knowledge after finding him lying in the street. The man had mentioned that Lessingham was in danger, and she wanted to know more about it. Atherton suspects it is the same man he saw leaving Lessingham's house two nights before but does not mention it. Marjorie tells him that she, too, had been attacked by an unseen force that sounded like a beetle. Her father then emerges from his hiding place and accuses her of insanity. Both Lindons leave the house in an agitated state. The fourth coincidental visitor is Lessingham, who wants to know what Atherton has to do with the picture of the scarab and everything else that happened. Although neither speaks openly about it, they agree that Lessingham is haunted, and that if he ensures Lindon won't be dragged into it, Atherton will give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his innocence. Finally, Grayling returns, still wishing to lunch, and Atherton accepts.

The narrative perspective switches again, this time to Marjorie Lindon. Arriving home, Lindon finds that her guest, Holt, is awake, and he tells her his story. Astonished, Lindon sends her servants to fetch Atherton, because she has no one else to turn to. When Atherton arrives, he interrogates Holt enough to confirm his suspicions, but he hopes to keep Lindon out of the matter. He fails, however, and Lindon insists that she go along in search of the Beetle. The three manage to find the house, but it is deserted. Suddenly, Holt is hypnotised again and runs out. Atherton and Lindon agree that he should follow Holt and that she will stay in the house in case the Beetle returns, and that he will send anyone he finds to the house to help her. Only minutes later, Lindon finds that the Beetle is hiding in the house, and her account ends abruptly as she is captured by the Beetle.

The final narrative is given from the perspective of Detective Augustus Champnell. Champnell is finishing up the paperwork on a case when Lessingham enters his office. Lessingham tells him about his connection to the Beetle. Twenty years before, Lessingham decided to go toCairo. Out on his own one night, he was lured by a young woman and was captured by the cult of Isis. In her temple, Lessingham was put into a hypnotic state and forced to obey the orders of the high priestess, called the Woman of the Songs. There he witnessed manyhuman sacrifices, all of them women. After one such sacrifice, the Woman of the Songs' control over him weakened, and he took the opportunity to attack and strangle her until she turned into a scarab. He managed to escape the temple and was found by missionaries and nursed back to health, after which he returned to England. As Lessingham explains his current situation to Champnell, Atherton, a friend of Champnell's, bursts in. Having returned to the house after losing sight of the hypnotized Holt, he discovered that Lindon was missing; he asks Champnell for help in finding her.

The three men quickly make their way to the Beetle's house, but all they find are Lindon's clothes and hair. They inquire at the only other house on the street, which belongs to a Louisa Coleman. She also owns the Beetle's house. She explains that she rented the house to the Beetle, but because she was suspicious, she spied on him. She never saw Lindon leave, but she did see a man leave the house, and shortly after that, she also saw the Beetle leave, carrying a human-sized package. Champnell theorises that the Beetle intends to return to Egypt and that the man was Lindon, dressed in Holt's old clothes. After acquiring information from an officer, the three men follow the Beetle toLondon Waterloo, where they learn that the Beetle boarded a train with two peculiar Englishmen. At the local police station, the men learn that a man who was previously in the company of an ""Arab"" has been found murdered. It turns out to be Holt, but he is in fact still barely alive. Before he collapses, he asks Atherton to save Lindon and confirms that she is the other man. With the help of the police, they find out that the Beetle and Lindon took a train fromLondon St PancrastoHull. They are provided with a special train to catch up with the kidnapper, but their journey ends inLuton, where the train they had been pursuing has derailed. In the chaos, they find Lindon unconscious in one of the front coaches. All that is left of the Beetle are burnt and bloodied rags.

Champnell concludes his narrative by saying the events took place several years before. Lindon has since married Lessingham, who has become a great politician. Atherton and Grayling married after Atherton came to understand the feelings between them. Holt lies buried inKensal Green Cemeteryunder an expensive tombstone. As for the children of Isis, Champnell has learned from good sources that, during an expeditionary advance toDongola, a temple and its occupants - victims of an explosion - were discovered. The corpses were neither men nor women but monstrous creatures, and the remnants of scarab artifacts lay scattered about. Champnell declines to investigate further but hopes that the temple was the one Lessingham spoke of.

The Beetlesold out after its first printing and continued to be published into the 20th century. It initially sold more copies thanBram Stoker'sDracula, which was published in the same year.[1][2][3]Minna Vuohelainen has suggested that the novel'sserialisationinAnswers, where it was first published on 13 March 1897, indicates a larger audience. The entire story was made available over a fifteen-week period ending 19 June. The novel was also published in one volume by a religious publishing house. The title was changed fromThe Peril of Paul Lessingham: The Story of a Haunted MantoThe Beetle: A Mystery.[4]

Vuohelainen provides context for the reappearance ofThe Beetleby tracing its appearance inHughandGraham Greene's collectionVictorian Villainies, which includes a note from the editors that they had ""long felt thatThe Beetle[was] a book which should not be out of print."" The note was also included in the first annotated scholarly edition ofThe Beetle, published by Broadview Press in 2004.

Recently, scholars have taken a renewed interest in Marsh's work. Critics have foundThe Beetleto be a rich source for analysis for areas such aspostcolonial studies,women's studies,post-structuralismandpsychoanalytic studies,narrative studies, and new materialism studies. Research on this text is both abundant and diverse, focusing on narrative and genre,imperialism, alterity,gender performativity, and identity. Scholars such as Minna Vuohelainen,Jack Halberstam,[5]andRoger Luckhurst[citation needed]have discussedThe Beetleas an example of theGothic genre. At the same time, scholars like Rhys Garnett[6]and Victoria Margree began to develop critical arguments that balanced a discussion of imperialism with Victorian anxieties about gender and sexuality.

Many scholars touch on at least the genre, narrative, or form ofThe Beetlein their studies because it differs in all three categories. Minna Vuohelainen's research focuses on the reception and form of the novel.[4]The illustrations included in the first edition help to define arguments about publication and audience, and the change in narrative perspective inThe Beetlehelps make the arguments about serialisation and reception. Themes, motifs, and plot elements such as found-documents, crime, police work, engagement with ancient cultures, complicated love triangles, theuncanny, and monstrosity also point to a strong connection with the Gothic mystery genre.[citation needed]

Some scholars, such as Victoria Margree, placeThe Beetlein the context of imperialism,colonisation, orsovereignty.[7]The Beetlelocates itself in the context of non-Christian spaces outside of a European context, and the novel's title character, the Beetle, is constantly referred to by other characters in the story only as an ""Arab."" This has led critics to callThe Beetlean imperial gothic novel.[citation needed]The Beetle returns to haunt British MP Paul Lessingham, who killed a priestess from thecult of Isisin Egypt twenty years before. Scholars have usedSaid's theory oforientalismto provide productive arguments for engaging this text with a non-European context. Modern scholars such as Ailise Bulfin have attempted to separate appropriated cultural tradition from ambiguity of the text in order to make productive historical arguments about British Imperialism reflected in the novel's genre. For example, Bulfin points to the creation of theSuez Canaland the specifically Egyptian context the novel provides to understand imperial anxieties inVictorian England.[8]

Leslie Allin,[9]Kristen Davis,[10]Dawn Vernooy and W.C. Harris,[11]and Victoria Margree[7]have contributed to a critical understanding of how gender and sexuality interact with interpretive statements about genre, narrative, and realm. The Beetle character presents gender and sexuality in ways that the text makes ambiguous. This has helpedqueer theoristslike Thomas Stuart to destabilize assumptions about the social construction of gender in Victorian England.[12]In particular, the Beetle demands that Holt undresses before taking the form of an ailing male figure with a complicated female presence and then kissing him. Sydney Atherton is another complicated character, obsessed with his own masculinity in comparison to his romantic rival Lessingham. In addition, Marjorie Lindon defies the expectations of the female gender by refusing to be controlled by the male characters in the novel, whether they are members of her family or seeking her affection.[citation needed]

Thomas Stuart,[12]Anna Maria Jones,[13]and Graeme Pedlingham[14]have made connections between the indeterminacy they perceived inThe Beetleand new materialisms. They have attempted to explain the mutability of objects and the object relations that inform the novel's characters and motifs. For example, Jones makes connections tothermodynamicsand thelaw of conservation of energyto make arguments for the scientific and social anxieties addressed inThe Beetle. Although the novel has only attracted scholarly interest since its republication in the 1980s, it has been discussed in various interpretive approaches.[13]

In November 1919, the Britishsilent film,The Beetle, directed byAlexander Butlerand starringMaudie DunhamandHebden Foster, was released.[15]The silent version is consideredlost. Nine years later, in October 1928, a stage adaptation by producer and playwrightJ. B. Fagan, starringCatherine Lacey, was performed at theStrand Theatre.[16]Another adaptation, written by Roger Danes, was broadcast byBBC Radio 4in 1997; it was repeated in 2014[17]and 2021."
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21586,The Sign of the Four,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four,"In 1888 MissMary Morstanarrives with a case. She explains that ten years earlier, her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, disappeared immediately after arriving in London. Mary contacted his friend, Major Sholto, who denied having seen him. Four years later, she received a valuable pearl in the post, a gift repeated once a year for six years. With the sixth pearl, she received a letter asking for a meeting, claiming that she is a ""wronged woman"".

Holmes takes the case, and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died a week before Mary received the first pearl. The only further clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk, appended with the words ""The Sign of the Four: Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar,"" and four small cross-like symbols.

Following the letter's instructions, Holmes, Watson, and Mary go to theLyceum Theatre; there, they meet a coachman who takes them to the house of Major Sholto's son Thaddeus, the anonymous sender of the pearls. He reveals that Captain Morstan did, in fact, visit Major Sholto, demanding his half of a treasure that Sholto had secretly brought back fromIndia. In the ensuing quarrel, Captain Morstan suffered a heart attack and died, striking his head on the treasure box as he fell. Afraid he would be suspected of murder, Major Sholto buried the body and hid the treasure, leaving out a small goldchapletstudded with twelve pearls. Thaddeus and his twin brother Bartholomew only learned of this when their father revealed it while on his deathbed; he was about to reveal to them where the treasure was hidden, when a bearded man appeared at the window and the Major died of fear. The brothers tried and failed to catch the intruder; later on, they found a note pinned to the Major's body, which read ""The Sign of Four"". Thaddeus began sending Mary the pearls to make things right, and the brothers searched for the treasure. Six years later, Bartholomew found and withheld it; Thaddeus then contacted Mary so they could both confront Bartholomew and demand their shares.

The party, now accompanied by Thaddeus, heads to Bartholomew's house, Pondicherry Lodge,Upper Norwood. As they enter the house, the worried housekeeper reveals that Bartholomew has locked himself in his laboratory and refuses to come out. Mary Morstan stays downstairs to comfort the housekeeper, while the others rush up to the laboratory door; through the keyhole, they can see Bartholomew Sholto slumped in his chair,  with a ""fixed and unnatural grin"" upon his face. Holmes and Watson break down the door, to discover Bartholomew in a state ofrigor mortis. Upon further inspection of the body, Holmes discovers a poisonous thorn above Bartholomew's ear. The treasure box is also gone, though there is a hole in the ceiling where it used to be.

While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces from footmarks and other clues that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged white man named Jonathan Small, and a smallAndamaneseaccomplice, who accidentally stepped increosote. Borrowing Toby, a trained scent hound, from a naturalist, Holmes traces the pair to a boat landing. Learning that Small has hired a steamlaunchnamed theAurora, Holmes, with the help of theBaker Street Irregularsand his own disguises, traces the boat to arepair yard. In a police launch, Holmes and Watson pursue theAurorawhen it flees the yard; the islander attempts to shoot a dart at Holmes, and is shot dead himself. Small attempts to flee, running theAuroraaground, but is captured. However, the treasure box is now empty; Small, not wanting to surrender the gems, had scattered them into theThamesduring the chase.

Small confesses that he was once a soldier of the ThirdBuffsin India, and lost his right leg to acrocodilewhile bathing in theGanges. He then became an overseer on anindigoplantation; the1857 rebellionoccurred, and he was forced to flee to theAgra fortress. While standing guard one night, he was overpowered bySikhtroopers, who gave him a choice; be killed, or help themwaylayAchmet, a disguised servant of an outlawedrajah, who had sent Achmet with a box of jewellery to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place, but the crime was discovered, although the hidden jewels were not. Small and his accomplices got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands.

Some years later, Small learned that Major Sholto and Captain Morstan, who were guards at the convict barracks, had lost money playing cards. Small saw his chance, and made a deal with the officers; Sholto would recover the treasure, and in return send a boat to pick up Morstan, Small, and the Sikhs so they could all meet and divide it. However, Sholto stole the treasure for himself, returning to England after inheriting a fortune from his uncle. Morstan went after Sholto but never returned, and Small vowed vengeance against Sholto. Four years later, Small escaped prison with the help of Tonga, an islander whose life he had once saved. It was the news of this escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location, but left the note in the room anyway as revenge for the treatment of himself and the Sikhs. When Bartholomew eventually found the treasure, Small only planned to steal it; however, a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew before Small could stop him. Small decides the treasure brings nothing but bad luck to anyone who has it; to Achmet and Bartholomew, death; to Major Sholto, fear and guilt; and for Small himself, penal servitude for life.

Mary is left with no treasure, save the pearls; however, she and Watson have fallen in love over the course of the adventure, and the loss of the treasure has removed anybarriersthere might have been between them. Watson reveals that he has proposed to Mary and that she has accepted, much to the annoyance of Holmes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyledescribed how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner withJoseph Marshall Stoddart, managing editor of the American publicationLippincott's Monthly Magazine, at theLangham Hotelin London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version ofLippincott’swith a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended byOscar Wilde, who eventually contributedThe Picture of Dorian Grayto the July 1890 issue.[1]Doyle discussed what he called this ""golden evening"" in his 1924autobiographyMemories and Adventures.

The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition ofLippincott's Monthly Magazine[2]asThe Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos, appearing in both London andPhiladelphia.[3]The British edition of the magazine originally sold for ashilling, and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars.

Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re-serialisations gave the title asThe Sign of Four. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 bySpencer Blackett, again using the titleThe Sign of Four.[1]This edition included a frontispiece illustrated byCharles H. M. Kerr.[4]The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second ""the"" of the original title.

AGermanedition of the book published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. An edition published byGeorge Newnes Ltdin 1903 was illustrated byF. H. Townsend.[5]

Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four-word form.[1]The actual text in the novel nearly always uses ""the Sign of the Four"" (the five-word form) to describe the symbol in the story, although the four-word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story.

As with the first story,A Study in Scarlet, produced two years previously,The Sign of the Fourwas not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards inStrand Magazine, that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.

There have been multiple film and television adaptations of the book:

A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on New York radio stationWGYon 9 November 1922. The cast included Edward H. Smith as Sherlock Holmes, F. H. Oliver as Dr. Watson, and Viola Karwowska as Mary Morstan. It was produced as part of a series of adaptations of plays, so it is likely that the script was based on an existing stage adaptation of the story (one was written by John Arthur Fraser in 1901 and another by Charles P. Rice in 1903).[6]

A six-part adaptation of the novel aired in the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Adapted byEdith Meiser, the episodes aired from 9 November 1932 to 14 December 1932, withRichard Gordonas Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.[7]

The book was adapted byFelix Feltonfor theBBC Light Programmein 1959.Richard Hurndallplayed Holmes andBryan Colemanplayed Watson.[8]

On Saturday 2 March 1963, the story was dramatised byMichael Hardwickfor theBBC Home Serviceas part of the1952–1969 radio series, as a ninety-minute episode onSaturday-Night Theatre, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson.[9]

CBS Radio Mystery Theateraired a radio version of the story in 1977, starringKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[10]

The Sign of the Fourwas adapted for radio byBert Coulesin 1989 as part ofBBC Radio 4's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series, withClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, and featuringBrian Blessedas Jonathan Small.[11]

In 2016, the story was adapted as an episode of the American radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.[12]

In 2024, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the story in a ten-episodes adventure called ""The Sign of Four"", starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

Paul Giovanni's 1978 playThe Crucifer of Bloodis based on the novel. The Broadway premiere featuredPaxton Whiteheadas Holmes and Timothy Landfield as Watson. The 1979 London production featuredKeith Michellas Holmes andDenis Lillas Watson."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21522,The innocence of Father Brown,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Broken_Sword,"On a frigid winter's night in England, Father Brown and his friend Hercule Flambeau visit a lonely churchyard and view the monumental tomb, with a broken sword alongside the recumbenteffigy, of the late British General Sir Arthur St. Clare, who is adulated by the British public (and American tourists) as a war hero. On their ensuing long walk to the nearest inn, Father Brown relates to Flambeau the true story of the general's death.

During a fictional 19th-century military conflict between Britain and Brazil, General St. Clare commanded 800 British infantry in a campaign against the Brazilian general Olivier, a charismatic and generous enemy. St. Clare led two or three British regiments in a reckless assault on Brazilian positions, in the course of which his troops suffered heavy casualties and had to surrender. Olivier paroled his prisoners, but soon after, St. Clare was found hanging from a tree, his broken sword hanging around his neck.

Father Brown reveals that St. Clare, in the course of his military career in India and Africa, engaged in torture, fornication, and corruption and ultimately sold England's military secrets to the Brazilians. Major Murray, one of St. Clare's officers, uncovered the treason and demanded St. Clare resign. St. Clare murdered him, the point of the general's sword breaking off in the major's body. Coldly calculating, St. Clare ordered a doomed assault, making ""a hill of corpses to cover this one."" The surviving British troops led by Captain Keith, who later married the general's daughter, deduced the truth and lynched St. Clare as soon as the Brazilians departed.

As he and Flambeau arrive at a cozy country inn, Father Brown vows not to publicize the truth about the general's execution by his own men. ""There is so much good and evil in breaking secrets that I put my conduct to a test,"" says Brown. ""All these newspapers will perish. The anti-Brazil boom is already over. Olivier is already honoured everywhere. But I told myself that if anywhere, by name, in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids, Colonel Clancy or Captain Keith or President Olivier or any innocent man was wrongly blamed, then I would speak. If it were only that St. Clare was wrongly praised I would be silent. And I will.”[1]

""The Sign of the Broken Sword"" has received attention from literary critics and philosophers. Argentine writerJorge Luis Borges, who admired Chesterton, took the story as thehypotextfor his own story, ""Theme of the Traitor and the Hero.""[2]Per Emma McEvoy, the revelation of St. Clare's villainy and Olivier's generosity reflects that ""Chesterton delighted in setting up straw men—the bogies of a lingering Victorian imperialism—as potential villains.""[3]Joshua Hren argues that Father Brown's decision not to denounce St. Clare, thereby dethroning ""the god of this country,"" reflectsAquineannotions of prudence.[4]Gregory Fried uses Chesterton's story as a vehicle for analysis and response to an essay (""Why Heidegger Made the Right Step in 1933"") by philosopherSlavoj Žižek.[5]

""The Sign of the Broken Sword"" was first published in the January 7, 1911, issue ofThe Saturday Evening Postand illustrated by the popular American novelist and illustratorGeorge Fort Gibbs. It was the sixth Father Brown story to appear in print.[1]The story was reprinted inThe Innocence of Father Brown(1911), the first compilation of Father Brown stories.[6]

""The Sign of the Broken Sword"" influenced Jorge Luis Borges's ""Theme of the Traitor and the Hero,"" a 1944 short story in which a fictional Irish revolutionary named Fergus Kilpatrick betrays his comrades and consents to his assassination by them in such a manner as to strengthen the Irish nationalist cause. The traitor/hero's biographer, Ryan, chooses to leave the myth intact.[2]

Chesterton's story was adapted for Season 3 of the TV seriesFather Brown. The episode aired in 2015 onBBC One, withAngus Wrightplaying Colonel Laurence St. Clare (renamed from the original villain). Screenwriters changed the setting to the twentieth century and the Battle of the Black River to theBattle of Dunkirk. Brazil and Olivier do not feature in the adaptation.[7]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69404,You can't win,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Win_(book),"The book tells of Black's experiences in thehobounderworld, freight-hopping around the western United States and Canada, with the majority of events taking place from the late 1880s to around 1910. He tells of becoming a thief, burglar, and member of theyegg(safe-cracking) subculture, exploring the topics of crime, criminal justice, vice, addictions,penology, and human folly from various viewpoints, from observer to consumer to supplier, and from victim to perpetrator.

You Can't Winoriginally appeared in serial format in theSan Francisco Call-Bulletinunder the editorship ofFremont Older.[1]It was so popular that it was reissued in book format byMacMillanand became a best-seller.[1]It has been translated into Russian, Swedish, French, and other languages.[1]

After the book's publication, Black spent several years lecturing at women's clubs and lived in New York. Black spent his summers in a cabin on Older's property in California, next to a pool.[1]When MacMillan asked Black to write another book, he was too weak even to swim, according to Older.[1]He didn't write another book.

The main criminal activity described in Black's life and in the book is thievery, which leads to discussions of various technical aspects of the thief's ""trade"", including casing of prospects (surveillance of targets),safe-cracking,fencingof stolen goods, the disposal of evidence, maintaining aliases and avoiding attention or traceability, the social networks of criminals, the experiences of being arrested, questioned, and tried, and the experience of doing time in jails and prisons.

The vices and addictions Black discusses include alcoholism, abuse of opium (hop), gambling, prostitution, and stealing. In his own telling, Black does not seem to have an especial weakness for addictions (for example, he did not become alcoholic himself), but he does describe the addictive allure that gambling and opium held for him in various stages of his life. He expresses an opinion that drug addiction is more psychological than physical; nevertheless, he also admits that breaking himself of a daily opium habit was the toughest battle of his life.

Themes that Black explores through anecdotes from his life include:

William S. Burroughsfirst read the book as an adolescent and citedYou Can't Winas influential in his life and writing, mentioning the autobiography in his 1953 bookJunkie.[2]He wrote a foreword to the 1988 edition ofYou Can't Winwhich was reprinted in the 2000 edition.

The book has been adapted to a film titledYou Can't Win(in post-production as of January 2020) starringJulia Garner,Jeremy Allen WhiteandMichael Pitt, who co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay.[3][4]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3070,The Hound of the Baskervilles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles,"InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story ""The Final Problem"". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, ""The King of the Foxes"".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a ""monstrously evil man"". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of ""Love's Old Sweet Song"", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]

The desk is subsequently stolen, as it turns out, by Arsène Lupin. Later, both Lupin and the professor realize that a lottery ticket, left inadvertently in the desk, is the winning ticket, and Lupin proceeds to ensure he obtains half of the winnings while executing a near-impossible escape with a blonde lady. After the theft of the Blue Diamond, again by a blonde lady, Ganimard made the connection to Lupin and an appeal was made to Herlock Sholmes to match wits with Lupin. Inadvertently, Lupin and his biographer met with the newly arrived Sholmes and his assistant,Dr. Wilson, in a Parisian restaurant, and they shared a cautiousdétentebefore Lupin sets off to lay his traps. Despite Lupin's efforts, Sholmes is able to unveil the identity of the blonde lady and Lupin's involvement in the crimes linked to her. Lupin succeeds in trapping Sholmes, however, and sends him off toSouthamptonin a boat, but Sholmes manages to escape back to Paris and engineer the arrest of Lupin. After Sholmes leaves, however, Lupin outfoxes his French captors and manages to bid farewell to Sholmes and Wilson at theGare du Nord.

""The Jewish Lamp"" opens with another appeal to Herlock Sholmes for help in recovering a Jewish lamp. After reading the appeal, Sholmes is shocked to read a second letter, this time by Lupin and arriving on the same day's post, which warns him not to intervene. Sholmes is outraged by Lupin's audacity and resolves to go to Paris. At the Gare du Nord, Sholmes is accosted by a young lady, who again warns him not to intervene, and finds that the Echo de France, Lupin's mouthpiece newspaper, is proclaiming his arrival. Sholmes proceeds to investigate the crime and finds out the true reason for Lupin's appeal not to intervene.

A 1910 film serial entitledArsène Lupin contra Sherlock Holmesadapted Leblanc's stories. German copyright laws allowed the producers to return ""Sholmes"" to the proper ""Sherlock Holmes"" who was portrayed byViggo Larsen.[3]

In the 2015 video gameThe Great Ace Attorney: Adventures, a character namedHerlock Sholmesappears in the English translation in reference to the Leblanc book. The name Sherlock Holmes was avoided due to legal complications, as the Doyle character was still partially protected by copyright in the United States when the game was released.[4]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70008,Unnatural death,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnatural_Death_(novel),"Lord Peter Wimseyand his friendChief Inspector Parkerhear about the death, in late 1925, of an elderly cancer sufferer named Agatha Dawson who was being cared for by her great-niece Mary Whittaker. Miss Dawson had an aversion to making a will and believed that, if she died without one, Miss Whittaker, her only known relative, would automatically inherit everything.

Wimsey is intrigued despite there being no evidence of any crime having been committed. He sends his private investigator,Miss Katharine Climpson, to investigate. She discovers that shortly before Miss Dawson's death her maids, the sisters Bertha and Evelyn Gotobed, had been dismissed. Wimsey asks his solicitor friend John Murbles to place advertisements in the press asking them to get in touch. A few days later, Bertha is found dead inEpping Forest. On the body is a £5 banknote, originally issued to a Mrs Muriel Forrest who lives in an elegant flat in London'sSouth Audley Street.

Wimsey and Parker visit her. She claims not to remember the banknote, but thinks she may have used it to bet on a horse. Wimsey tricks her into providing her fingerprints on a wineglass. In a drawer he finds a hypodermic syringe with a doctor's prescription: ""to be injected when the pain is very severe"".

Evelyn Gotobed tells Wimsey of an episode shortly before the sisters were dismissed in which Miss Whittaker had tried, unsuccessfully, to get them to witness Miss Dawson signing her will.

Wimsey visits a West Indian clergyman named Hallelujah Dawson, now in London. It seems that he may be a cousin of Miss Dawson, and a closer relative than Miss Whittaker. He has a large family and is in need of funds.

Wimsey learns of a motive for Miss Dawson to be killed before the end of 1925: a new'Property Act', due to come into force on 1 January 1926, that changed the law ofintestacy. Until 1925, theestateof a person dying without a will always passed to the closest relative, no matter how remote. From 1926, in the absence of near relatives the estate is forfeit tothe Crown, leaving  distant relations such as a great-niece with nothing.

Wimsey visits Mrs Forrest at her flat, where she unsuccessfully tries to drug him. She makes rather clumsy advances, and Wimsey suspects blackmail. He kisses her, realises that she is physically revolted, and slips away.

Miss Climpson reports that Mary Whittaker ""is not of the marrying sort"". Whittaker disappears along with her besotted young female admirer, Vera Findlater. Several days later, Miss Findlater's body is found on thedowns, brutally disfigured by a blow to the head. There is no sign of Mary Whittaker. A distinctive cap and male footprints nearby suggest a link with Hallelujah Dawson. However, thepost mortemfinds that Vera Findlater was already dead when she was struck. Close inspection reveals that the footprints have been faked, and that the scene has been set up in order to frame the innocent clergyman. Tyre tracks from Mrs Forrest's car cause Wimsey to suspect her and Mary Whittaker of acting in collusion.

Wimsey's manservant,Bunter, realises that the fingerprints on Mrs Forrest's wineglass are identical to those on a cheque written by Miss Whittaker. Wimsey at last understands that Muriel Forrest and Mary Whittaker are one and the same person. She carried out the murders by injecting air into her victims' bloodstream with her hypodermic syringe, causingblockageand immediate death through heart failure.

Miss Climpson heads to South Audley Street where she finds Mary Whittaker in her disguise as Mrs Forrest. She attacks Miss Climpson, who is saved from becoming another fatality by the timely arrival of Wimsey and Parker.

Whittaker is committed to prison to await trial. There, she commits suicide. Wimsey is sickened by the killer's evil and greed. Coming out of the prison on a sunny day with Parker, he finds a darkened world: they have emerged just at the time of thetotal solar eclipse.

According toJames Brabazonin his biography of Sayers, she drew her ingenious and medically doubtful murder method from her familiarity with motor engines, gained from her affair with a car mechanic and motor-bike enthusiast.[3]

In their review of crime novels, the US writersBarzunand Taylor stated that ""The tale is perhaps a little forced in conception and remote in tone. That is the trouble with all the great masters – they accustom us to such dazzling performances that when they give us what would seem wonderful coming from other hands, we sniff and act choosy.  The mode of compassing death has been carped at, but no one could do anything but rejoice at Miss Climpson and her subterfuges.""[4]

HRF Keating, writing in 1989, noted that Sayers had ""invented a murder method that is appropriately dramatic and cunningly ingenious, the injection of an air-bubble with a hypodermic"". However, ""not only would it require the use of an instrument so large as to be farcical, but Miss Sayers has her bubble put into an artery not a vein. No wonder afterwards she pledged herself 'strictly in future to seeing I never write a book which I know to be careless'.""[5]

InMurder in the Closet: Essays on Queer Clues in Crime Fiction before Stonewall(2017), Noah Stewart described Mary Whittaker as being ""to my knowledge the most clearly delineated homosexual character in Golden Age detective fiction, despite the word 'lesbian' never being used, and she's depicted as enticing a young girl into a life of homosexuality"". The episode in which Mary Whittaker is kissed by Wimsey is ""the closest that a writer in 1927 would be able to come to saying that a character was a lesbian and that kissing a man made her want to vomit.""[6]Laura Vorachek argued that, in the novel, ""Sayers attempts to challenge the prevalent cultural associations of blackness and criminality.""[7]

On 1 January 1926, the date specified by Sayers, two important property statutes came into force in England: theLaw of Property Act 1925and theAdministration of Estates Act 1925. The latter, corresponding most closely with the ‘Property Act’ of the novel, swept away the old rules onintestacy[8]and specified by way of a six-point list the persons who would inherit if the intestate left neitherissuenor parents. If the deceased had no surviving relatives of the classes mentioned (which did not include great-niece), the estate would go tothe Crown.[9]

In May 1975, anadaptationwas made forBBC Radio 4, produced bySimon Brettand starringIan Carmichaelas Lord Peter Wimsey.[10]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59828,"The String of Pearls; Or, The Barber of Fleet Street. A Domestic Romance.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_String_of_Pearls,"The story is set in London during the year 1785. The plot concerns the strange disappearance of a sailor named Lieutenant Thornhill, last seen entering Sweeney Todd's establishment on Fleet Street. Thornhill was bearing a gift of astring of pearlsto a girl namedJohanna Oakleyon behalf of her missing lover, Mark Ingestrie, who is presumed lost at sea. One of Thornhill's seafaring friends, Colonel Jeffrey, is alerted to the disappearance of Thornhill by his faithful dog, Hector, and investigates his whereabouts. He is joined by Johanna, who wants to know what happened to Mark.

Johanna's suspicions of Sweeney Todd's involvement cause her to dress as a boy and become Todd's employee after his last assistant, a young boy namedTobias Ragg, has been incarcerated in amadhousefor accusing Todd of being a murderer. Soon, after Todd has dismembered the corpses of his victims, Mrs. Lovettcreates her meat pies from leftover flesh.  While the bodies are burning in the oven, a ghastly and intolerable smell reeks from the pie shop chimney.  Eventually, the extent of Todd's activities is uncovered when the dismembered remains of hundreds of his victims are discovered in thecryptunderneath St. Dunstan's church. Meanwhile, Mark, who has been imprisoned in the cellar beneath the pie shop and made to work as the cook, escapes via theliftused to bring the pies up from the cellar into the pie shop. Here he makes the following startling announcement to the customers of that establishment:

Mrs. Lovett is thenpoisonedby Sweeney Todd, who is subsequently apprehended and hanged. Johanna marries Mark.

The String of Pearls: A Romancewas published in 18 weekly parts, inEdward Lloyd'sThe People's Periodical and Family Library, issues 7–24, 21 November 1846 to 20 March 1847. It is frequently attributed toThomas Peckett Prest, but has been more recently been reassigned toJames Malcolm Rymer;[2]other names such as E.P Hingston have also been suggested. E.P. Hingston, at the time, was a resident of London. It is written like so many of his other works. E.P. Hingston at the time of this writing was looking for a way to make money until he set off on one of his new escapades. The story was then published in book form in 1850 as ""The String of Pearls"", subtitled ""The Barber of Fleet Street. A Domestic Romance"". This expanded version of the story was 732 pages long, and its conclusion differs greatly from that of the original serial publication: Todd escapes from prison after beingsentenced to deathbut, after many further adventures, is finally shot dead while fleeing from the authorities. In later years, there were many different literary,stageand eventuallymovie adaptationswhich renamed, further expanded and often drastically altered the original story.[1]

A scholarly,annotated editionofThe String of Pearlswas published in 2007 by theOxford University Presswith the titleSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, edited by Robert Mack.

Industrialisationis a theme that contributes to the story. Sweeney Todd owns a barber shop in the middle of one of the busiest industrial parts of the growing city of London. Industrialism resulted in an increasing crime rate, which was exploited by the penny dreadful stories.

While the author ofString of Pearlsis unknown, there are many theories surrounding its influences. During the 19th century, when this story was first written, a semi-common trade was what was termed abarber-surgeon. Barber-surgeons were medical practitioners trained not by schooling but byapprenticeship, and they were sometimesilliterate.Surgeryeventually became an established profession of its own and the two were separated legally byKing George IIin Britain during 1745.[3]

The 1612 French historical nonfiction bookLe Théâtre des Antiquités de Parisby FatherJacques du Breul[fr]contains a section titledDe la maison des Marmousets(From the house of the Marmousets) that mentions a ""murderous pastry cook"" who incorporates into his pie the meat of a man he murdered due to its alleged dietary benefits.[4]

It has been speculated that, ""Joseph Fouché, who served as Minister of Police inParisfrom 1799 to 1815, had records in the archives of police that explored murders committed in the 1800s by a Parisian barber"".[5]Fouché mentioned that the barber was in league with ""a neighbouring pastry cook, who made pies out of the victims and sold them for human consumption"".[5]There is question about the authenticity of this account, ""yet the tale was republished in 1824 under the headlineA Terrific Story of the Rue de Le Harpe, ParisinThe Tell Tale, a London magazine. Perhaps Thomas Prest, scouring publications for ideas, read about the Paris case and stored it away for later use.""[5]

Sweeney Todd's story also appears inThe Newgate Calendar, originally a bulletin of executions produced by the keeper ofNewgate Prison, the title of which was appropriated bychapbooks, popularpamphletsfull of entertaining, often violent criminal activities.[6]Despite this, there is no mention of Todd's trial or execution in official records, and thus no real evidence that he ever existed.[6]

Nopublic recordsprove any existence of a London barber by the name of Sweeney during the 18th century or of a barber shop located onFleet Street. There were manyword-of-mouth,true crimeand horror stories at the time however, reported in ""The Old Bailey"" section of theTimes of Londonas well as otherdaily newspapers. News also commonly travelled by word of mouth as the majority of the population was still illiterate, and could become embellished in the retelling from person to person. Such news might still be assumed factual because there was no way of proving otherwise at the time.[7]

InCharles Dickens'The Pickwick Papers(1836–37), Pickwick'scockneyservant Sam Weller states that a pieman used cats ""forbeefsteak,vealandkidney, 'cording to the demand"", and recommends that people should buy pies only ""when you know the lady as made it, and is quite sure it ain't kitten"".[8]Dickens expanded on the idea of using non-traditional sources for meat pie inMartin Chuzzlewit(1843–44). This was published two years beforeThe String of Pearls(1846–47) and included a character by the name of Tom Pinch, who feels lucky that his own ""evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many country legends as doing a lively retail business in the metropolis"" and worries that John Westlock will ""begin to be afraid that I have strayed into one of those streets where the countrymen are murdered; and that I have been made into meat pies, or some such horrible thing"".[9][10]Peter Hainingsuggested in a 1993 book that Dickens was inspired by knowledge of the ""real"" Sweeney Todd, but that he chose not to mention him, in case some of his victims' relatives were still alive.[6]"

F. X. Van Dusenas the main character,[3]although most of the story is seen through the perspective of aprisonwarden.  While in a scientific debate with two men, Dr. Charles Ransome and Alfred Fielding, Augustus, ""The Thinking Machine"", insists that nothing is impossible when the human mind is properly applied.  To prove this, he agrees that he will take part in an experiment in which he will be incarcerated in a prison for one week and given the challenge of escaping.[4]

The story was adapted for television by Arthur A. Ross in1962as part of theU.S.seriesKraft Mystery Theater. The episode starredClaude Dauphinas Van Dusen, and was awarded the1963Edgar Awardfor Best Episode in a TV Series.[5]

""Cell 13"", a1973adaptation for theBritishseriesThe Rivals of Sherlock Holmes, featuredDouglas Wilmer, famous for his portrayal ofHolmesin BBC productions of the sixties, as the Professor.[6]

In1978,West Berlinradio stationRIASproduced and broadcast ""Das sicherste Gefängnis der Welt"" (The Safest Prison in the World), aradio playbased on the story. This was the second of 79 Van Dusen stories so adapted.[7]

In 2011, the story was adapted forBBC Radio 4's seriesThe RivalsbyChris Harrald.  The story was directed bySasha Yevtushenkoand starredPaul Rhysas Professor Van Dusen.

A stage version premiered at Broadway Onstage in Michigan in 2011. Adapted by John Arden McClure, it starred Donald Couture as the warden, and Sarah Oravetz as the Hutchinson Hatch character, changed to Anne Hatch in this version.

On the NBC seriesThe Blacklist, specifically the episode aired January 18, 2019 titled ""The Pawn Brokers"", main character Raymond Reddington established contact outside prison with an identical rat-and-thread technique.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173,The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Dr._Fu-Manchu,"Dr. Petrie is surprised by a late night visitor, ""a tall, lean ... square cut ... sun baked"" man who turns out to be his good friend (ex-Assistant Commissioner Sir Denis) Nayland Smith ofBurma, formerly ofScotland Yard, who has come directly from Burma. We then learn that various men associated with India are the target of assassination by the Chinese master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu, who seems to have been active in Burma (as distinct from India), in places such asRangoon,Prome,Moulmeinand the ""UpperIrrawaddy"" and who comes to England withdacoitsandthugs.

Fu Manchu is pursued from theopium densofLimehousein theEast Endof London to various country estates. We learn that Dr. Fu Manchu is a leading member not of ""old China"", theMandarinclass of theManchudynasty, or ""young China"", a new generation of ""youthful and unbalanced reformers"" with ""western polish"" – but a ""Third Party"". Nayland Smith is outwitted several times by Fu Manchu and thus he reflects more the narrow escapes of the laterBulldog Drummondrather than the ""logical"" superior approach of the earlierSherlock Holmes.

Fu Manchu is a master poisoner and chemist, a cunning member of theYellow Peril, ""the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put on the earth for centuries"", though his mission is not exactly clear at this stage. He appears to be trying to capture and take back to China the best engineers of Europe for some larger criminal purpose.

By the end of the book, Fu Manchu's slave girl Karamaneh, a beautiful Arab woman, apparently now in love with Dr Petrie, and her brother Aziz are freed from Fu Manchu's captivity, and Inspector Weymouth, driven mad by an injection of serum from Fu Manchu, is restored to sanity by Fu Manchu, who appears to have escaped from a fire which destroys the house that he had previously entered.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172,The Haunted Bookshop,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunted_Bookshop,"The narrative begins with a young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert, stopping by a bookstore named ""The Haunted Bookshop"" in the hopes of finding a new client. Gilbert meets the proprietor, Roger Mifflin. Gilbert does not succeed in selling advertising copy, but is intrigued by Mifflin and his conviction concerning the value books and booksellers have to the world. Additionally, Gilbert is intrigued by the fact that his firm's biggest client, Mr. Chapman, is a friend of Mifflin and has asked Mifflin to undertake the education of his daughter, Titania Chapman, by hiring her as an assistant.

Gilbert returns to the book store, meets Titania, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, mysterious things start to happen: a copy ofThomas Carlyle'sLetters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwelldisappears and reappears, Gilbert is attacked as he travels home, a pharmacist neighbor of Mifflin is observed skulking in the alley behind the bookstore at night speaking to someone in German, and an assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel has posted an ad inThe New York Timespromising a reward for a lost copy ofLetters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. Gilbert starts to sense that something nefarious is afoot. He suspects that the gregarious Mifflin is involved in a plot to kidnap Titania, and he assigns himself the job of protecting her.

Meanwhile, Mifflin begins to train Titania in the booksellers' trade. His focus is so centered on books and their content that he fails to note the unusual things that are occurring.

Gilbert takes a room across from the bookstore in order to keep eye on things, and believes his suspicions confirmed when he sees the pharmacist let himself into the bookshop with his own key late at night. Gilbert breaks into the bookshop in an effort to find evidence to prove his suspicions, but only manages to frighten and anger Titania.

Gilbert learns that Mifflin is to take a day trip to Philadelphia, and follows him in the belief that the trip is a part of the ""kidnapping"" plot. In Philadelphia Gilbert confronts Mifflin with his suspicions, telling him of all the things that have occurred. The two realize that a third party had lured Mifflin away from the shop. They call the bookshop and learn that the pharmacist has left a suitcase of books there for someone else to pick up. Mifflin tells Titania to hold on to the case until he returns.

Mifflin and Gilbert return to the bookshop and find it locked. Inside, the pharmacist and an associate of his have tied up Mrs. Mifflin and are menacing Titania with a gun.

A fight ensues, part of the bookstore is destroyed by a bomb, and the pharmacist escapes. The only casualties of the bomb are the pharmacist's partner and Mifflin's dog, Bock. Mifflin even affects to be pleased as the blast knocked down books he'd forgotten he had.

In the final chapter of the book Gilbert and Mifflin learn what the true plot was: The pharmacist was a German spy who had been using the bookshop as a drop-off point. He was a specialist in making bombs, and had hidden a bomb in one of PresidentWoodrow Wilson's favorite books. The pharmacist's co-conspirator was the assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel. He was to be part of the crew on the ship Wilson was to travel on to peace talks in Europe, and was to plant the bomb in Wilson's cabin in an assassination plot. The pharmacist was captured by police, and killed himself.

This is primarily a novel of suspense, though throughout it Morley proclaims the value of books. Mifflin, the protagonist, is a self-described ""practitioner of bibliotherapy"" who thinks booksellers heal minds just like doctors heal bodies. Mifflin describes a ""librocubicularist"" as someone who is fond of readings in bed.[1]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34079,Tajemnica Baskerville'ów: dziwne przygody Sherlocka Holmes (Polish),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles,"InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story ""The Final Problem"". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, ""The King of the Foxes"".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a ""monstrously evil man"". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of ""Love's Old Sweet Song"", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]

The Hound of the Baskervilleshas been adapted in various forms of media.

Over 20 film and television versions ofThe Hound of the Baskervilleshave been made.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73547,The case of Charles Dexter Ward,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_of_Charles_Dexter_Ward,"Charles Dexter Ward is a young man from a prominentRhode Islandfamily who has disappeared from amental asylum. He had been incarcerated during a prolonged period of insanity, during which he exhibited minor and inexplicable physiological changes. His empty cell is found to be very dusty. The bulk of the story concerns the investigation conducted by the Wards' family doctor, Marinus Bicknell Willett, in an attempt to discover the reason for Ward's madness and physiological changes. Willett learns that Ward had spent the past several years attempting to discover the grave of his ill-reputed ancestor, Joseph Curwen.

The doctor slowly begins to reveal the truth behind the legends surrounding Curwen, an eighteenth-centuryshippingentrepreneurand allegedalchemist, who was in reality anecromancerandmass murderer. A raid on Curwen's farm was remarkable for the shouted incantations, lights, explosions, and some not-quite-human figures shot down by the raiders. The raiders swore any witnesses to strict secrecy about what they saw and heard.

As Willett's investigations proceed, he finds that Charles had recovered Curwen's ashes, and through the use ofmagical formulaecontained in documents found hidden in Curwen's home inProvidencewas able to call forth Curwen from his ""essential saltes"" and resurrect him. Willett also finds that Curwen, who resembles Charles enough to pass for him, murdered and replaced his modern descendant and resumed his evil activities. Although Curwen convinces onlookers that he is Charles, his anachronistic mindset and behavior lead authorities to certify him insane and imprison him in an asylum.

While Curwen is locked up, Willett's investigation leads him to abungalowinPawtuxet Village, which Ward had purchased while under the influence of Curwen. The house is on the site of the old farm which was Curwen's headquarters for his nefarious doings; beneath is a vast catacomb that the wizard had built as a lair during his previous lifetime. During a horrific journey through this labyrinth, in which Willett sees a deformed monster in a pit, he discovers the truth about Curwen's crimes and also the means of returning him to the grave. It is also revealed that Curwen has been engaged in a long-termconspiracywith certain other necromancers, associates from his previous life who have somehow escaped death, to resurrect and torture the world's wisest people to gain knowledge that will make them powerful and threaten the future of mankind.

While in Curwen's laboratory, Willett accidentally summons an ancient entity who is an enemy of Curwen and his fellow necromancers. The doctor faints, awakening much later in the bungalow. The entrance to the vaults has been sealed as if it had never existed, but Willett finds a note from the being written inLatininstructing him to kill Curwen and destroy his body. Willett confronts Curwen at the asylum and succeeds in reversing the resurrection spell, returning the sorcerer to dust. News reports reveal that Curwen's prime co-conspirators and their households have met brutal deaths, and their lairs have been destroyed.

Ward is born in 1902; he is 26 in 1928, at the time the story takes place. Though considered one of Lovecraft's autobiographical characters, some details of the character seem to be based on William Lippitt Mauran, who lived in the Halsey house and, like Ward, was ""wheeled...in a carriage"" in front of it. Like the Wards, the Maurans also owned a farmhouse inPawtuxet, Rhode Island.[1]

Ward's ancestor (great-great-great-grandfather)[2]and dead ringer, a successful merchant, shipping magnate,slave trader, and highly accomplished sorcerer, born in what is nowDanvers, Massachusetts, seven miles fromSalem, on February 18, 1662. He flees to Providence from theSalem witch trialsin 1692. He dies, at least temporarily, in 1771 in the course of a raid on his lair by a group of important Providence citizens (Abraham Whipple,JohnandMoses BrownandEsek Hopkinsamong them) who have got wind of only a few of his crimes. He is killed again, presumably for good, by Dr Willett using Curwen's own sorcery. Curwen perfects a method of reducing the effects of aging to an uncanny degree. He also has the ability to resurrect the dead from either the complete corpse or its ""essential saltes"" (derived from the ashes of said corpse), and converse with them. This ability is used to obtain privileged intelligence from long-defunct wise men. To this end his agents scour the graveyards and tombs of the world for the corpses of illustrious persons which are then smuggled back to Providence, where Curwen temporarily raises them to torture their secrets out of them. In this endeavour he is assisted by two fellow necromancers and Salem exiles; Jedediah/Simon Orne, alias Joseph Nadek, who lives inPrague, and Edward Hutchinson, who masquerades as Baron Ferenczy inTransylvania.

He is able to summon entities such asYog-Sothothto assist him in his magic. The ultimate goal of these men's activities, i.e. the nature or the use for the information extracted from the resurrected wise persons, is not completely specified and its interpretation is largely left to the reader. This ambiguity also affects,[3]notably, the exact circumstances of Curwen's ""first"" death. It is evident he was betrayed and probably killed by the entity summoned in his defense during the siege to the hidden grounds of his farm, but the identity of this being, as well as its possible connection withYog-Sothoth(whose name is mentioned in the incantations) is left open to speculation. It is significant, however, that the entity's irruption during the confrontation elicits ""An unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream"", as well as ""a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness [that] wrenched from scores of human throats—a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst"", and that the participants of the raid are left withpsychological sequelsfar beyond those expected in any episode of unconventional warfare.

Prior to his first death, Curwen finds a way to create a spell that would transcend time and inspire a descendant to become interested in him and his work and attempt to bring him back should he ever be slain. When later resurrected by Ward, Curwen initially goes in disguise as a bearded, spectacled ""Dr. Allen"" to avoid suspicion due to his close resemblance to Ward. The undead Curwen showed vampiristic tendencies as a side effect of his resurrection, thereby attacking local travelers and breaking into houses to drink the blood of the inhabitants. Curwen immediately made contact with Orne and Hutchinson, who have been alive and active all the while, and starts up his old plots once again. He soon murders Ward when he starts having doubts about what they are doing and assumes his identity. Curwen never hesitates to stoop to murder, torture or blackmail to achieve his ends; he also uses – and kills – vast numbers of living slaves as subjects for his experiments. He also feigns some degree of civic spirit and decency, both to his fellow citizens and to his wife, as part of a clever ruse—a social gambit aimed at producing an heir, as well as improving his public image to avoid forced displacement.

An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopediacompares Willett's character to other ""valiant counterweight[s]"" in Lovecraft such as Thomas Malone in ""The Horror at Red Hook"" (1925)[4]and Henry Armitage in ""The Dunwich Horror""; like Willett, Armitage ""defeats the 'villains' byincantations, and he is susceptible to the same flaws—pomposity, arrogance, self-importance—that can be seen in Willett.""[5]

In August 1925, Lovecraft's Aunt Lillian sent him an anecdote about the house at 140 Prospect Street, built in 1801 by Colonel Thomas Lloyd Halsey inProvidence, Rhode Island. Lovecraft wrote back, ""So the Halsey house is haunted! Ugh! That's where Wild Tom Halsey kept liveterrapinsin the cellar—maybe it's their ghosts. Anyway, it's a magnificent old mansion, & a credit to a magnificent old town!""[6]Lovecraft would make this house—renumbered as 100 Prospect—the basis for the Ward house. The following month, September 1925, Lovecraft readProvidence in Colonial Times, by Gertrude Selwyn Kimball, a 1912 history that provided him the anecdotes about John Merritt and Dr. Checkley that he incorporated into his novel.[4]

A possible literary model isWalter de la Mare's novelThe Return(1910), which Lovecraft read in mid-1926. He describes it in his essay ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"" as a tale in which ""We see the soul of a dead man reach out of its grave of two centuries and fasten itself on the flesh of the living.""[1]

The theme of a descendant who closely resembles a distant ancestor may come fromNathaniel Hawthorne'sThe House of the Seven Gables, which Lovecraft called ""New England's greatest contribution toweird literature"" in ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"".[7]

Another proposed literary source isM. R. James' short story ""Count Magnus"", also praised in ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"", which suggests the resurrection of a sinister 17th century figure.[8]

The germ of inspiration came from Lovecraft readingCotton Matherand running across a quote fromBorellus. Borellus is Petrus Borellus, also known as Pierre Borel, a well-known French doctor and alchemist. The quote refers to old experiments of the alchemists in creating life/rebirth from death using essential salts. The entire quote (which is actually a paraphrasing by Mather) is as follows:

Lovecraft himself was displeased with the novel, calling it a ""cumbrous, creaking bit of self-conscious antiquarianism"".[10]He made little effort to publish the work, leaving it to be published posthumously inWeird TalesbyAugust DerlethandDonald Wandrei.

Writing in theNew York Times,reviewer William Poster describedWardas ""a good story in the New England witchcraft tradition, well seasoned with alchemy, vampirism, ancient documents and mummy-stealing"".[11]Horror historianLes DanielscalledThe Case of Charles Dexter WardLovecraft's ""finest novel"".[12]E. F. Bleilernoted that the short novel, ""despite its being strangely tired and routine, has interesting concepts and good moments"".[13]Baird Searlesfound that ""HPL's great knowledge of New England history provides a convincing background"" for the story.[14]Douglas Robillard stated Lovecraft's negative assessment ofThe Case of Charles Dexter Wardwas ""too harsh; this is one of his finest works"".[15]

The Case of Charles Dexter Wardcontains the first mention of theCthulhu MythosentityYog-Sothoth, who appears repeatedly as an element in an incantation. Joseph Curwen is the owner of a copy of theNecronomiconand there are hints of cult activities in a fishing village that refer obliquely to the events narrated in ""The Festival"". The story also contains references to theDream Cycle: Dr. Willett notices the ""Sign of Koth"" chiselled above a doorway, and remembers his friendRandolph Carterdrawing the sign and explaining its powers and meaning.

Brian Lumleyexpanded on the character of Baron Ferenczy, mentioned but never met inThe Case of Charles Dexter Ward, in hisNecroscopeseries, specificallyBook IV: Deadspeak, where Janos Ferenczy uses the Yog-Sothoth formula to call forth whole bodies from ash remains, and to return them to that state.

When Dexter's mother hears chanting (""per adonai eloim, adonai jehova, adonai sabaoth, metraton on agla mathon, verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, conventus, antra gnomorum, daemonia coeli gad, almousin, gibor, jehosua, evam, zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.""), the chanting is quoted (along with many other incantations in the story) fromEliphas Levi'sTranscendental Magic,[16]which translates the passage as ""By Adonaï Eloïm, Adonaï Jehova, Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Adonaï Mathon, the pythonic word, the mystery of the salamander, the assembly of sylphs, the grotto of gnomes, the demons of the heaven of Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua, Evam, Zariatnatmik, Come, Come, Come!"" The incantation invokes several divine names, such as Adonai, Eloim, and Jehova, and references the Salamander, Sylphs, and Gnomes, which are the alchemical representatives of Fire, Air, and Earth respectively, as described byParacelsus. The ""mystery of the salamander"" is also referenced in other short stories.

The novel was adapted by artistI.N.J. Culbardin 2012, in acomic bookpublished bySelf Made Herounder the novel's title, featuring a foreword by comic book creatorJeff Lemire. The art in this rendition was described by one critic as ""a brilliant job of communicating [a] vision of a rotting afterlife to... readers.""[22]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58238,Sämtliche Werke 1-2 :  Rodion Raskolnikoff (Schuld und Sühne) (German),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in a tiny rented room in Saint Petersburg. Isolated and antisocial, he has abandoned all attempts to support himself and is brooding obsessively on a scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawnbroker. On the pretext of pawning a watch, he visits her apartment, but he remains unable to commit himself. Later in a tavern, he makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Marmeladov tells him about his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has become aprostitutein order to support the family. The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister Dunya, who has been working as a governess, with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov. To escape her vulnerable position, and with hopes of helping her brother, Dunya has chosen to marry a wealthy suitor, Luzhin, whom they are coming to meet in Petersburg. Details in the letter suggest that Luzhin is a conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of Dunya's situation. Raskolnikov is enraged at his sister's sacrifice, feeling it is the same as what Sonya felt compelled to do. Painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence, his thoughts return to his idea. A further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it.

In a state of extreme nervous tension, Raskolnikov steals an axe and makes his way once more to the old woman's apartment. He gains access by pretending he has something to pawn, and then attacks her with the axe, killing her. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime. Shaken by his actions, he steals only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawnbroker's wealth untouched. Due to sheer good fortune, he manages to escape the building and return to his room undetected.

In a feverish and semi-delirious state Raskolnikov conceals the stolen items and falls asleep exhausted. He is greatly alarmed the next morning when he gets summoned to the police station, but it turns out to be in relation to a debt notice from his landlady. When the officers at the bureau begin talking about the murder, Raskolnikov faints. He quickly recovers, but he can see from their faces that he has aroused suspicion. Fearing a search, he hides the stolen items under a large rock in an empty yard, noticing in humiliation that he has not even checked how much money is in the purse. Without knowing why, he visits his old university friend Razumikhin, who observes that Raskolnikov seems to be seriously ill. Finally he returns to his room where he succumbs to his illness and falls into a prolonged delirium.

When he emerges several days later he finds that Razumikhin has tracked him down and has been nursing him. Still feverish, Raskolnikov listens nervously to a conversation between Razumikhin and the doctor about the status of the police investigation into the murders: amuzhikcalled Mikolka, who was working in a neighbouring flat at the time, has been detained, and the old woman's clients are being interviewed. They are interrupted by the arrival of Luzhin, Dunya's fiancé, who wishes to introduce himself, but Raskolnikov deliberately insults him and kicks him out. He angrily tells the others to leave as well, and then sneaks out himself. He looks for news about the murder, and seems almost to want to draw attention to his own part in it. He encounters the police official Zamyotov, who was present when he fainted in the bureau, and openly mocks the young man's unspoken suspicions. He returns to the scene of the crime and re-lives the sensations he experienced at the time. He angers the workmen and caretakers by asking casual questions about the murder, even suggesting that they accompany him to the police station to discuss it. As he contemplates whether or not to confess, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage. He rushes to help and succeeds in conveying the stricken man back to his family's apartment. Calling out for Sonya to forgive him, Marmeladov dies in his daughter's arms. Raskolnikov gives his last twenty five roubles (from money sent to him by his mother) to Marmeladov's consumptive widow, Katerina Ivanovna, saying it is the repayment of a debt to his friend.

Feeling renewed, Raskolnikov calls on Razumikhin, and they go back together to Raskolnikov's building. Upon entering his room Raskolnikov is deeply shocked to see his mother and sister sitting on the sofa. They have just arrived in Petersburg and are ecstatic to see him, but Raskolnikov is unable to speak, and collapses in a faint.

Razumikhin tends to Raskolnikov, and manages to convince the distressed mother and sister to return to their apartment. He goes with them, despite being drunk and rather overwhelmed by Dunya's beauty. When they return the next morning Raskolnikov has improved physically, but it becomes apparent that he is still mentally distracted and merely forcing himself to endure the meeting. He demands that Dunya break with Luzhin, but Dunya fiercely defends her motives for the marriage. Mrs Raskolnikova has received a note from Luzhin demanding that her son not be present at any future meetings between them.  He also informs her that he witnessed her son give the 25 rubles to ""an unmarried woman of immoral behavior"" (Sonya). Dunya has decided that a meeting, at which both Luzhin and her brother are present, must take place, and Raskolnikov agrees to attend that evening along with Razumikhin. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Sonya suddenly appears at his door. Timidly, she explains that he left his address with them last night, and that she has come to invite him to attend her father's funeral. As she leaves, Raskolnikov asks for her address and tells her that he will visit her soon.

At Raskolnikov's behest, Razumikhin takes him to see the detective Porfiry Petrovich, who is investigating the murders. Raskolnikov immediately senses that Porfiry knows that he is the murderer. Porfiry, who has just been discussing the case with Zamyotov, adopts an ironic tone during the conversation. He expresses extreme curiosity about an article that Raskolnikov wrote some months ago called 'On Crime', in which he suggests that certain rare individuals—the benefactors and geniuses of mankind—have a right to 'step across' legal or moral boundaries if those boundaries are an obstruction to the success of their idea. Raskolnikov defends himself skillfully, but he is alarmed and angered by Porfiry's insinuating tone. An appointment is made for an interview the following morning at the police bureau.

Leaving Razumikhin with his mother and sister, Raskolnikov returns to his own building. He is surprised to find an old artisan, whom he does not know, making inquiries about him. Raskolnikov tries to find out what he wants, but the artisan says only one word – ""murderer"", and walks off. Petrified, Raskolnikov returns to his room and falls into thought and then sleeps. He wakens from an eerie nightmare about the murder of the old woman to find another complete stranger present, this time a man of aristocratic appearance. The man politely introduces himself as Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov.

Svidrigailov indulges in an amiable but disjointed monologue, punctuated by Raskolnikov's terse interjections. He claims to no longer have any romantic interest in Dunya, but wants to stop her from marrying Luzhin, and offers her ten thousand roubles. Raskolnikov refuses the money on her behalf and refuses to facilitate a meeting. Svidrigailov also mentions that his wife, who defended Dunya at the time of the unpleasantness but died shortly afterwards, has left her 3000 rubles in her will.

The meeting with Luzhin that evening begins with talk of Svidrigailov—his depraved character, his presence in Petersburg, the unexpected death of his wife and the 3000 rubles left to Dunya. Luzhin takes offence when Dunya insists on resolving the issue with her brother, and when Raskolnikov draws attention to the slander in his letter, Luzhin becomes reckless, exposing his true character. Dunya tells him to leave and never come back. Now free and with significant capital, they excitedly begin to discuss plans for the future, but Raskolnikov suddenly gets up and leaves, telling them, to their great consternation, that it might be the last time he sees them. He instructs the baffled Razumikhin to remain and always care for them.

Raskolnikov proceeds to Sonya's place. She is gratified that he is visiting her, but also frightened of his strange manner. He asks a series of merciless questions about her terrible situation and that of Katerina Ivanovna and the children. Raskolnikov begins to realize that Sonya is sustained only by her faith in God. She reveals that she was a friend of the murdered Lizaveta. In fact, Lizaveta gave her a cross and a copy of the Gospels. She passionately reads to him the story of the raising of Lazarus from the Gospel of John. His fascination with her, which had begun at the time when her father spoke of her, increases and he decides that they must face the future together. As he leaves he tells her that he will come back tomorrow and tell her who killed her friend Lizaveta.

When Raskolnikov presents himself for his interview, Porfiry resumes and intensifies his insinuating, provocative, ironic chatter, without ever making a direct accusation. With Raskolnikov's anger reaching fever pitch, Porfiry hints that he has a ""little surprise"" for him behind the partition in his office, but at that moment there is a commotion outside the door and a young man (Mikolka the painter) bursts in, followed by some policemen. To both Porfiry and Raskolnikov's astonishment, Mikolka proceeds to loudly confess to the murders. Porfiry does not believe the confession, but he is forced to let Raskolnikov go. Back at his room Raskolnikov is horrified when the old artisan suddenly appears at his door. But the man bows and asks for forgiveness: he had been Porfiry's ""little surprise"", and had heard Mikolka confess. He had been one of those present when Raskolnikov returned to the scene of the murders, and had reported his behavior to Porfiry.

Raskolnikov attends the Marmeladovs' post-funeral banquet at Katerina Ivanovna's apartment. The atmosphere deteriorates as guests become drunk and the half-mad Katerina Ivanovna engages in a verbal attack on her German landlady. With chaos descending, everyone is surprised by the sudden and portentous appearance of Luzhin. He sternly announces that a 100-ruble banknote disappeared from his apartment at the precise time that he was being visited by Sonya, whom he had invited in order to make a small donation. Sonya fearfully denies stealing the money, but Luzhin persists in his accusation and demands that someone search her. Outraged, Katerina Ivanovna abuses Luzhin and sets about emptying Sonya's pockets to prove her innocence, but a folded 100-ruble note does indeed fly out of one of the pockets. The mood in the room turns against Sonya, Luzhin chastises her, and the landlady orders the family out. But Luzhin's roommate Lebezyatnikov arrives, and angrily asserts that he saw Luzhin surreptitiously slip the money into Sonya's pocket as she left, although he had thought at the time that it was a noble act of anonymous charity. Raskolnikov backs Lebezyatnikov up by confidently identifying Luzhin's motive: a desire to avenge himself on Raskolnikov by defaming Sonya, in hopes of causing a rift with his family. Luzhin is discredited, but Sonya is traumatized, and she runs out of the apartment. Raskolnikov follows her.

Back at her room, Raskolnikov draws Sonya's attention to the ease with which Luzhin could have ruined her, and consequently the children as well. But it is only a prelude to his confession that he is the murderer of the old woman and Lizaveta. Painfully, he tries to explain his abstract motives for the crime to uncomprehending Sonya. She is horrified, not just at the crime, but at his own self-torture, and tells him that he must hand himself in to the police. Lebezyatnikov appears and tells them that the landlady has kicked Katerina Ivanovna out of the apartment and that she has gone mad. They find Katerina Ivanovna surrounded by people in the street, completely insane, trying to force the terrified children to perform for money, and near death from her illness. They manage to get her back to Sonya's room, where, distraught and raving, she dies. To Raskolnikov's surprise, Svidrigailov suddenly appears and informs him that he will be using the ten thousand rubles intended for Dunya to make the funeral arrangements and to place the children in good orphanages. When Raskolnikov asks him what his motives are, he laughingly replies with direct quotations of Raskolnikov's own words, spoken when he was trying to explain his justifications for the murder to Sonya. Svidrigailov has been residing next door to Sonya, and overheard every word of the murder confession.

Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that Dunya has become troubled and distant after receiving a letter from someone. He also mentions, to Raskolnikov's astonishment, that Porfiry no longer suspects him of the murders. As Raskolnikov is about to set off in search of Svidrigailov, Porfiry himself appears and politely requests a brief chat. He sincerely apologises for his previous behavior and seeks to explain the reasons behind it. Strangely, Raskolnikov begins to feel alarmed at the thought that Porfiry might think he is innocent. But Porfiry's changed attitude is motivated by genuine respect for Raskolnikov, not by any thought of his innocence, and he concludes by expressing his absolute certainty that Raskolnikov is indeed the murderer. He claims that he will be arresting him soon, but urges him to confess to make it easier on himself. Raskolnikov chooses to continue the struggle.

Raskolnikov finds Svidrigailov at an inn and warns him against approaching Dunya. Svidrigailov, who has in fact arranged to meet Dunya, threatens to go to the police, but Raskolnikov is unconcerned and follows when he leaves. When Raskolnikov finally turns home, Dunya, who has been watching them, approaches Svidrigailov and demands to know what he meant in his letter about her brother's ""secret"". She reluctantly accompanies him to his rooms, where he reveals what he overheard and attempts to use it to make her yield to his desire. Dunya, however, has a gun and she fires at him, narrowly missing: Svidrigailov gently encourages her to reload and try again. Eventually she throws the gun aside, but Svidrigailov, crushed by her hatred for him, tells her to leave. Later that evening he goes to Sonya to discuss the arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna's children. He gives her 3000 rubles, telling her she will need it if she wishes to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. He spends the night in a miserable hotel and the following morning commits suicide in a public place.

Raskolnikov says a painful goodbye to his mother, without telling her the truth. Dunya is waiting for him at his room, and he tells her that he will be going to the police to confess to the murders. He stops at Sonya's place on the way and she gives him a crucifix. At the bureau, he learns of Svidrigailov's suicide, and almost changes his mind, even leaving the building. However, he sees Sonya (who has followed him) looking at him in despair, and he returns to make a full and frank confession to the murders.

Due to the fullness of his confession at a time when another man had already confessed, and his state of mind at the time of the murders, Raskolnikov is sentenced to only eight years of penal servitude. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and plan to move to Siberia, but Raskolnikov's mother falls ill and dies. Sonya follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, but he is initially hostile towards her as he is still struggling to acknowledge moral culpability for his crime, feeling himself to be guilty only of weakness. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence.

InCrime and Punishment, Dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character,Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of ""ideological intoxication,"" and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychological consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov's psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught.[24]From another point of view, the novel's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, ""Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society asHonoré de Balzac'sRastignacorStendhal'sJulien Sorel, but to those of rationalistic Petersburg"".[25]

Raskolnikov(Rodion Romanovitch) is theprotagonist, and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective. A 23-year-old former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov is described in the novel as ""exceptionally handsome, taller than average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair."" On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of impulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it.

Despite its title, the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment as with Raskolnikov's internal struggle – the torments of his own conscience, rather than the legal consequences of committing the crime. Believing society would be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possesses enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.

Sonya(Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova) is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and innocent, despite being forced into prostitution to help her family. Raskolnikov discerns in her the same feelings of shame and alienation that he experiences, and she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime. Sensing his deep unhappiness, she supports him, even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov.

Razumíkhin(Dmitry Prokofyich) is Raskolnikov's loyal friend and also a former law student. The character is intended to represent something of a reconciliation between faith and reason (razum, ""sense"", ""intelligence""). He jokes that his name is actually Vrazumíkhin – a name suggesting ""to bring someone to their senses"".[26]He is upright, strong, resourceful and intelligent, but also somewhat naïve – qualities that are of great importance to Raskolnikov in his desperate situation. He admires Raskolnikov's intelligence and character, refuses to give any credence to others' suspicions, and supports him at all times. He looks after Raskolnikov's family when they come to Petersburg, falling in love with and later marrying Dunya.

Dunya(Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) –  Raskolnikov's beautiful and strong-willed sister who works as a governess. She initially plans to marry the wealthy but unsavory lawyer Luzhin, thinking it will enable her to ease her family's desperate financial situation and escape her former employer Svidrigailov. Her situation is a factor in Raskolnikov's decision to commit the murder. In St. Petersburg, she is eventually able to escape the clutches of both Luzhin and Svidrigailov, and later marries Razumikhin.

Luzhin(Pyotr Petrovich) – A well-off lawyer who is engaged to Dunya in the beginning of the novel. His motives for the marriage are dubious, as he more or less states that he has sought a woman who will be completely beholden to him. He slanders and falsely accuses Sonya of theft in an attempt to harm Raskolnikov's relations with his family. Luzhin represents immorality, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.

Svidrigaïlov(Arkady Ivanovich) – Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and former pursuer of Dunya. He overhears Raskolnikov's confessions to Sonya and uses this knowledge to torment both Dunya and Raskolnikov, but does not inform the police. Despite his apparent malevolence, Svidrigaïlov seems to be capable of generosity and compassion. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go. He tells Sonya that he has made financial arrangements for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage, and gives her three thousand rubles, enabling her to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. Having left the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée, he commits suicide.

Porfiry Petrovich– The head of the Investigation Department in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does this through psychological means, seeking to confuse and provoke the volatile Raskolnikov into a voluntary or involuntary confession. He later drops these methods and sincerely urges Raskolnikov to confess for his own good.

Dostoevsky's letter to Katkov reveals his immediate inspiration, to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into a much more ambitious creation: a desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines ofRussian nihilism.[27]In the novel, Dostoevsky pinpointed the dangers of bothutilitarianismandrationalism, the main ideas of which inspired the radicals, continuing a fierce criticism he had already started with hisNotes from Underground.[28]Dostoevsky utilized the characters, dialogue and narrative inCrime and Punishmentto articulate an argument againstWesternizingideas. He thus attacked a peculiar Russian blend of Frenchutopian socialismandBenthamiteutilitarianism, which had developed under revolutionary thinkers such asNikolai Chernyshevskyand became known asrational egoism.
The radicals refused to recognize themselves in the novel's pages, since Dostoevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences.Dimitri Pisarevridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of the time. The radicals' aims were altruistic and humanitarian, but they were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing the spontaneous outflow of Christian compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.[29]Dostoevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.[30]

Raskolnikov exemplifies the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal. Contemporary scholar Joseph Frank writes that ""the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity on the one hand and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd"".[31]Raskolnikov's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and ""useless"" old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoevsky wants to show that this utilitarian style of reasoning had become widespread and commonplace; it was by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov's tormented and disordered mind.[32]Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov's character, and help justify his contempt for humanity's lower qualities and ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher social good, believes that he possesses a moral right to kill. Indeed, his ""Napoleon-like"" plan impels him toward a well-calculated murder, the ultimate conclusion of his self-deception with utilitarianism.[33]

Dostoevsky was among the first to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regardsCrime and Punishmentas the first great Russian novel ""in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor"".[34]

Dostoevsky's Petersburg is the city of unrelieved poverty; ""magnificence has no place in it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold"". Dostoevsky connects the city's problems to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions.[35]The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that ""the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched.""[36]

In his depiction of Petersburg, Dostoevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov's eyes. He uses Raskolnikov's encounter with Marmeladov to contrast the heartlessness of Raskolnikov's convictions with a Christian approach to poverty and wretchedness.[32]Dostoevsky believes that the moral ""freedom"" propounded by Raskolnikov is a dreadful freedom ""that is contained by no values, because it is before values"". In seeking to affirm this ""freedom"" in himself, Raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God.[37]He thinks that he is self-sufficient and self-contained, but at the end ""his boundless self-confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself, and his self-fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God"".[38]Dostoevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of ""sick"" Russian society through the re-discovery of its national identity, its religion, and its roots.[39]

The novel is divided into six parts, with anepilogue. The notion of ""intrinsic duality"" inCrime and Punishmenthas been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree ofsymmetryto the book.[40]Edward Wasiolek, who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure ofCrime and Punishmentto a ""flattened X"", saying:

This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel's six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as David Bethea has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the ""left"" half of the novel reflects the ""right"" half.[40]

The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky's critics have criticized the novel's final pages as superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy of the rest of the work,[42]while others have defended it, offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues thatCrime and Punishment""is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale"".[43]Cassedy concludes that ""the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue inCrime and Punishment... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue"".[44]

Crime and Punishmentis written from athird-personomniscient perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov, but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as Svidrigaïlov, Razumikhin, Luzhin, Sonya or Dunya. This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters, was original for its period. Frank notes that Dostoevsky's use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments ofHenry James,Joseph Conrad,Virginia Woolf, andJames Joyce. A late nineteenth-century reader was, however, accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration. This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman, and to observations like the following byMelchior de Vogüé: ""A word ... one does not even notice, a small fact that takes up only a line, have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [so that] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages"".[45]

Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters. Those who use artificial language—Luzhin, for example—are identified as unattractive people. Mrs. Marmeladov's disintegrating mind is reflected in her language. In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters have something of adouble meaning, but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture. For example, the original Russian title (""Преступление и наказание"") is not the direct equivalent to the English ""Crime and Punishment"". ""Преступление"" (Prestupléniye) is literally translated as 'a stepping across'. The physical image of crime as crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation, as is the religious implication of transgression.[46]

The first part ofCrime and Punishmentpublished in the January and February issues ofThe Russian Messengermet with public success. In his memoirs, the conservative belletristNikolay Strakhovrecalled thatCrime and Punishmentwas the literary sensation of 1866 in Russia.[47]Tolstoy's novelWar and Peacewas being serialized inThe Russian Messengerat the same time asCrime and Punishment.

The novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations, and wondered, ""Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?"" Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value, described Raskolnikov as a product of his environment, and argued that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy with which Dostoevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: ""This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it.""[48][49]Solovyov felt that the meaning of the novel, despite the common failure to understand it, is clear and simple: a man who considers himself entitled to 'step across' discovers that what he thought was an intellectually and even morally justifiable transgression of an arbitrary law turns out to be, for his conscience, ""a sin, a violation of inner moral justice... that inward sin of self-idolatry can only be redeemed by an inner act of self-renunciation.""[50]

The earlySymbolistmovement that dominated Russian letters in the 1880s was concerned more with aesthetics than the visceral realism and intellectuality ofCrime and Punishment, but a tendency toward mysticism among the new generation of symbolists in the 1900s led to a reevaluation of the novel as an address to the dialectic of spirit and matter.[51]In the character of Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna) they saw an embodiment of both the Orthodox feminine principle ofhagia sophia(holy wisdom) – ""at once sexual and innocent, redemptive both in her suffering and her veneration of suffering"", and the most important feminine deity of Russian folkloremat syra zemlya(moist mother earth).[52]Raskolnikov is a ""son of Earth"" whose egoistic aspirations lead him to ideas and actions that alienate him from the very source of his strength, and he must bow down to her before she can relieve him of the terrible burden of his guilt.[53][54]Philosopher and Orthodox theologianNikolay Berdyaevshared Solovyov and the symbolists' sense of the novel's spiritual significance, seeing it as an illustration of the modern age's hubristic self-deification, or what he calls ""the suicide of man by self-affirmation"". Raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will, but, according to Berdyaev, these are questions that can only be answered by God, and ""he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself: that is the meaning ofCrime and Punishment"".[55][56]

Crime and Punishmentwas regarded as an important work in a number of 20th-century European cultural movements, notably theBloomsbury Group,psychoanalysis, andexistentialism. Of the writers associated with Bloomsbury,Virginia Woolf,John Middleton MurryandD. H. Lawrenceare some of those who have discussed the work.Freudheld Dostoevsky's work in high esteem, and many of his followers have attempted psychoanalytical interpretations of Raskolnikov.[57]Among the existentialists,SartreandCamusin particular have acknowledged Dostoevsky's influence.[58]

The affinity ofCrime and Punishmentwith both religious mysticism and psychoanalysis led to suppression of discussion inSovietRussia: interpretations of Raskolnikov tended to align with Pisarev's idea of reaction to unjust socio-economic conditions.[59]An exception was the work ofMikhail Bakhtin, considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of Dostoevsky's work. InProblems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, Bakhtin argues that attempts to understand Dostoevsky's characters from the vantage point of a pre-existing philosophy, or as individualized ""objects"" to be psychologically analysed, will always fail to penetrate the unique ""artistic architechtonics"" of his works.[60]In such cases, both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are monological: everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of a single overarching perspective, whether that of the critic or that of the author. Dostoevsky's art, Bakhtin argues, is inherently dialogical: events proceed on the basis of interaction between self-validating subjective voices, often within the consciousness of an individual character, as is the case with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov's consciousness is depicted as a battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel: everyone and everything he encounters becomes reflected and refracted in a ""dialogized"" interior monologue.[61]He has rejected external relationships and chosen his tormenting internal dialogue; only Sonya is capable of continuing to engage with him despite his cruelty. His openness to dialogue with Sonya is what enables him to cross back over the ""threshold into real-life communication (confession and public trial)—not out of guilt, for he avoids acknowledging his guilt, but out of weariness and loneliness, for that reconciling step is the only relief possible from the cacophony of unfinalized inner dialogue.""[62]

The Garnett translation was the dominant translation for more than 80 years after its publication in 1914. Since the 1990s, McDuff and Pevear/Volokhonsky have become its major competitors.[63]"

He has come about some missing, secret submarine plans. Seven of the ten missing papers were found with Arthur Cadogan West's body, but the three ""most essential"" papers are still missing. West was a young clerk in a government office atRoyal Arsenal,Woolwich, whose body was found next to theUndergroundtracks near theAldgate tube station, his head crushed. He had little money with him (although there appears to have been no robbery), theatre tickets, and curiously, no Underground ticket.

Inspector Lestradetells Holmes that a passenger reported hearing a thud, as though a body had fallen on the track, close to where West's body was found. The passenger could not see anything, however, owing to the thick fog. After an examination of the track near Aldgate, Holmes concludes that West had been killed elsewhere, was deposited on the roof of an Underground train, and fell off when the jarring action of going across arailway pointat Aldgate shook the coach.

Holmes decides to visit Sir James Walter, who was in charge of the papers. He has, however, died, apparently of a broken heart from the loss of his honour when the papers were stolen, according to his brother Colonel Valentine Walter. On visiting West's fiancée, Holmes learns that West had something on his mind for the last week or so of his life; he  had commented on how easily a traitor could get hold of ""the secret"" and how much foreign agents would pay for it. On the night in question, West and his fiancé were on their way to the theatre, when he suddenly dashed off into the fog and did not return.

Holmes next goes to the office from which the plans were stolen. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, tells Holmes that, as always, he was the last man out of the office that night, and that he had put the papers in the safe. Anyone coming in afterwards to steal them would have needed three keys (for the building, the office, and the safe), but no duplicates were found on West's body, and only the late Sir James had all three keys. Johnson also mentions that one of the seven recovered papers includes a unique invention, without which the submarine could not be properly built. Holmes also discovers that it is possible to see what is happening inside the office from outside, as the iron shutters do not close properly.

After leaving, Holmes finds that the clerk at the nearby Underground station remembers seeing West on the evening in question.  Deeply shaken by something, he had taken a train toLondon Bridge.

Acting on information from Mycroft, and on what he has learnt thus far, Holmes identifies a person of interest: Hugo Oberstein, a known foreign agent who left town shortly after West's murder. Some small reconnaissance shows Holmes that Oberstein's house backs onto an above-ground portion of the Underground line; furthermore, owing to traffic at a nearby junction, trains often stop right under his windows. It seems clear that West's body was laid on the train roof just there.

Holmes andDr. Watsonbreak into Oberstein's empty house and examine the windows, finding that the grime has been smudged, and there is a bloodstain. An Underground train stops right under the window. Some messages from theDaily Telegraphagony column, all seeming to allude to a business deal, are also found, posted by ""Pierrot"". Holmes posts a similarly cryptic message in theDaily Telegraphdemanding a meeting, signing it Pierrot, in the hopes that the thief might show up at Oberstein's house.

It works. Colonel Valentine Walter shows up and is stunned to find Holmes, Watson, Lestrade, and Mycroft all waiting for him. He confesses to the theft of the plans, but swears that it was Oberstein who killed West. West had followed the Colonel to Oberstein's and then intervened, and Oberstein had dealt West a fatal blow to the head. Oberstein then decided, over the Colonel's objections, that he had to keep three of the papers, because they could not be copied in a short time. He then got the idea of putting the other seven in West's pocket and putting him on a train roof outside his window, reasoning that he would be blamed for the theft when his body was found.

Deep in debt, Colonel Walter had acted out of a need for money. He redeems himself somewhat by agreeing to write to Oberstein, whose address on the Continent he knows, inviting him to come back to England for the fourth, vital page. This ruse also works; Oberstein is imprisoned, and the missing pages of the plans are recovered from his trunk. Colonel Walter dies in prison, not long after starting his sentence. For his efforts, Holmes is given an emerald tie pin by ""a certain gracious lady"", implied to beQueen Victoria, as the pin was received atWindsorin the 1890s.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70432,Clouds of witness,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouds_of_Witness,"Lord Peter Wimsey's brother, theDuke of Denver, has taken ashooting lodgeat Riddlesdale inYorkshire. At 3 o'clock one morning, Captain Denis Cathcart, the fiancé of Wimsey's sister Lady Mary, is found shot dead just outside the conservatory. Mary, trying to leave the house at 3 am for a reason she declines to explain, finds Denver kneeling over Cathcart's body. Suspicion falls on Denver, as the lethal bullet had come from his revolver and he admits having quarrelled with Cathcart earlier, after receiving a letter, which is lost, informing him that Cathcart had been caught cheating at cards. He maintains that he stumbled across the body after returning from a walk on the moors, but will say no more.

Wimsey arrives to investigate, along with his friend InspectorCharles Parker, who will find himself becoming increasingly attracted to Lady Mary throughout the novel. They find a series of unidentified footprints and a discarded jewel in the form of a cat. It is clear that both Denver and Mary are hiding something: Denver refuses to budge from his story that he was simply out for a walk, while Mary is feigning illness to avoid talking to anyone.

Wimsey investigates several false leads. The footprints turn out to be those of Mary's secret fiancé, Goyles, a socialist agitator considered ""an unsuitable match"" by her family. He had crept into the grounds for a pre-arranged rendezvous at 3 am, when the couple had intended to elope. Mary assumed that he was the killer and has been covering for him, but when she learns that he had fled in terror after discovering the body, she breaks off their engagement in disgust at his cowardice.

Wimsey's investigations lead him to a violent local farmer, Grimethorpe, with a stunningly beautiful wife. Wimsey finds the lost letter that was sent to Denver wedged in the window of the Grimethorpes' bedroom, proving that Denver had been visiting Mrs Grimethorpe on the night of Cathcart's death. This is what he has refused to admit, being determined to shield his mistress even at the price of being wrongfully convicted of murder.

Eventually, the jewelled cat leads Wimsey to Cathcart's mistress of many years, who had left him for an American millionaire. Wimsey travels to New York to find her, makes a daring and dangerous transatlantic flight back to London, and arrives just in time to present his evidence at Denver'strialin theHouse of Lords. Wimsey brings a letter that Cathcart had written to his mistress on the night of his death. After hearing that she was leaving him, Cathcart had written back stating his intention to commit suicide. He had then taken Denver's revolver from the study and gone out into the garden to shoot himself. The confounding factor in the investigation had been the coincidence of Denver returning from Mrs Grimethorpe's, just in time to find the body, at the same time that Mary had emerged from the house for her rendezvous with Goyles.

Denver is acquitted. As he is leaving the House of Lords, Grimethorpe appears, shoots at him, flees, and is knocked down and killed by a passing taxi. Mrs Grimethorpe, finally free of her husband, declares that she has no interest in continuing her affair with Denver. In the final scene of the book, Inspector Sugg finds Wimsey, Parker, and a friend on the street after midnight, hopelessly drunk, celebrating the end of the case. Sugg assists them intocabs, and reflects, ""Thank Gawd there weren't no witnesses.""

The book's title derives from theEpistle to the Hebrews, chapter 12, verse 1:[2]""Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.""[4]

In his 2017 overview of the classic crime genre,Martin Edwardssuggests thatClouds of Witnessis the work of a novelist learning her craft, but that it displays the storytelling qualities that soon made Sayers famous. While this early portrayal of Wimsey verges on a caricature, Sayers sought to characterise him in greater depth in later novels. Edwards notes that in this novel Wimsey is portrayed not only as a great detective but also as a man of action, and he quotes part of thedefence counsel'sspeech to theHouse of Lords, explaining Wimsey's transatlantic dash to attend the trial:[5]

Written in 1926, this imagined flight of a solo aviator, albeit with a passenger in this instance, preceded the actual accomplishment ofCharles Lindberghwho achieved the solo feat a year later.[7]Alcock and Brown, however, flying in tandem, had crossed the Atlantic non-stop in 1919.

A copy ofClouds of Witnesswas one of the volumes modified byJoe OrtonandKenneth Halliwellin their adulterations of library books from the Islington and Hampstead libraries in the early 1960s.[8]

In 1972 the novel was the subject of aBBC TV mini-series[9]starringIan Carmichaelas Wimsey andGlyn Houstonas Bunter.[10]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73295,Lord Peter views the body,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Peter_Views_the_Body,"Members ofLondon's ""Egotists' Club"" are telling stories of mysterious, unsolved happenings. One of the members' guests, a cinema actor named Varden, tells how he was invited to model for a wealthy sculptor, Eric Loder, and spent several months at Loder'sNew Yorkmansion.  Afterthe war, Loder invited Varden to return to New York for another sitting. Varden noticed that Loder's mistress, Maria Morano, had disappeared, though a life-size silver-plated sculpture of her now occupied the living room.  One night, Varden was wakened and told to flee for his life by a ""funny-looking""monocledman. This man then smashed the arm of the statue with a fireplace poker, showing Varden a human arm bone inside.  Varden fled the house immediately, but afterwards wondered if it was all a practical joke.

The ""funny-looking man"" – Wimsey, also a member of the club – appears and explains the mystery. Wimsey himself was a guest in Loder's mansion some weeks before Varden's arrival. A burst water bottle led him to abandon his bed for the living room sofa; there, he secretly witnessed Loder enter a hidden workshop behind a bookcase. After Loder left, Wimsey investigated and discovered anelectroplatingapparatus, as well as evidence that Loder had killed and electroplated Maria, and intended to do the same to Varden when he arrived. Loder had believed (incorrectly) that Varden and Maria were having an affair.

After frightening Varden away, Wimsey confronted Loder in the workshop. Loder tried to turn off the lights and attack Wimsey, but tripped and fell into the plating apparatus'cyanidetank, dying instantly. In trying to turn on the lights, Wimsey accidentally turned on the apparatus, causing Loder's hands to be electroplated in copper. Loder's death was ruled an accident, and Wimsey andBuntergave the statue of Maria aChristian burialwith the help of a sympathetic priest.

Peter and Bunter are queueing atGare Saint-LazareinParis, when Peter overhears a conversation from a young woman in the queue that makes him curious, particularly when he notes that the woman and her companion are travelling toDover.  After patient investigation, Peter meets with his mother's friend, the Dowager Countess ofMedway, warning her that someone is planning a burglary during her granddaughter's forthcoming wedding.  He believes he knows who the thief is, but has no proofs and must catch him red-handed.

Peter also alerts Charles Parker, who has men on guard during the wedding.  A brief uproar arises when the bride's famous diamond necklace, brought out of the family vault for the occasion, is reported stolen. The thieves are caught, however, and Peter shocks the assembled wedding party by exposing the Dowager Countess'sFrenchlady's maid as Monsieur Jacques le Rouge, alias ""Jacques Sans-culotte"", a notorioussafecracker,burglarand female impersonator.  Jacques cheerfully confesses, asking Peter how he knew.  Peter explains that, while queueing at Saint-Lazare, he overheard the ""female"" Jacques refer to himself by the masculinearticleuninstead of the feminineune. Jacques congratulates Peter for such a mastery of theFrench language, probably unique amongEnglish people. The Dowager Countess is initially outraged that Peter knowingly allowed her to be dressed, undressed, and assisted to bed by a man, but then laughs off the whole affair; she was a famous beauty in her youth, who attracted the attentions of many young men.

This is apparently the first Lord Peter story; it was originally published inPearson's Magazinevol. 60, July 1925, pp. 27–35.[2]

When old Meleager Finch dies, he leaves two wills: the first grants his fortune to the conservativePrimrose League, while the second leaves everything to his niece, Hannah, a young, serioussocialist. He writes a letter to Hannah explaining that this second will has been hidden somewhere, and that her only chance of finding it is ""by the exercise of a sustained frivolity.""

Lord Peter, his sister Mary, and his valet Bunter travel with Hannah to help her find the missing will. They discover that Meleager was acrossword puzzlefiend, and find a trove of puzzles he had written, including one with no accompanying grid. When Peter falls into theimpluvium, he discovers that the missing grid is the tiled floor of the fountain itself, and solving it reveals the location of the missing will.

The story is notable for containing an entire crossword puzzle in which all the clues are rhyming couplets (or quatrains): for example,

clues the wordENDIVE.

Two motorcyclists enter into a high speed chase on theGreat North Road, which carries on for many miles and passes many startled passers-by and motorists. They are blocked from tearing through a village by a brave policeman, who stands in their way. The second motorist (Mr Walters) explains that he was only chasing the first motorist (Mr Simpkins) because Simpkins dropped a bag further up the road. Simpkins vehemently denies owning the bag, much to Walters' astonishment as he actually saw the bag fall from Simpkin's bike. A passer-by discovers that the bag in question contains part of a corpse, and the two motorcyclists are detained just as Lord Peter arrives to claim the bag, which he claims was full of jewellery and was stolen from him.

Suspicious, the policeman takes all three in for questioning, and Wimsey insists that he be given no preferential treatment, as he too wants this matter looked into. Wimsey recognizes the face of the dead woman as that of a wealthy socialite who horribly mistreated her husband. The socialite, who recently disappeared, was said to have travelled to America, and her husband was supposed to sail to meet her in a few days' time. Further inquiries elicit that Simpkins, who runs a delivery service, was unwittingly hired by the jewel thief to pick up the bag of stolen jewels at a local baggage depot. He knew nothing of either crime, nor was he aware that he was given the wrong bag at the depot as both bags were identical. He also did not discover the gruesome contents until much later. Afraid he would be arrested, Simpkins then attempted to get rid of the bag, but Walters happened to see the moment the bag fell and kindly tried to return it, setting up the events of the story. Both motorcyclists make up their disagreement, deciding to someday have a more legal race.

Wimsey recovers his own bag of jewels from the depot, and lays a trap for the socialite's husband on the steamer bound for America. The murderer is quickly arrested, and his final fate is left unknown.

Wimsey is surprised when Mrs. Ruyslander, the wife of a diamond merchant, knocks on his hotel room door in the middle of the night. She asks for his help in recovering some stolen jewels, and a photograph with an indiscreet inscription, from a blackmailer before her husband returns from a trip toSouth Africa. Wimsey finds Paul Melville, the blackmailer, at one of his clubs; throughsleight of hand, Wimsey convinces the other members of the club that Melville has been hiding cards up his sleeve duringpokergames. Wimsey agrees to confront the now-vehemently-protesting Melville alone. After some arguing, Melville, much to his annoyance, is forced to return the diamonds and photograph to clear his name. After regaining Mrs. Ruyslander's property, Wimsey then returns to the other members of the club and exonerates Melville by demonstrating how the simple conjuring trick was done, assuring the onlookers that there are some crimes the law does not need to touch.

Lord Peter is visiting a friend, Mr. Frobisher-Pym, in a small village inEssex. Mr. Burdock, a local member of thelanded gentry, has recently died, leaving two sons: Martin, who married discreditably beneath his class and moved abroad, and Haviland, a businessman in London.

Peter is introduced to a villager who reports having seen a ghostlycoach, drawn by four headless horses, galloping soundlessly in the middle of the night, which he takes as an omen of death. Peter goes to investigate, finding no clues, but meets theHigh Churchvicar and learns of an unusual plan for various village inhabitants to keep an overnight vigil, two at a time, for the deceased Mr. Burdock.

Peter then borrows a horse and rides to a neighboring village to catch up with an oldwarcomrade. On his way back, late at night and inebriated, he encounters the same ghostly coach, and notes where it goes. In the morning, he learns that the church has been vandalized and the two vigil-keepers locked in the cellar, apparently the work ofNonconformists. Regardless, Mr. Burdock's coffin is buried.

Investigating where the ghostly coach might have gone, Peter finds a barn containing a number of suspicious items that might have been used to make a carriage appear spectral. He visits the decaying manor house of the late Mr. Burdock, and discovers, behind a water-damaged copy of theNuremberg Chronicle, the last will of the deceased gentleman. It contains a bizarre stipulation: as long as his body remains above ground, Martin inherits his wealth; but as soon as it is buried, it reverts to Haviland.

Since the body was apparently already buried, Haviland appears to have won, but it soon transpires that the coffin was empty, with the body having been removed by friends of Martin, who arranged the ghostly coach and vandalism of the church to distract from their theft of the corpse. But Haviland is not innocent either; the matching water stains on the Chronicle and the adjacent wall prove that the will had been only recently placed there. Martin, who was not aware of his friends' handiwork until after the fact, declares he will have his father entombed above the ground, and split the fortune with his brother. Lord Peter concludes that the whole affair ""throws a sad light on human nature"" and departs for London.

While assisting a doctor friend with his experiments in curing diseases in rats, Wimsey and Bunter hear the sound of footsteps and shouting from the flat above. A moment later, the tenant comes running downstairs to get the doctor, hysterically proclaiming his wife Maddalena has been killed by aMafiosowho broke in through their kitchen window.

While the police are sent for, Wimsey searches the flat for clues, his subconscious telling him that something is strange about the whole story. The woman has been stabbed to the heart but with a strange, jagged weapon that has now been removed. There are no footprints on the sill or glass roof of the doctor's laboratory below, as the window-cleaner had recently been. Furthermore, though the chicken is burning in the oven, the bowl of dripping, which is full, has been already removed and set on the counter, suggesting the chicken was taken out and then hurriedly put back in again. Quickly, Wimsey realizes what was subconsciously bothering him – the sound of footsteps running came from the wrong direction, running to and fro in the kitchen instead of to the body and then to the stair as the tenant suggests. Pulling the skewer out from the chicken, Wimsey and the doctor discover traces of human blood on it, which the man was trying to burn off in the oven. His motive for the crime was unreasonable jealousy, as his pretty Italian wife attracted several admirers each time they went out.

A man going by the name of Death Bredon, claiming to be a journalist, heads to an oldchateauin France, which contains a laboratory where an aging Count is inventing a formula that may be used inchemical warfare. It has been well-publicized that Lord Peter Wimsey himself has been sent to buy this formula for the British government. However, Bredon, in his supposed pursuit of Wimsey and the story, has been waylaid several times on the journey and nearly misses the train after being locked in a public lavatory.

Finally arriving at thechateau, Bredon sends in a letter purporting to be from Wimsey, saying he is Wimsey's cousin and has been sent ahead by him to visit the Count. Being shown in, he is confronted by two men claiming to be Lord Peter Wimsey, and both deny he is their cousin. When the Count suggests Bredon could identify which Wimsey is the impostor, Bredon tells the Count that he only communicates with his cousin in writing and has never seen him face to face.

After many hours of frustration, the Count decides the only way to solve the mystery is a wine-tasting test. Wimsey is famously known to be able to identify nearly all wines in existence by taste, even when blindfolded. Bredon is allowed to taste all the wines and venture an opinion so he will not feel left out, and he quickly leaves both ""Wimseys"" in the dust, proving his real identity. By this time, one false Wimsey is too inebriated to care, but the other attempts to take the formula by force. After the impostor is subdued by ""Bredon"", the real Wimsey, the Count declares that seeing the two Englishmen betraying their country to buy the formula for some foreign power has caused him to decide not to sell the formula to another country, even an ally, for fear he himself might someday be labelled a traitor. Wimsey wholeheartedly agrees with this decision, as he had disliked the idea of ""trafficking in destruction"" anyway.

At Mr Ffoliot's used bookstore, Lord Peter Wimsey and his 10-year-old nephew Viscount St George, alias ""Gherkins"", discover an old copy ofMünster’sCosmographia Universalis, which is in bad condition and missing several pages. Despite this, Gherkins buys it, wanting to start collecting old and rare books like his uncle. The book is one of several that Dr Conyers, acancerspecialist, sold to fund his research.

Wimsey and Gherkins (who is staying with his uncle) return home, and are soon visited by a man named Wilberforce Pope, who insists upon buying theCosmographiafrom them. He cites sentimental reasons, saying he is Dr Conyers' relative and used to read the book as a boy. However, he shows little real knowledge as to the book's contents. Gherkins refuses to sell, and is backed up by Peter, who is suspicious of Pope's motives. Three nights later, the burglar alarm trips, and Wimsey and Bunter stop two criminals from stealing theCosmographia. The two men confess they were hired by a mysterious gentleman, and told the theft of the book was merely a harmless prank. They describe Wilberforce Pope's appearance when asked what their employer looked like.

Peter and Gherkins examine the book, and go to stay with Dr Conyers. The doctor explains he wishes to build a hospital and a clinic to continue his research. He lately has been seeking ""the treasure hidden in Munster"", which retired pirate ""Old Cut-Throat"" Conyers bequeathed to his descendants many generations before. However, the doctor's capital has been severely depleted in searching bothMunster, IrelandandMünster, Germany, with no success. Wimsey suggests that the Munster in question is really the author of theCosmographia; opening the book in question, he shows Conyers an inscription someone has written around a dragon decoration in a map of theCanary Islands. It suggests the treasure may be in the Canaries, so Wimsey and Conyers decide to fund an expedition there. However, in the middle of the night, Wimsey looks out of the window and discovers that the man-made pond Old Cut-Throat built in the grounds has false islands and a dragon fountain corresponding exactly to the old map. He and Gherkins sneak out, take adinghyfrom the boathouse, and explore the dragon fountain, finding the treasure chest inside. Mr Pope arrives on the scene minutes too late, in search of the treasure himself (to which he has no claim), and is arrested by policemen waiting in the shadows on Wimsey's orders. Gherkins and Wimsey give Dr Conyers his treasure, congratulating him on the hospital that is soon to be.

Thomas MacPherson, a final year medical student in Scotland, shows Wimsey the very strange legacy his Great-Uncle Joseph Ferguson left him. Great-Uncle Joseph, who died at the age of 95 by throwing himself out of a sixth-floor window, bequeathed his grand-nephew only his stomach and alimentary organs, with their contents, preserved in a bottle. Wimsey suspects there is more to the story than an eccentric old man's whims, especially when he learns that Great-Uncle Joseph was said to be very rich but withdrew more than £84,000 (nearly £5.5 million today) from the bank in the years leading up to his death. The only other heir, one Robert Ferguson, is a greedy wastrel, and was upset to receive only a pittance.

Wimsey goes toSomerset House(where the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths was then located) and asks to see Great-Uncle Joseph's will. He finds that the old man was careful to specify that his entire alimentary canal be ligatured top and bottom, and that Ferguson was to study it, not keep it on the shelf. Wimsey encounters Robert there, and pretends to be writing a book on odd wills, hoping that will allay Robert's suspicions. He makes further inquiries and discovers from a friend in the jewellery business that Great-Uncle Joseph bought 12 large matching diamonds from assorted dealers, paying in cash for all of them. Wimsey immediately sends MacPherson a telegram advising him to open up the specimen, then washes his hands of the matter and attends a rare book auction.

However, the next day, Wimsey gets a telegram informing him that a burglar stole Great-Uncle Joseph's bottle from MacPherson's house. The burglar dropped the bottle in his flight, and the shards were found, but not the specimen. Wimsey heads back to Scotland, where he finds that MacPherson didn't see his first telegram, being out fishing at the time. Robert was also discovered fishing in the river that morning, but tried to flee when spotted by MacPherson and slipped and broke his kneecap, and is now staying in the house awaiting the arrival of a qualified doctor. Wimsey and MacPherson drive along the river until they find the specimen washed up on a bank and being eaten by seagulls. They bring it home, and dissect it. Eleven of the diamonds are still within, the twelfth having been presumably eaten by a gull. Wimsey then explains that he and Robert had both come to the conclusion that the old man had swallowed the diamonds shortly before committing suicide. MacPherson is more than happy with his eleven diamonds, though his manservant Jock insists upon shooting the gulls to find the twelfth.

Several passengers on a train are excitedly discussing a recent murder, in which a man was found on a beach, strangled, with his face cut off. Lord Peter Wimsey is among them, and cleverly deduces several facts about the case based on details mentioned by the passengers. A policeman, Inspector Winterbottom,  overhears the conversation and takes Lord Peter's calling card.

Shortly afterwards, newspapers announce that police have identified  the faceless victim as the studio manager of anadvertising agency. The policeman from the train visits Wimsey and professes his theory that the murder was committed by an Italian over a love affair.

Peter meets with an old journalist friend and learns that the murder victim had had his portrait recently painted by one of his employees at the advertising agency. He goes to investigate, and finds that the portrait is a striking piece of art but an unflattering likeness, and purchases it from the artist. He interviews a woman working at the agency and learns that the victim was loathed by his employees, and that he commissioned the portrait but refused to buy it.

Meeting with Inspector Winterbottom again, Wimsey recounts his final theory of the murder, in which the frustrated artist opportunistically kills his manager and destroys the face he grew to hate while painting his portrait. Winterbottom congratulates him on his theory but reveals that the Italian suspect was found dead by suicide with an apparent confession, and that the case is closed.

Afterwards, Peter muses to himself that he could have proved that the artist was indeed the murderer, ""but the man had a villainous face, and there are few good painters in the world.""

Shortly after the newspapers announce that Lord Peter Wimsey is suspected of having been killed while huntingbig gamein Africa, Rogers, a disgruntled footman who had been dismissed from his post, joins a mysterious and highly effective secret society of criminals. This society is unusual in that all members are required to wear black executioner's hoods with white numbers embroidered on them so no one knows anyone else's identity, whenever the gang meets together. To openly name another member means instant death. Rogers, now ""Number 21"", is told his principal duty is to give information about houses he has served in, and for two years is a useful and respected member of the society. After this time, however, things suddenly start to go wrong for the society – robbery attempts end in narrow escapes from being arrested instead of in lucrative hauls, stolen pearls turn out to be imitation, and so forth. Lord Peter Wimsey's mother loses a diamond tiara to the gang during this time.

Finally, the entire gang of 50 is called to a dance, but only 48 arrive. The gigantic and brutal man who is Number One informs them he has had two members secretly executed, as they have been arrested and he was afraid they would talk. He then exposes ""Number 21"" as the mole who has been ruining their plans. Rogers admits that the real footman Rogers was the one killed in the big game hunting accident, and that he is really Lord Peter Wimsey, who stole Rogers' identity for the purpose of infiltrating the gang and helping Scotland Yard finally bring them to justice. He offers, in exchange for a quick death and the sparing of Bunter, his mother, and his sister (whom he falsely claims know nothing of the matter), the combination to a secret room in the back of his safe, in which he has a book containing the identities and professions of all 50 members of the society.

Horrified, Number One (the only other person who knows everyone's identity) interrogates Wimsey in private and learns Wimsey is not bluffing. Returning to the gang and berating them for gross carelessness, he orders two men to go to retrieve Wimsey's book of evidence from the safe. The gang rises up against their leader, afraid the two men will be traitors as well. Number One is forced to go himself, leaving his mistress Number Two in charge. When he does not return, Wimsey admits to an enraged Number Two and the rest of the society that he had a second secret door in the hidden chamber, which, when the book was lifted, would slam shut and seal Number One in. The gang sets a time fuse to blow up their meeting house, despite Number Two's protests, and lock Wimsey inside before fleeing. They encounter hidden police officers, who had come when an electric alarm in Wimsey's safe alerted them. Wimsey informs Number Two that the secret door isvoice-activatedand only he can open it – she frees him, and the two escape just as the house goes up in flames. Chief Inspector Parker and Inspector Sugg are delighted to see Wimsey again, and they return to Wimsey's flat to let Number One out of the safe before he suffocates. Wimsey opens the voice-activated door with his code word, which turns out to be ""Open Sesame"",Ali Baba's password in theArabian Nights."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2347,The Adventure of the Dying Detective,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dying_Detective,"Dr. Watson is called to tend Holmes, who is apparently dying of a rare tropical disease, Tapanuli fever, contracted while he was on a case. Watson is shocked, not having heard about his friend's illness. Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days.

Holmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. In fact, he scorns to be treated by Watson and insults his abilities, astonishing and hurting the doctor.  Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or call in a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. While Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes's room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches a small ivory box, ordering Watson to put it down and sit still.

At six o'clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half-full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives.

Watson goes to Smith's address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith's attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith's arrival.

Believing that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It emerges, to the hiding Watson's horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith's nephew Victor Savage. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die.

Holmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies - no longer in the voice of a man near death - ""a match and a cigarette."" Inspector Morton then enters, as the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith points out that his word is as good as Holmes' in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation.

Holmes explains his illness was feigned as a ruse to induce Smith to confess to his nephew's murder. Holmes was not infected by the little box; he has enough enemies to know that he must always examine his mail carefully before he opens it. Starving himself for three days and the claim of the ""disease's"" infectious nature was to keep Watson from examining him and discovering the ruse, since, as he clarifies, he has every respect for his friend's medical skills.

In the story, the killer Culverton Smith's motive for killing his nephew, Victor Savage, is mentioned in an offhand remark by Holmes that Savage stood between ""this monster [Smith] and areversion.""The New Annotated Sherlock Holmeshas a note for this word:

The setting date may be inferred from Watson's mention of it being ""the second year of my marriage"", the first having been 1889. Inspector Morton is referred to in a familiar fashion but this is his only appearance incanon. Canonical scholarLeslie S. Klingerwondered if Morton was the companion to Inspector Brown inThe Sign of the Four.[3]

Tropical disease specialist William A. Sodeman Jr., proposed that ""Tapanuli fever"" wasmelioidosis,[4]a conclusion supported by physician Setu K. Vora.[5]Vora raised the possibility that Conan Doyle read the first report of melioidosis published in 1912 before writing his short story in 1913.

""The Adventure of the Dying Detective"" was published in the US inCollier'son 22 November 1913, and in the UK inThe Strand Magazinein December 1913.[1]The story was published with three illustrations byFrederic Dorr SteeleinCollier's, and with four illustrations byWalter Paget(Sidney Paget's brother) in theStrand.[6]The story was included in the short story collectionHis Last Bow,[6]which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.[7]

It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children's book seriesThe Great Detective Sherlock Holmes, as ""The Dying Detective"" (瀕死的大偵探). It is Book #19 of the original Chinese version,[26]and book #14 of the English version.[27]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9552,The Hound of the Baskervilles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles,"InLondon, 1889, Dr. James Mortimer asks for the aid of Sherlock Holmes, beginning by reading him a legend that has run in the Baskerville family since the time of theEnglish Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville kidnapped a farmer's daughter. When the girl escaped, Hugo pursued her, swearing a curse upon himself in his mad rage. Hugo's companions later found the girl dead of fear, and Hugo killed by ademonic hound. The dog is said to have hauntedDartmoorever since, causing the premature death of many Baskervilles.

Mortimer explains that his friend, thephilanthropicbaronetSir Charles Baskerville, took the legend very seriously. Sir Charles, who had a weak heart, had retired to Baskerville Hall in 1887, after amassing a fortune inSouth Africa. When the baronet's body was later found in ayewalley, with an expression of horror on his face, the death was attributed tocardiac arrest; however, Mortimer had secretly noticed large canine paw prints near the body. Sir Charles had been the eldest of three Baskerville brothers, and Sir Henry, theCanadianson of the deceased second brother, is Sir Charles' heir. The rather immoral third brother, Rodger, died ofyellow feverinSouth Americain 1876. Mortimer, theexecutorof Sir Charles'swill, fears it might not be wise to bring Sir Henry to Dartmoor, in view of the possible supernatural dangers.

Though Holmes dismisses the legend as afairy-tale, he meets with Sir Henry when the new baronet arrives in London. It transpires that strange things are already happening to Sir Henry; one of his old boots has been stolen, he has received an anonymous letter warning him against the moor, and someone has been following him in ahansom. Mortimer reveals that Sir Henry's inheritance is about£740,000 (equivalent to £103,000,000 in 2023[6]); in view of these high stakes, Holmes asks Watson to act as Sir Henry's bodyguard, and to investigate things in Dartmoor.

Upon arriving in Dartmoor, Watson, Mortimer and Sir Henry learn that Selden, a convicted murderer, has escaped fromPrincetown Prisonand is loose on the moor. At Baskerville Hall, they are introduced to John and Eliza Barrymore, the married butler and housekeeper. Watson sends detailed accounts of his investigations to Holmes, particularly focusing on the neighbourhood residents. The Stapleton siblings stand out; Jack is over-friendly, drops hints about the hound, and warns Watson against attempting to cross the dangerous GrimpenMire. His sister Beryl, without his knowledge, repeatedly tries to get Sir Henry to flee back to London. Another neighbour, Mr. Frankland, is a perpetual busybody and troublemaker, including threatening to bring a lawsuit against Dr. Mortimer for excavatingnearby barrows. Sir Henry falls in love with Beryl Stapleton, though her brother strongly objects to the romance.

Barrymore repeatedly sends candlelight signals to someone on the moor. Following Barrymore one night, Watson and Sir Henry discover that Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's younger brother, and that she and her husband have been leaving food out for him. During an unsuccessful attempt to catch Selden, Watson sees a strange man standing on ator.

Watson and Sir Henry learn from Barrymore that Frankland's estranged daughter Laura had once written to Sir Charles. After a failed attempt to interrogate Laura, Watson investigates the man on the tor and learns that it is Holmes, who has been investigating in secret to hide his direct involvement. Holmes reveals that Jack Stapleton is the murderer, and Beryl is his wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister; however, Holmes does not have enough proof to convince the authorities.

Holmes and Watson hear a man fleeing from a baying hound, and later find that Selden has fallen from a cliff and died. Barrymore had given Selden Sir Henry's discarded clothes, and Stapleton's hound, having been set on the trail with Sir Henry's stolen boot, had confused the scent. Later, after dining at Baskerville Hall, Holmes reveals to Watson that the portrait of Sir Hugo Baskerville bears a remarkable resemblance to Stapleton.

Holmes decides to use an unwitting Sir Henry as bait; he orders him to visit Stapleton that evening, and then walk across the moor on foot. Holmes and Watson then pretend to leave for London, but instead hide near Stapleton's house withInspector LestradeofScotland Yard. Despite thick fog, they manage to kill the hound when Stapleton unleashes it after Sir Henry. They go to Stapleton's house to arrest him, but find he has bound his wife to a column and fled into the mire, presumably drowning. Holmes remarks that he considers Stapleton one of his most cunning adversaries.

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer depart on a sea voyage, to repair the baronet's shattered nerves. After they leave, Holmes explains to Watson that Jack Stapleton was really Rodger Baskerville II, the secret son of Sir Charles' youngest brother. A physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, Rodger II had bought a savage black hound and painted it withphosphorusto make it look diabolical; either by fright or direct attack, he hoped the dog would remove all the other heirs so that he could inherit the Baskerville fortune. He had promised Laura marriage, and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house on the night of the murder. Unable to save Sir Charles, Beryl had sent the anonymous letter to Sir Henry to thwart her husband's further schemes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home,UndershawinSurrey, fromSouth Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital inBloemfonteinduring theSecond Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story ""The Final Problem"". AlthoughThe Hound of the Baskervillesis set before the latter events, two years later Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" that Holmes had faked his own death. As a result, the character of Holmes occupies aliminal spacebetween being alive and dead, which further adds to the gothic elements of the novel.[7]

He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by aDaily Expressjournalist namedBertram Fletcher Robinson(1870–1907), with whom he explored Dartmoor in June 1901; Robinson received a1⁄3royalty paymentthat amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.[8]

Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story (written and published in 1898) of a terrifying giant wolf, ""The King of the Foxes"".

The author’s ideas came from the legend of SquireRichard Cabellof Brook Hall, in the parish ofBuckfastleigh, Devon,[9]which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town ofBuckfastleigh.[10][11][12]

Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a ""monstrously evil man"". He gained this reputation, among other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to theDevil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter ofSir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet(1593–1674), ofFowelscombe.[13]On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.[14]

Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as theYeth houndthat Doyle may have heard.[15]

Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:[16]Fowelscombe in the parish ofUgborough, the seat of theFowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) andBrook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.[9]It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.[17]

Still other tales claim that Doyle was inspired by a holiday inNorth Norfolk, where the tale ofBlack Shuckis well known. The Gothic-revival styleCromer Hall, where Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.[18]Another suggestion is thatArchibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose home was Dalmeny House, toldArthur Conan Doylethat a hound barked mournfully during the night of the death of his wifeHannah, in accordance with a Dalmeny legend that hearing a hound portended a dynastic tragedy.[19]

James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of ""Love's Old Sweet Song"", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville ofCrowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.[20]

The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. The structure of the novel starting and ending in the familiar setting in London is used to ‘delimit the uncanny world associated with the Gothic landscape of the moors', with varying degrees of success.[7]Doyle wrote[citation needed]that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' in the style ofLe Fanu, with the idea of introducing Holmes as thedeus ex machinaarising only later.

The Hound of the Baskervilleswas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinein 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end incliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 byGeorge Newnes Ltd.[21]It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips & Co.[22]

In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individualleavesas part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher – they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185–190 leaves, only 37 are known to still exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by theNew York Public Library.[Note 1]Other leaves are owned by university libraries in the United States and by private collectors. Four of the known survivors are in unknown locations, including one that was stolen.[22]

A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.[24]Another one was sold in 2021 for $423,000.[25]The existence of the 37th leaf became publicly known in 2018; it was put up for auction in 2022, but did not sell.[26]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9557,The Valley of Fear,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Fear,"Sherlock Holmesreceives aciphermessage from Fred Porlock, a pseudonymous agent ofProfessor Moriarty. Holmes deciphers the message as a warning of a nefarious plot against a man surnamed Douglas, a country gentleman residing at Birlstone House. Some minutes later, Inspector MacDonald arrives at221B Baker Streetwith news that Douglas was murdered the night before. MacDonald, Holmes, and Watson travel to Birlstone House to investigate.

Birlstone House is surrounded by a shallow moat, which the murderer appears to have crossed as they fled the crime scene. After interviewing Cecil Barker, a frequent guest at Birlstone House who discovered the body, they agree that suicide is out of the question and that someone from outside the house committed the murder. Barker explains that Douglas married after arriving in England five years earlier. Barker believes asecret societyof men pursued Douglas, and that he retreated to rural England out of fear for his life. Mrs. Douglas said her husband mentioned something called ""The Valley of Fear"". Holmes learns that the housekeeper heard a sound, as if of a door slamming, half an hour before the alarm; Holmes believes that this sound was the fatal shot.

Local detective White Mason and Inspector MacDonald track a bicycle found on the grounds of the house to an American staying at a guest house. The American appears to be the murderer, but there is no sign of him. Holmes asks MacDonald to write to Barker, telling him that the police intend to search the moat the next day. That night, they lie in wait outside Birlstone Manor and see Barker fish the clothes of the missing American out of the moat. Barker refuses to explain the situation. At that moment, Douglas appears, alive and well. He hands Watson a written account called ""The Valley of Fear"", which explains why he feared for his life.

Douglas explains that he had spotted an enemy of his, Ted Baldwin, in the area and expected an attack. When Baldwin attempted to shoot Douglas in his study, Douglas grabbed onto Baldwin's shotgun; in the struggle, Baldwin was shot in the face. With Barker's help, Douglas dressed the man in his clothes to confuse his enemies. He then hid himself in the oldpriest holeat Birlstone.

The main narrative pauses to explain Douglas' past in America. Douglas' real name was Birdy Edwards and he had been aPinkerton detectiveinChicago. Working undercover for the Pinkertons, Edwards had travelled to Vermissa Valley (the titular Valley of Fear) under the alias John ""Jack"" McMurdo to infiltrate a corrupt coal minerstrade union, secretly a cover for a murderous gang known as the Scowrers. After Edwards brought the gang to justice, the surviving criminals attempted to kill him. Edwards changed his name to Douglas and fled to England.

Holmes urges Douglas to leave England. Douglas takes this advice, but, shortly after, Holmes learns from Barker that Douglas was lost overboard on the ship to Africa. Holmes believes Moriarty was responsible for ending Douglas' life and he swears to bring Moriarty down.

The Valley of Fearwas first serialised inThe Strand Magazinefrom September 1914 to May 1915.[3]In theStrand, it was published with thirty-one illustrations by Frank Wiles. In the United States, the novel was serialized from September to November 1914 in Associated Sunday Magazine supplements to various newspapers around the country.

The Valley of Fearwas first published in book form byGeorge H. Doran Companyin New York on 27 February 1915, after the serialisation was completed in the United States but before it had finished in theStrand. The first British book edition was published bySmith, Elder & Co.on 3 June 1915. Like the first Holmes novelA Study in Scarlet,The Valley of Fearhas two parts. The first part is titled ""The Tragedy of Birlstone"", and the second is titled ""The Scowrers"".[4]The novel concludes with a short epilogue.

Doyle craftedThe Valley of Fearas ""two parts and a coda"". The novel has a number of major themes, including ""problems of ethical ambiguity"", and attempts to comment seriously on terrorist activity as profiled by American union struggles. Critics have shown how the American union struggles deal with similar issues in the contemporary political situation in Ireland.[5]

Several films have adapted the book, among them:

The Valley of Fearwas the only Sherlock Holmes story not adapted for the 1930s radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and was not adapted for radio until 1960.[8]Radio adaptations of the story include:"
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1718,Manalive,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manalive,"This is a book in two parts. The first, ""The Enigma of Innocent Smith"", concerns the arrival of a new tenant at Beacon House, a London boarding establishment. LikeMary Poppins, this man (who is tentatively identified by lodger Arthur Inglewood as an ex-schoolmate named Innocent Smith) is accompanied by a great wind, and he breathes new life into the household with his games and antics. During his first day in residence the eccentric Smith creates the High Court of Beacon; arranges to elope with Mary Gray, paid companion to heiress Rosamund Hunt; inspires Inglewood to declare his love for Diana Duke, the landlady's niece; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist Michael Moon and Rosamund.

However, when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news: Smith is wanted on charges of burglary, desertion of a spouse,polygamy, and attempted murder. The fact that Smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at Inglewood's friend Dr. Herbert Warner seems to confirm the worst. Before Smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum, Michael Moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the High Court of Beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press.

The second part, ""The Explanations of Innocent Smith,"" follows the trial. The prosecution consists of Moses Gould, a merrily cynical Jew who lives at Beacon House and considers Smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel, and Dr. Cyrus Pym, an American criminal specialist called in by Dr. Warner; Michael Moon and Arthur Inglewood act for the defense. The evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against Smith. In every case, the defendant is revealed to be, as his first name states, innocent. He fires bullets near people to make them value life; the house he breaks into is his own; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife Mary, posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re-enact their courtship.

Smith is, needless to say, acquitted on all charges.

The book was first adapted in French, as a Belgian film titledLe revolver aux cheveux rouges(1973).

Dale Ahlquist, president of theAmerican Chesterton Society, with screenwriter, producer and director Joey Odendahl, produced the American motion pictureManalive(2012), starringMark P. Sheaas Innocent Smith and Kevin O'Brian as Professor Eames.[1]A private screening of the movie was shown at the American Chesterton Society's 31st Annual Chesterton Conference inReno, NV, on 3 August 2012.[1][2]"
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9705,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood,"The novel begins as John Jasper leaves a Londonopium den.[5]He is the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. The next evening, he is visited by his nephew, Edwin Drood. Edwin confides that he has misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud, which had been arranged by their fathers. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits. Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else.

Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena are sent to Cloisterham for their education. Neville will study with theminor canonthe Rev. Septimus Crisparkle; Helena will live at the Nuns' House with Rosa. Neville confides to Mr Crisparkle that he had hated his cruel stepfather, while Rosa confides to Helena that she loathes and fears Jasper, who is her music master. Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa and is indignant that Edwin treats his betrothal so lightly. Edwin provokes him and he reacts violently, which gives Jasper the opportunity to spread rumours that Neville has a violent temper. Mr Crisparkle tries to reconcile Edwin and Neville; Neville agrees to apologise to Edwin if Edwin will forgive him. It is arranged that they will dine together for this purpose on Christmas Eve at Jasper's home.

Rosa's guardian, Mr Grewgious, tells her that she has a substantial inheritance from her father. When she asks whether there would be any forfeiture if she did not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be none on either side. Back at his office in London, Mr Grewgious gives Edwin a ring which Rosa's father had given to her mother, with the proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his irrevocable commitment to her or return it to Mr Grewgious. Mr Bazzard, Mr Grewgious's clerk, witnesses this transaction.

Next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal.  They decide to ask Mr Grewgious to break the news to Jasper, and Edwin intends to return the ring to Mr Grewgious. Meanwhile, Durdles takes Jasper into the cathedralcrypt. On the way there Durdles points out a mound ofquicklime. Jasper provides Durdles with a bottle of wine. The wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles loses consciousness; while unconscious he dreams that Jasper goes off by himself in the crypt. As Jasper and Durdles return from the crypt, they encounter a boy called Deputy; Jasper, thinking he was spying on them, takes him by the throat but, realising that this will strangle him, lets him go.

On Christmas Eve, Neville buys himself a heavy walking stick; he plans to spend his Christmas break hiking in the countryside. Meanwhile, Edwin visits a jeweller to get his pocket watch repaired; it is mentioned that the only jewellery he wears is the watch and chain and a shirt pin. By chance he meets a woman who is an opium user from London. She asks Drood's Christian name and he replies that it is ""Edwin""; she says he is fortunate it is not ""Ned"", for ""Ned"" is in great danger. He thinks nothing of this, for the only person who calls him ""Ned"" is Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper buys himself a black scarf of strong silk, which is not seen again during the course of the novel. The reconciliation dinner is successful and at midnight Edwin Drood and Neville Landless leave together to go down to the river and look at a storm that rages that night.

The next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper encourages suspicions that Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for his hike; the townspeople overtake him and forcibly bring him back to the city. Mr Crisparkle keeps Neville out of jail by taking responsibility for him, stating that he will produce Neville any time his presence is required. That night, Jasper is strongly affected when Mr Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa have ended their betrothal; he reacts more strongly to this news than to the possibility that Edwin may be dead. The next morning, Mr Crisparkle goes to the riverweirand finds Edwin's watch and chain and shirt pin.

Half a year later, Neville is living in London near Mr Grewgious's office. Lieutenant Tartar introduces himself and offers to share his garden with Neville; Lt Tartar's chambers are adjacent to Neville's above a common courtyard.

A white-haired and whiskered stranger calling himself Dick Datchery arrives in Cloisterham. He rents a room below Jasper's and observes the comings and goings in the area. Going to his lodgings for the first time, Mr Datchery asks Deputy for directions. Deputy will not go near the lodgings for fear that Jasper will choke him again.

Jasper visits Rosa at the Nuns' House and professes his love for her. She rejects him but he persists, telling her that if she gives him no hope he will destroy Neville, the brother of her dear friend Helena. In fear of Jasper, Rosa flees to Mr Grewgious in London.

The next day Mr Crisparkle follows Rosa to London. While he is with her and Mr Grewgious, Lt Tartar calls and asks if he remembers him. Mr Crisparkle does remember him, as the person who years before saved him from drowning. They do not dare let Rosa contact Neville and Helena directly, for fear that Jasper may be watching Neville, but Lt Tartar allows Rosa to visit his chambers to contact Helena above the courtyard. Mr Grewgious arranges for Rosa to rent a place from Mrs Billickin and for Miss Twinkleton to live with her there for respectability.

Jasper visits the London opium den again for the first time since Edwin's disappearance. When he leaves, at dawn, the woman who runs the opium den follows him. She vows to herself that she will not lose his trail again, as she had done after his last visit. This time, she follows him all the way to his home in Cloisterham; outside it she meets Datchery, who tells her Jasper's name and that he will sing in the cathedral service the next morning. On inquiry, Datchery learns she is called ""Princess Puffer"". The next morning she attends the service and shakes her fists at Jasper from behind a pillar, observed by both Datchery and Deputy.

Dickens's death leaves the rest of the story unknown.  According to his friend and biographerJohn Forster, after writing him two brief letters which relate to the plot (but not the murder) Dickens had supplied Forster with an outline of the full plot:

Edwin Drood's fate is not clear. His killer, if any, is not revealed but is generally believed to be John Jasper, his uncle, for three reasons:

The book gives other hints:

Datchery appears some time after Edwin's disappearance and keeps a close eye on Jasper. There are hints that he is in disguise, and this possibility has been taken up in adaptations of the story which try to solve the mystery:

The Mystery of Edwin Droodwas scheduled to be published in twelve instalments (fewer than Dickens's usual twenty) from April 1870 to February 1871, each costing oneshillingand illustrated byLuke Fildes. Only six of the instalments were completed before Dickens's death in 1870. It was therefore approximately half-finished.

Planned instalments never published:

Supplying a conclusion toThe Mystery of Edwin Droodhas occupied writers from Dickens's death to the present day.

The first three attempts to complete the story were undertaken by Americans. The first, byRobert Henry Newell, published under the pen name Orpheus C. Kerr in 1870,[10]was as much a parody as a continuation, transplanting the story to the United States. It is a ""burlesque"" farce rather than a serious attempt to continue in the spirit of the original story.

The second ending was written by Henry Morford, a New York journalist. He travelled to Rochester with his wife and published the ending serially during his stay in England from 1871 to 1872. In this ending, Edwin Drood survives Jasper's murder attempt. Datchery is Bazzard in disguise, but Helena disguises herself as well to overhear Jasper's mumbling under the influence of opium. It was titledJohn Jasper's Secret: Sequel to Charles Dickens' Mystery of Edwin Drood. Newspaper articles from 1870 confirmed that the story would be completed and authored byCharles Dickens, JrandWilkie Collins, despite Collins's disavowal. The illustrative green cover for the book was designed by Charles Allston Collins,[11]who was Charles Dickens's son-in-law and Wilkie Collins's brother.[12][13]

The third attempt was perhaps the most unusual. In 1873, aBrattleboro, Vermont, printer,Thomas Power James, published a version which he claimed had been literally 'ghost-written' by him channelling Dickens's spirit.[14][15][16]A sensation was created:  several critics praised this version, includingArthur Conan Doyle, himself a spiritualist, who said it was similar in style to Dickens's work; and for several decades the James version ofEdwin Droodwas common in America. OtherDroodscholars disagree. John C. Walters dismissed it with contempt, stating that the work ""is self-condemned by its futility, illiteracy, and hideous American mannerisms; the mystery itself becomes a nightmare, and the solution only deepens the obscurity.""[17]

Four of the most recent of the posthumous collaborations areThe Mystery of Edwin DroodbyLeon Garfield(1980),The Decoding of Edwin Drood(1980) by Charles Forsyte,The Disappearance of Edwin Drood, a Holmesian pastiche by Peter Rowland (1992), andThe Mystery of Edwin Droodby David Madden (2011).[18]The D Case(1989) offered a humorous literary critique by the Italian duoFruttero & Lucentini.

On 7 January 1914 theDickens Fellowshiporganised a dramatic ""trial"" in the King's Hall,Covent Garden, in which John Jasper stood accused of the murder of Edwin Drood. Appearing as witnesses in ""court"" were five characters from the Dickens novel, as well as a jury and court officials, mostly played by writers, actors and other leading personalities of the day.

G. K. Chesterton, best known for theFather Brownmystery stories, was the Judge. The author ofThe Complete Edwin Drood,J. Cuming Walters, led the prosecution, while W. Walter Crotch andCecil Chestertonacted for the defence, and the latter's future wife,Ada Elizabeth Jones(appearing under her pseudonymMiss J. K. Prothero) was Princess Puffer.Bransby Williams, well known for his stage monologues as Dickens characters, was Anthony Durdles. Authors and scholarsArthur Waugh, C. Sheridan Jones and Mrs Laurence Clay, played Crisparkle, Bazzard and Helena Landless respectively, while the part of John Jasper was taken by amateur actor Frederick T. Harry.[19]

Foreman of the jury wasGeorge Bernard Shaw. Other jurors were selected from a list of nineteen named in the programme.  A copy of this, annotated by its original owner, suggests that the others on the jury bench wereWilliam Wymark Jacobs,William Pett Ridge,Tom Gallon,William de Morgan,Arthur Morrison, Raymond Paton,Francesco Berger,Ridgwell Callum,Justin Huntly McCarthy,Oscar BrowningandWilliam Archer.[19]

Proceedings were very light-hearted; Shaw in particular made wisecracks at the expense of others present. For instance, Shaw said that if the prosecution thought that producing evidence would influence the jury then ""he little knows his functions"".[20]

The jury returned a verdict ofmanslaughter, Shaw stating that it was a compromise on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to convict Jasper but that they did not want to run the risk of being murdered in their beds. Both sides protested and demanded that the jury be discharged. Shaw said the jury would be only too pleased to be discharged. Chesterton ruled that the mystery of Edwin Drood was insoluble and fined everyone, except himself, for contempt of court.[21]

To date, there have been four film adaptations ofThe Mystery of Edwin Drood.

The first two silent pictures released in 1909 (British)[22]and 1914 (American)[23]are unavailable to the general public and have been little seen since they were released. They were followed by:

The Mystery of Edwin Drood(1960) was a British television miniseries produced byITVand broadcast live in eight episodes, starringDonald Sindenas John Jasper,Richard Pearsonas Mr Crisparkle andTim Seelyas Edwin Drood.[24]This serial is believed to be lost, as no audio or video recordings are known to exist. Photographs taken from contemporary newspaper clippings exist with theBFI.

There wasa 2012 BBC television version, adapted with an original ending byGwyneth Hughesand directed byDiarmuid Lawrence, which aired on BBC Two on 10 and 11 January 2012 and on the PBS seriesMasterpieceon 15 April 2012.[25][26]

Taina Edvina Druda(The Mystery of Edwin Drood) is a TV miniseries produced in Russia in 1980, adapted by Georgiy Kapralov and Alexander Orlov, directed by Alexander Orlov and with music byEduard Artemiev. The cast includedValentin Gaft, Avangard Leontiev,Elena KorenevaandMargarita Terekhova.

On 5 and 12 January 1953, the CBSSuspenseradio programme aired a two-part adaptation ofThe Mystery of Edwin Drood. It depicts John Jasper (played byHerbert Marshall) as the killer, tricked into giving himself away.[27]

In 1965, forRadio 4's long-running ""Saturday Night Theatre"",Mollie Hardwickadapted the novel and suggested an ending.[28]The cast includedFrancis de Wolffas the Narrator, John Gabriel as John Jasper,Mary Wimbushas Princess Puffer,Patrick Barras Crisparkle,Malcolm Terrisas Edwin Drood,Rosalind Shanksas Rosa, Nigel Graham as Neville Landless, Isabel Rennie as Helena Landless andDenys Blakelockas Mr Grewgious. It was repeated on 4 October 1970.[29]The play is held in the BBC Archives (T42136, 89'40""), and an off-air recording exists.

A five-part adaptation based on the Leon Garfield completion written by David Buck and directed by Gordon House was broadcast asBBC Radio 4'sClassic Serialfrom 3 to 30 March 1990.[30]The cast includedIan Holmas Jasper,John Moffattas Datchery,Gareth Thomasas Crisparkle,Michael Cochraneas Tartar,Timothy Batesonas Sapsea,Gordon Gostelowas Durdles andAnna Cropperas Mrs Tope;Mary Wimbushreprised her 1965 role of Princess Puffer and John Gabriel returned to play the role of Mr Grewgious.  It was last repeated onBBC Radio 4 Extrafrom 27 September to 1 October 2021.

A 10-part adaptation in 15-minute daily episodes, this time written byMike Walkerand directed byJeremy Mortimer, was broadcast onBBC Radio 4from 21 December 2020 to 1 January 2021.[31]The cast includedPippa NixonasKate Dickens(who acts as both narrator and commentator), Joel MacCormack as John Jasper, Isabella Inchbald as Rosa,Damian Lynchas Crisparkle, Rachel Atkins as Princess Puffer, Maanuv Thiara as Neville Landless, Halema Hussain as Helena Landless,Peter Davisonas Mr Grewgious and Iwan Davies as Edwin Drood. Some characters, including Lt Tartar and Mayor Sapsea, are omitted from this version and Bazzard, though mentioned by Mr Grewgious, does not appear. In this adaptation, Helena disguises herself as Dick Datchery, Edwin Drood survives the attack from Jasper, and Jasper kills himself by jumping from the cathedral tower after it is revealed that he was in love with Edwin, a major departure from his character and motivations in the original novel and other adaptations."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72855,The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unpleasantness_at_the_Bellona_Club,"On the afternoon of 10 November, ninety-year-old General Fentiman is called to the deathbed of his estranged sister, Lady Dormer. He learns that, under the terms of her will, he stands to inherit most of her substantial fortune (money sorely needed by his grandsons, Robert and George Fentiman). However, should the General die first, nearly everything will go to Lady Dormer'scompanionAnn Dorland.

Lady Dormer dies the next morning,Armistice Day, and that afternoon the General is found dead in his armchair at the Bellona Club. Dr Penberthy, a club member and the General's personal physician, certifies death by natural causes but is unable to state the exact time the General died. As the estate would amply provide for all three claimants, the Fentiman brothers suggest a negotiated settlement, but Ann Dorland absolutely refuses. Wimsey is asked to investigate the General's time of death.

Oddly enough, nobody saw the General arrive at the club at his usual time of 10 am. His manservant reports that the General did not return home after visiting Lady Dormer the day before. An unknown man by the name of Mr Oliver had telephoned to say that the General would be spending the night with him. Robert Fentiman says that he knows of Oliver, and much time is spent chasing the elusive individual through several countries before Robert admits that he does not actually exist.

Wimsey discovers that General Fentiman began to feel unwell while visiting his sister, and left her house to visit Dr Penberthy. The General then travelled to the club, meeting George Fentimanen route. At the club, the General informed Robert of the terms of the will; later, Robert discovered his grandfather had died of heart failure in the club library. Annoyed at losing his inheritance, Robert concealed the body overnight and invented Oliver to cover up the death. The next day, while the club members had stepped outside to observe the usualtwo minutes' silenceat 11 am, Robert moved the body to the armchair.

Wimsey believes the General's death is too convenient to be natural and has the body exhumed. An autopsy proves the General was poisoned by an overdose of the heart medicationdigitalis. When it becomes known that the body will be exhumed, Ann Dorland, who has an obvious motive, suddenly and suspiciously agrees to the proposed compromise with the Fentimans.

Wimsey finds Ann Dorland distressed by the callous and humiliating behaviour of Dr Penberthy, to whom she had been secretly engaged. It was he, with an eye on her expected inheritance, who had insisted she should refuse the compromise and fight for the whole estate. When it became known that the General would be exhumed, Penberthy broke the engagement off, giving highly insulting reasons. He had hoped that Ann would be embarrassed into silence, but Wimsey manages to get the truth from her.

Wimsey works out what had happened. When the General had consulted Dr Penberthy after seeing his sister, he had mentioned that under the terms of the will Ann Dorland would not inherit if Lady Dormer were to die before he did. To ensure that that did not happen, Penberthy prescribed the General a massive dose of digitalis, to be taken later that evening when Penberthy would not be in attendance. Contriving to be present later when the body was discovered, Penberthy was able to certify a natural death without  arousing suspicion, in spite of Robert's intervention which initially confused the time.

Penberthy writes a confession publicly exonerating Ann Dorland, and shoots himself in the club library. The three original claimants to the estate meet to divide it equitably, and Robert begins courting Ann.

Writing in 1990 Katherine Kenny described the book as the most successful of Sayers' early fiction, coupling a slick detective plot with vivid details of post-war English life. ""The book is a tightly constructed little drama based upon the old joke about an Englishman's club so stuffy that its dead members cannot be differentiated from the living – a pertinent comment upon the society so described.”[2]

In 1973 the novel was the subject of aBBC TV mini-seriesstarringIan Carmichaelas Wimsey.[3]In 1975 it was broadcast on BBC radio as a serial in six 30-minute parts, also starring Ian Carmichael."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9556,A Study in Scarlet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet,"In 1881,Doctor John Watsonreturns toLondonafter serving in theSecond Anglo-Afghan Warand starts looking for a place to live. An old friend of his named Stamford tells him thatSherlock Holmesis looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at221B Baker Streetbut cautions Watson about Holmes's eccentricities. Holmes and Watson meet and, after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes is a ""consulting detective"", and his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes'sdeductiveskills, Watson's disbelief turns into astonishment.

Atelegramrequests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to thecrime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson andLestradeare already on the scene. The victim is Enoch Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is ""RACHE"" (German for ""revenge""), which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber's body, they discover a woman's gold wedding ring.

Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys afacsimileof it, hoping to draw the murderer – who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring – out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise.

A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He went to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson stayed before the murder. Drebber, a drunk, attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. He, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with acudgelbut claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.

Stangerson is later murdered. His body is found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written ""RACHE"". The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying ""J.H. is in Europe"", and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sicklyScottish Terrierin residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier.

A young street urchin named Wiggins then arrives. He is the leader of theBaker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins has summoned a cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. The captive cabby is Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

In Utah'sSalt Lake Valleyin 1847, John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party ofpioneers, are rescued from death by a party ofLatter-day Saintsled byBrigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later in 1860, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church's Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn never to marry his daughter to a Mormon, sends word to Hope.

Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope arrives on the eve of the last day, and they all escape under cover of darkness.  The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed by Stangerson while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies less than a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson but begins to suffer from anaortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. After returning years later, he learns Drebber and Stangerson have fledSalt Lake Cityafter a schism between the Mormons. Drebber is now wealthy from Lucy's estate and Stangerson has become his secretary. For over 20 years Hope pursues them; in Cleveland, Ohio, Hope recognizes Drebber who has Hope imprisoned for a few months as a ""rival in love"". After being released, Hope tracks them to Europe through France, Russia, Denmark and to England.

In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier's son, Drebber gets into Hope's cab and spends hours drinking. Hope then takes him to the house on Brixton Road and forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write ""RACHE"" on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills. However, Stangerson attacks him and Hope stabs him in the heart.

Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he deduced the murderer's identity. In the newspapers, Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

Arthur Conan Doylewrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks.[4]As a doctor in general practice inSouthsea,Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodicalLondon Society. The story was originally titledA Tangled Skeinand was eventually published byWard, Lock & Co. in the 1887 edition ofBeeton's Christmas Annual, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed forroyaltybut instead received £25 in return for the full rights (equivalent to £3,371.95 considering inflation). It was illustrated byDavid Henry Friston.

The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock & Co, and featured drawings by the author's father,Charles Doyle. In 1890,J. B. Lippincott & Co.released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock & Bowden Limited (formerly Ward, Lock & Co.) was illustrated byGeorge Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt.[5]Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.

According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter-day Saints' organisation as being steeped inkidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: ""all I said about theDaniteBand and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It's best to let the matter rest.""[6]Conan Doyle's daughter has stated: ""You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.""[6]Historians speculate that ""Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books byFannie Stenhouse,William A. Hickman, William Jarman,John HydeandAnn Eliza Young, among others"",[6]in explaining the author's early perspective on Mormonism.

Years after Conan Doyle's death,Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that the author had privately apologised, saying that ""He [Conan Doyle] said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church""[6]and had ""written a scurrilous book about the Mormons.""[7]

In August 2011, theAlbemarle County, Virginia, school board removedA Study in Scarletfrom the district's sixth-grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons.[8][9]It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth-graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.[10]

As the first Sherlock Holmes story published,A Study in Scarletwas among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a Britishsilent filmbe produced byG. B. Samuelson. In the film, titledA Study in Scarlet, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story.[11]As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now alost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 filmThe Valley of Fear.[12]

A two-reel short film, also titledA Study in Scarlet, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starredFrancis Fordas Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.[12]

The 1933 film titledA Study in Scarlet, starringReginald Owenas Holmes andAnna May Wongas Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel.[13]Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names (Jabez Wilson, etc.).[13]The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later inAgatha Christie's novelAnd Then There Were None.[14]

Edith MeiseradaptedA Study in Scarletinto a four-part serial for the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, withRichard Gordonas Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.[15]

Parts of the story were combined with ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" for the script of ""Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes"", one of multiple radio adaptations featuringJohn Gielgudas Holmes andRalph Richardsonas Watson. The episode first aired on theBBC Light Programmeon 5 October 1954 and also aired onNBC Radioon 2 January 1955.[16]

The story was adapted for the1952–1969 BBC radio seriesin 1962 byMichael Hardwick, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson. It aired on theBBC Home Service.[17]

Another British radio version of the story adapted by Hardwick aired on 25 December 1974, withRobert Powellas Holmes andDinsdale Landenas Watson. The cast also includedFrederick Trevesas Gregson,John Hollisas Lestrade, andDon Fellowsas Jefferson Hope.[18]

A radio dramatisation of the story aired onCBS Radio Mystery Theaterduring its1977 season, withKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[19]

A Study in Scarletwas adapted as the first two episodes of the BBC's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series. The two-part adaptation aired onRadio 4in 1989, dramatised byBert Coulesand starringClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, andJohn Moffattas Inspector Gregson.[20]

It was adapted as a 2007 episode of the American radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes, Lawrence Albert as Watson,Rick Mayas Lestrade, and John Murray as Gregson.[21]

In 2023, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the beginning of the story in its first episode, ""Mr Sherlock Holmes"", but only alloded to the mystery itself at the very end and in the following episode. It starred Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

The1954–1955 television series(withRonald Howardas Holmes andH. Marion Crawfordas Watson) used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode ""The Case of the Cunningham Heritage"".[22]

The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television seriesSherlock Holmes,[23]withPeter Cushingin the lead role andNigel Stockas Dr Watson.

It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979Soviettelevision film,Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson(the first episode combines the story of their meeting with ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band""; the second episode adapts the actual Jefferson Hope case).[24]

A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, withPeter O'Toolevoicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O'Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time.

A Study in Scarletis one of several stories not adapted forthe television seriesstarringJeremy Brettbetween 1984 and 1994.

Steven Moffatloosely adaptedA Study in Scarletinto ""A Study in Pink"" as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television seriesSherlockfeaturingBenedict Cumberbatchas a 21st-century Sherlock Holmes, andMartin Freemanas Dr Watson.[25]The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled ""RACHE"" and the two pills, and the killer's potentially fatalaneurysm(although it is located in his brain rather than his aorta). However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also featuresMoriarty's presence. The first meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted again in the Victorian setting in the special ""The Abominable Bride"".

""The Deductionist"", an episode ofElementary, contains many elements of Hope's case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, ""A Study in Charlotte"".

""The First Adventure"", the first episode of the 2014NHKpuppetry seriesSherlock Holmes, is loosely based onA Study in Scarletand ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons"". In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school calledBeeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. ""Scarlet Story"", the series' opening theme tune, is named after the novel.[26]The name of ""Beeton School"" is partially inspired byBeeton's Christmas Annual.[27]

A Study in Scarletwas illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz forClassics Illustratedcomics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form byInnovation Publishingin 1969 by James Stenstrum and illustrated by Noly Panaligan, bySterling Publishingin 2010 byIan Edgintonand illustrated byI. N. J. Culbard, and by Hakon Holm Publishing in 2013 illustrated

In 2014,A Study in Scarletwas adapted for the stage by Greg Freeman, Lila Whelan and Annabelle Brown for Tacit Theatre.[29]The production premiered atSouthwark Playhousein London in March 2014.[30]

In February 2019, a new adaptation of ""A Study in Scarlet"" was staged at DM Performance Works at the Factory in Nuremberg, PA. It was adapted by Bill Amos under the title ""Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Avenger"".[31]

In June 2022,Pitlochry Festival Theatreproduced a new adaptation by playwright and actor Lesley Hart,Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Lipstick, Ketchup and Bloodperformed in an outdoor amphitheater by two performers. The production usesA Study in Scarletas a play within a play set in a post-apocalyptic future.[32]

In hisNaked Is the Best Disguise(1974),Samuel Rosenbergnotes the similarity between Jefferson Hope's tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence inJames Joyce's novelUlysses, though of course Joyce's work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg's book.

The British fantasy and comic book writerNeil Gaimanadapted this story to the universe of horror writerH. P. Lovecraft'sCthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled ""A Study in Emerald"" (2004) and is modelled with a parallel structure.

InGarage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders(2016), the second murder is an imitation of this murder.

InThe Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve, a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75476,The poisoned chocolates case,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poisoned_Chocolates_Case,"After arriving at his London club at 10:30 am precisely, which he has been doing every morning for many years, Sir Eustace Pennefather, a known womanizer whose divorce from his current wife is pending, receives a complimentary box of chocolates through the post. Disapproving of such modern marketing techniques, Sir Eustace is about to throw away the chocolates in disgust but changes his mind when he learns that Graham Bendix, another member of the club whom he hardly knows, has lost a bet with his wife Joan and now owes her a box of chocolates. Bendix takes the box home and, after lunch, tries out the new confectionery together with his wife. A few hours later Joan Bendix is dead, whereas her husband, who has eaten far fewer chocolates, is taken seriously ill and hospitalized (but later recovers). The police can establish a few facts beyond any doubt: that the parcel was posted the previous evening nearThe Strand; that the poison that was injected into each of the chocolates isnitrobenzene; and that the accompanying letter was typewritten on a piece of stationery from the manufacturers of the chocolates but not composed or sent by them.

Quite soon in the police investigations it becomes evident that the intended victim was Sir Eustace himself rather than the innocent Joan Bendix: no criminal could have predicted Sir Eustace giving away the box of chocolates to a man he hardly knew who just happened to be present when it was delivered. However, at a loss as to the further details of the crime, Scotland Yard conclude that the sender must have been some maniac or a fanatic trying to rid society of one of its most immoral members.

Worthy pillars of society including abarrister, a writer of detective novels, and a female author, the members of Roger Sheringham's Crimes Circle go about individually solving the case. After a week has passed, they present their findings on consecutive nights to their colleagues. Not surprisingly, they come up with various suspects: Sir Eustace's estranged wife; the father of a young lady whom Sir Eustace intended to marry after his divorce got through; one of Sir Eustace's discarded mistresses; and some more. At the very end of the novel, however, there is no doubt as to the identity of the perpetrator."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9558,The Sign of the Four,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four,"In 1888 MissMary Morstanarrives with a case. She explains that ten years earlier, her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, disappeared immediately after arriving in London. Mary contacted his friend, Major Sholto, who denied having seen him. Four years later, she received a valuable pearl in the post, a gift repeated once a year for six years. With the sixth pearl, she received a letter asking for a meeting, claiming that she is a ""wronged woman"".

Holmes takes the case, and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died a week before Mary received the first pearl. The only further clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk, appended with the words ""The Sign of the Four: Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar,"" and four small cross-like symbols.

Following the letter's instructions, Holmes, Watson, and Mary go to theLyceum Theatre; there, they meet a coachman who takes them to the house of Major Sholto's son Thaddeus, the anonymous sender of the pearls. He reveals that Captain Morstan did, in fact, visit Major Sholto, demanding his half of a treasure that Sholto had secretly brought back fromIndia. In the ensuing quarrel, Captain Morstan suffered a heart attack and died, striking his head on the treasure box as he fell. Afraid he would be suspected of murder, Major Sholto buried the body and hid the treasure, leaving out a small goldchapletstudded with twelve pearls. Thaddeus and his twin brother Bartholomew only learned of this when their father revealed it while on his deathbed; he was about to reveal to them where the treasure was hidden, when a bearded man appeared at the window and the Major died of fear. The brothers tried and failed to catch the intruder; later on, they found a note pinned to the Major's body, which read ""The Sign of Four"". Thaddeus began sending Mary the pearls to make things right, and the brothers searched for the treasure. Six years later, Bartholomew found and withheld it; Thaddeus then contacted Mary so they could both confront Bartholomew and demand their shares.

The party, now accompanied by Thaddeus, heads to Bartholomew's house, Pondicherry Lodge,Upper Norwood. As they enter the house, the worried housekeeper reveals that Bartholomew has locked himself in his laboratory and refuses to come out. Mary Morstan stays downstairs to comfort the housekeeper, while the others rush up to the laboratory door; through the keyhole, they can see Bartholomew Sholto slumped in his chair,  with a ""fixed and unnatural grin"" upon his face. Holmes and Watson break down the door, to discover Bartholomew in a state ofrigor mortis. Upon further inspection of the body, Holmes discovers a poisonous thorn above Bartholomew's ear. The treasure box is also gone, though there is a hole in the ceiling where it used to be.

While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces from footmarks and other clues that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged white man named Jonathan Small, and a smallAndamaneseaccomplice, who accidentally stepped increosote. Borrowing Toby, a trained scent hound, from a naturalist, Holmes traces the pair to a boat landing. Learning that Small has hired a steamlaunchnamed theAurora, Holmes, with the help of theBaker Street Irregularsand his own disguises, traces the boat to arepair yard. In a police launch, Holmes and Watson pursue theAurorawhen it flees the yard; the islander attempts to shoot a dart at Holmes, and is shot dead himself. Small attempts to flee, running theAuroraaground, but is captured. However, the treasure box is now empty; Small, not wanting to surrender the gems, had scattered them into theThamesduring the chase.

Small confesses that he was once a soldier of the ThirdBuffsin India, and lost his right leg to acrocodilewhile bathing in theGanges. He then became an overseer on anindigoplantation; the1857 rebellionoccurred, and he was forced to flee to theAgra fortress. While standing guard one night, he was overpowered bySikhtroopers, who gave him a choice; be killed, or help themwaylayAchmet, a disguised servant of an outlawedrajah, who had sent Achmet with a box of jewellery to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place, but the crime was discovered, although the hidden jewels were not. Small and his accomplices got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands.

Some years later, Small learned that Major Sholto and Captain Morstan, who were guards at the convict barracks, had lost money playing cards. Small saw his chance, and made a deal with the officers; Sholto would recover the treasure, and in return send a boat to pick up Morstan, Small, and the Sikhs so they could all meet and divide it. However, Sholto stole the treasure for himself, returning to England after inheriting a fortune from his uncle. Morstan went after Sholto but never returned, and Small vowed vengeance against Sholto. Four years later, Small escaped prison with the help of Tonga, an islander whose life he had once saved. It was the news of this escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location, but left the note in the room anyway as revenge for the treatment of himself and the Sikhs. When Bartholomew eventually found the treasure, Small only planned to steal it; however, a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew before Small could stop him. Small decides the treasure brings nothing but bad luck to anyone who has it; to Achmet and Bartholomew, death; to Major Sholto, fear and guilt; and for Small himself, penal servitude for life.

Mary is left with no treasure, save the pearls; however, she and Watson have fallen in love over the course of the adventure, and the loss of the treasure has removed anybarriersthere might have been between them. Watson reveals that he has proposed to Mary and that she has accepted, much to the annoyance of Holmes.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyledescribed how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner withJoseph Marshall Stoddart, managing editor of the American publicationLippincott's Monthly Magazine, at theLangham Hotelin London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version ofLippincott’swith a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended byOscar Wilde, who eventually contributedThe Picture of Dorian Grayto the July 1890 issue.[1]Doyle discussed what he called this ""golden evening"" in his 1924autobiographyMemories and Adventures.

The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition ofLippincott's Monthly Magazine[2]asThe Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos, appearing in both London andPhiladelphia.[3]The British edition of the magazine originally sold for ashilling, and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars.

Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re-serialisations gave the title asThe Sign of Four. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 bySpencer Blackett, again using the titleThe Sign of Four.[1]This edition included a frontispiece illustrated byCharles H. M. Kerr.[4]The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second ""the"" of the original title.

AGermanedition of the book published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. An edition published byGeorge Newnes Ltdin 1903 was illustrated byF. H. Townsend.[5]

Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four-word form.[1]The actual text in the novel nearly always uses ""the Sign of the Four"" (the five-word form) to describe the symbol in the story, although the four-word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story.

As with the first story,A Study in Scarlet, produced two years previously,The Sign of the Fourwas not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards inStrand Magazine, that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.

There have been multiple film and television adaptations of the book:

A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on New York radio stationWGYon 9 November 1922. The cast included Edward H. Smith as Sherlock Holmes, F. H. Oliver as Dr. Watson, and Viola Karwowska as Mary Morstan. It was produced as part of a series of adaptations of plays, so it is likely that the script was based on an existing stage adaptation of the story (one was written by John Arthur Fraser in 1901 and another by Charles P. Rice in 1903).[6]

A six-part adaptation of the novel aired in the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Adapted byEdith Meiser, the episodes aired from 9 November 1932 to 14 December 1932, withRichard Gordonas Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.[7]

The book was adapted byFelix Feltonfor theBBC Light Programmein 1959.Richard Hurndallplayed Holmes andBryan Colemanplayed Watson.[8]

On Saturday 2 March 1963, the story was dramatised byMichael Hardwickfor theBBC Home Serviceas part of the1952–1969 radio series, as a ninety-minute episode onSaturday-Night Theatre, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson.[9]

CBS Radio Mystery Theateraired a radio version of the story in 1977, starringKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[10]

The Sign of the Fourwas adapted for radio byBert Coulesin 1989 as part ofBBC Radio 4's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series, withClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, and featuringBrian Blessedas Jonathan Small.[11]

In 2016, the story was adapted as an episode of the American radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.[12]

In 2024, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the story in a ten-episodes adventure called ""The Sign of Four"", starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

Paul Giovanni's 1978 playThe Crucifer of Bloodis based on the novel. The Broadway premiere featuredPaxton Whiteheadas Holmes and Timothy Landfield as Watson. The 1979 London production featuredKeith Michellas Holmes andDenis Lillas Watson."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/434,The Circular Staircase,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circular_Staircase,"Rachel Innes is a spinster who has had custody of her orphaned niece and nephew since they were children. The siblings Halsey and Gertrude are now 24 and 20, respectively, and they talk Rachel into renting a house in the country for the summer.  
The country-house is owned by the Armstrong family (who are currently away on vacation), and currently only has a housekeeper named Mary.

Upon arriving Rachel and her long-time maid Lydia set about hiring staff and setting up in the house before Halsey and Gertrude arrive the next day.  They receive an ominous warning that there is a ghost in the house from Thomas, an older man who has worked for the Armstrongs for many years and agrees to return and work as a butler for Rachel.  The first night Lydia and Rachel are awoken by the sounds of an intruder sneaking around and dropping a metal golf stick on a staircase.  
The next morning Gertrude and Halsey arrive along with Jack Bailey, a local banker who is a friend to Halsey and engaged to Gertrude.

The next night Rachel is again woken by a loud sound and a dead body is found at the bottom of a circular set of stairs.  The police arrive led by Detective Jamieson and the body is identified as Arnold Armstrong, the estranged son of the house owner Paul Armstrong.  Halsey and Jack are both missing and while searching for them Rachel discovers Halsey's pistol thrown into a tulip bed.  She hides this discovery from the police who question both her and Gertrude.  Gertrude provides an alibi for Halsey and Jack, claiming they left just before Arnold was shot to death.

Rachel is determined to remain in the house until the mystery is solved and her nephew is cleared of all suspicion despite the fact that there continue to be break-ins and mysterious tapping noises during the night.  A few days later Halsey returns without Jack and refuses to provide any explanations.  Jack and Halsey both had a poor relationship with Arnold because Arnold treated Gertrude badly.  The day Halsey returns news breaks that the local bank (which is owned by Paul Armstrong, and where Jack works, and also where Halsey and Gertrude keep their substantial inheritance) has gone bankrupt because someone who worked there stole a bunch of money.  Suspicion immediately falls on the missing Jack Bailey, who turns himself into police custody that day proclaiming his innocence.

Jack is released from police custody due to claimed illness.  Rachel continues to investigate and hires a new gardener on the recommendation of Halsey.  She discovers that Thomas and the housekeeper Mary have been hiding a very ill Louise Armstrong (the step-daughter of Paul Armstrong and fiance of Halsey) in the groundskeeper's house.  News arrives that Paul Armstrong has died due to heart disease and poor health.  Thomas the groundskeeper dies of a fright-induced heart attack not much later.

The stable is lit on fire as a distraction so someone can break into the house, but Rachel realizes this and manages to shoot the would-be-burglar in the foot but the burglar still gets away.  Louise breaks off her engagement with Halsey against her own wishes to marry the local Dr. Walker.  Late at night Detective Jamieson and the new gardener wake up Rachel and take her to a graveyard, where they dig up the grave of Paul Armstrong and determine that the body in the grave is not that of Paul Armstrong.  When Halsey finds out he takes off angrily, and then his car is found crashed into a train with him still missing.  Halsey remains missing for several days until finally being discovered tied up in a train car by a hobo.  Investigation into the bank fraud determines it was Paul Armstrong who stole the money, not Jack Bailey.  Paul Armstrong had then hid the money in his house in a secret room and faked his own death, promising Dr. Walker a marriage with his stepdaughter Louise if Walker would go along with the plan.  Paul and Walker had been the burglars trying to break into the house over the past month.

Paul dies when he falls down the stairs while fleeing from the police after breaking into his mansion again.  Arnold Armstrong was shot by the housekeeper Mary, who was the sister of Arnold's secret ex-wife.  Mary's sister had died giving birth to Arnold's child and Mary had been raising the child without any help from Arnold for several years.  After Arnold was disinherited from his family he began to blackmail Mary by threatening to take his child away from her if she did not give him money.  He also beat her with a golf stick.  Jack Bailey had disguised himself as the new gardener to help with the investigation and ultimately cleared his name of all charges and marries Gertrude.  Halsey and Louise also got back together after her stepfather died.

In 1912, Rinehart's friend Beatrice DeMille, mother ofCecil B. Demille, tried to work out a deal for her son's new film company to purchase the rights toThe Circular Staircaseand another Rinehart story. Though this failed to come together, Rinehart was soon able to sell her work to film companies, beginning with a group of comic stories thatEssanay Studiosadapted asshort filmsin 1914.[6][7]In 1915, Rinehart sold the film rights toThe Circular StaircasetoSelig Polyscope Companyfor an apparently small amount.[8]Thesilent film, released in 1915, was the firstfeature-lengthadaptation of Rinehart's work.[6]It was directed byEdward LeSaintand starredGuy Oliveras Halsey,Eugenie Bessereras Ray, andStella Razetoas Gertrude.[9]It received lukewarm reviews; one critic wrote that it followed the novel too closely to be effectively cinematic.[10]The film is nowlost.[9]

Just a few days after the wedding, various incidents lead Valeria to suspect her husband of hiding a dark secret in his past. She discovers that he has been using a false name, ""Woodville"", when his true surname is ""Macallan"". Eustace refuses to discuss it, leading them to curtail their honeymoon and return to London where Valeria learns
that he was on trial for his first wife's murder by arsenic. He was tried in a Scottish court and the verdict was 'not proven' rather than 'not guilty'. This implies that, though the jury believe Eustace to be guilty, it did not have enough proof to convict him.

Valeria sets out to save their happiness by proving her husband innocent of the crime. In her quest, she comes across the disabled character Miserrimus Dexter, a fascinating but mentally unstable genius, and Dexter's devoted female cousin, Ariel. Dexter will prove crucial to uncovering the disturbing truth behind the mysterious death.

Wilkie Collins explores themes of disability with the character of Miserrimus Dexter, who his depicted as a handsome and highly intelligent dandy despite the loss of his lower limbs. It is his detective genius that brings the narrative to a conclusion. Despite popular perceptions of the disabled in Victorian society, Collins demonstrates that there is no clear divisions between the disabled and the able-bodied. In his decadence, Dexter also embodies the public views of sensation literature.[3]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75359,The crime at Black Dudley,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crime_at_Black_Dudley,"The story begins as the guests assemble for dinner on the first night of a house party. Black Dudley is a remote, ancient and sprawling manor house with a long and complex history, its numerous changes of use resulting in plenty of hidden rooms and secret passages. The pile is owned by the family of Wyatt Petrie, a popular young academic, and inhabited by his uncle by marriage, Colonel Coombe, a sickly recluse who wears a mask to cover unsightly scars. The bulk of the guests are young friends of Petrie – among them our red-headed hero George Abbershaw, pathologist and occasional consultant toScotland Yard, and similarly flame-haired Meggie, whom he shyly admires. The Colonel's medic Doctor White Whitby, and two of his associates, a shifty Englishman named Gideon and an imposing but silent foreigner going by the name of Benjamin Dawlish, are also present. So is one Albert Campion, garrulous and affable, but, George soon learns, unknown to either Petrie or the Colonel.

After dinner, the guests notice a sinister, bejewelleddaggerhanging above the fireplace; Petrie tells them a story of its ancient origins in the family, and mentions a ritual involving the dagger being passed from hand to hand round the darkened house. The guests are keen to play the game, so the servants are dismissed, the lights extinguished and the ritual begins.

Abbershaw, not excited at the prospect of people waving daggers around in the dark, slips outside to check on his car; in the garage, he finds the mysterious Mr Campion loitering around. Admiring the Colonel's ancient car, they find it has been converted to contain a powerfulRolls-Royceengine. The two head back into the house to see the end of the game, and find Meggie in a state of shock. The knife was handed to her at some point, and then snatched away again, but not before she realised the blade was covered in blood.

When the lights are finally restored, they hear the Colonel has fallen ill and has been taken to bed. The party breaks up for the night, but as George prepares for bed he is visited by Prenderby, a young newly qualified doctor, who has been shown Coombe's body and been asked by Doctor Whitby to sign forms allowing a rapidcremation, but, nervous and suspicious, has refused. Abbershaw is next to be asked, and entering the room he at once pulls the sheet from the bed. Although there are no obvious signs of foul play, Abbershaw's experience tells him the man did not die of heart failure, as Whitby claims. Also, his mask has slipped, revealing an unmarked face beneath. Abbershaw is forced to sign the forms, but plans towireLondon the next day, to delay the cremation until a proper investigation can be carried out.

Later that night, the house is woken by loud noises, and they find Campion fighting wildly with one of the servants. Abbershaw finds a leather case on the ground, which he later opens, burning the document it contains and secreting the case. He talks with Meggie and her friend Anne, finding that Campion had met Anne in London, informed her he was invited to the party and got a lift down in her car.

The next day, Whitby and the chauffeur depart early with the body. At breakfast, the imposing Mr Dawlish makes a stark announcement – the cars have been drained of fuel, and no-one is to leave the house until something he has lost is returned to him. A brave youngrugby-player attempts to escape in a car powered by alcohol, but is shot and wounded.

Campion, having mocked their captors, disappears, but later materialises, dusty and shaken, in Abbershaw's wardrobe. He tells them he has been roughly interrogated and locked up, but escaped through a secret passage, and also that he came to the house on a mission from an unknown, to collect an item from the Colonel and return to London with it. He retrieved the item, but was prevented from leaving by Abbershaw's presence in the garage, and then lost it in the fight with the chauffeur. He has also recognised the crooks, and names Dawlish as Eberhard von Faber, the head of a powerful criminal gang, one of the deadliest men in Europe.

Abbershaw hears that Meggie has been taken for questioning, and angered at the thought of the villains mistreating her, he uses Campion's passage to reach their lair. He too is questioned, and then locked up with Meggie. They speak to an eccentric servant locked up next door, and find that the criminals were as surprised as anyone at the Colonel's death. Campion releases them, and they form a plan to overpower the villains. After much fighting and danger, they retake the house, and are about to flee to safety when the chief villains return and recapture them.

Abbershaw reveals that he has burned their document, the plans for an audacious crime, and the party is locked upstairs, while the gang prepare to leave the house, leaving it on fire with the guests trapped inside. Just in time, the localhuntride by, with a friend of Campion's among them. Hearing the prisoners' cries for help, the hunt rides up, are incensed by the German's behaviour, and, as he tries to flee, cause his car to crash, crushing him.

The party breaks up and all return to London, where Campion impresses Abbershaw with the name of his mother before disappearing. Abbershaw, Prenderby and another man from the party find the converted car, and follow it to find Dr Whitby and the chauffeur about to flee the country by air. He denies killing the Colonel, and departs.

Abbershaw, after some thought and research, pays a visit to the killer – Petrie himself. Having fallen in love with a young girl, he found she was the puppet of evil criminals, and enraged by their treatment of her, he resolved to track them down. When he found his own uncle was one of them, he felt he had no choice but to slay him, inventing the dagger ritual to give him the chance. Abbershaw lets him go, on condition he enters amonastery.

The hero ofThe Crime at Black Dudleyis George Abbershaw; Campion starts as a minor character, and grows far faster than the other characters do. This is most evident when Allingham takes time to explain when and why Abbershaw changes, while Campion's development seems to happen naturally.

Apparently, Allingham intended Abbershaw to be the hero/sleuth of this book and any future mysteries. He is, after all, a pathologist, and that could lead to many interesting stories. Campion got in the way and manages to become a far more memorable character, so much so that the American publishers strongly encouraged Allingham to focus on Campion.

Even in this first Campion novel, there are hints of his willingness to work outside the law. Though he and Scotland Yard are familiar with one another, it is clear that he is not working in any official capacity. Abbershaw had even encountered Campion before, although Campion was using a different name.

Campion's mysterious past is also brought out. He admits to using a number of names, and that Campion is not his real one (Mystery Milehas more information). Campion goes so far as to mention the name of his mother to Abbershaw, who is struck speechless by the revealed name. Could he be one ofEdward VII's illegitimate children? He never really hints at who his father was, and to British readers in the late 1920s the thought may have been natural.

If Campion was developed to poke fun at other sleuths, most notablyDorothy Sayers'Lord Peter Wimsey,The Crime at Black Dudleyshows a glimmer of a character that will stand very much on his own."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8624,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes,"All of the stories withinThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesare told in afirst-person narrativefrom the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories.[7]TheOxford Dictionary of National Biographyentry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmestend to point out social injustices, such as ""a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent.""[1]It suggests that, in contrast,  Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of ""official incompetence and aristocratic privilege"".[1]The Adventures of Sherlock Holmescontains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories toThe Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"" (as his favourite), ""The Red-Headed League"" (second), ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (fifth) and ""The Five Orange Pips"" (seventh).[8]The book was banned in theSoviet Unionin 1929 because of its alleged ""occultism"",[9]but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.[10]

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere well received upon their serialisation inThe Strand Magazine.[24]Following the publication of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in July 1891, theHull Daily Maildescribed the story as being ""worthy of the inventive genius"" of Doyle.[25]Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion ofThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in theBelfast News Letterreviewed a story by another author inThe Strand Magazinesaying that it ""might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago"", but that ""the unique power"" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories.[26]TheLeeds Mercuryparticularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, ""with all his little foibles"",[24]while in contrast theCheltenham Looker-Ondescribed Holmes as ""rather a bore sometimes"", noting that descriptions of his foibles ""grows wearisome"".[27]The correspondent forHampshire Telegraphlamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such asMicah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author ""who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want"".[28]

Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the characterhas been playedby over 70 different actors in more than 200 films.[29]A number of film and television series have borne the title ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", but some of these are either original stories,[30]combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation ofThe Sign of the Four.[31]

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story.[32]Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty'sElementaryand theBBC'sSherlock,[33]even though in the story itself, the narration claims: ""It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.""[32]In hisSherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes ""the Canonprovides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.""[34]

Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921–1923Stoll film series(all except ""The Five Orange Pips""),[35]the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(1930–1936),[36]the 1939–1950 radio seriesThe New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(all except ""The Beryl Coronet""),[37]and the BBC Sherlock Holmes1952–1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in theGranada TelevisionseriesSherlock Holmeswhich ran from 1984 until 1994.[38]The stories inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmeswere dramatised forBBC Radio 4in 1990–1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series,[39]and were adapted as episodes of the radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(2005–2016).[40]The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.

He went out the first night that he was there, and came back after midnight when the rest of the household had gone to bed. Since then, neither Mrs. Warren, her husband, nor their servant girl has seen him.

After the landlady leaves, Holmes remarks toDr. Watsonthat it seems likely that the person in Mrs. Warren's house is not the bearded man who made the arrangements. Holmes suspects that messages are being sent to the lodger.

Holmes and Watson go to Mrs. Warren's house and spy on the lodger, who they discover to be a young woman with a dark complexion. That evening, Holmes and Watson are on hand to see the lodger's confederate send messages by a waving candle.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1585,The Wrong Box,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Box_(novel),"Masterman Finsbury and his brother Joseph are the last survivors of atontinein which they were enrolled as children along with 35 other young boys. Each child had a thousand pounds deposited in his name. The last of them to survive will receive the entire capital along with the accrued interest.

Masterman is now 73 and feeling his age. He lives a secluded life in the house of his son, Michael, a prominent lawyer. Joseph, two years younger, is in good health and leads an active life. He is the guardian of two nephews, Morris and John, and of the daughter of a friend, Julia Hazeltine. Having lost the combined fortunes of his three wards in the leather trade, he makes  his house over to them, but this still leaves a deficit of £7,800. Morris agrees to support Joseph and Julia in return for Joseph's interest in the tontine.

Joseph and his wards are on holiday inBournemouthwhen Morris becomes convinced that Masterman has died. Suspecting Michael of concealing the death, he rushes back to London with Joseph and John (Julia having gone on ahead). But their train crashes, leaving many dead and injured. In the confusion, Morris and John discover what they think is Joseph's body, but it is in fact that of another passenger who happens to be dressed similarly to Joseph. Aware that Joseph's death would rob them of the tontine, they hide the body in a temporary grave. Morris proposes that they send the body to London in a crate, and that they find a cottage to rent where John can stay, pretending that Joseph is staying with him. Meanwhile, Morris will go straight back to London to hide the crate in his basement. John reluctantly agrees to the plan, despite the fact that they can only find a run-down cottage in a dismal location.

Meanwhile, Joseph walks away from the crash site unharmed. Wishing to escape his nephews' company, he sets out for London alone. Michael happens to be on the same train, travelling with his friend, Geoffrey Wickham, a magistrate. Catching a glimpse of Joseph, they avoid him by ducking into the luggage van, where they notice two large packages. One is a barrel in which Morris has packed what he thinks is Joseph's body; the other is an enormous crate addressed to a Mr Pitman. After Michael returns to a passenger compartment, Wickham mischievously swaps the labels on the two consignments.

The enormous crate duly arrives at Morris's house. Gideon Forsyth, a lawyer and friend of Julia, happens to be passing. He helps Julia to get the crate into the house. They discover that it contains a huge statue of Hercules. Morris arrives and is greatly distressed to discover that the barrel has not arrived. AtWaterloo Stationhe learns that the barrel was delivered to Pitman. In a fit of anger, he destroys the statue of Hercules.

Pitman, who is an artist, consults Michael, who is his lawyer, about the unexpected arrival of the barrel and the non-arrival of the statue. They break open the barrel, and are horrified to find that it contains a corpse. Afraid that they will be implicated in a murder, Michael arranges for his piano to be delivered to Pitman's house. He removes the strings and hides the body inside. Using assumed names, the two men visit Forsyth and engage him to act in a breach of promise case, sending him on a wild goose chase to Hampton Court. While he is away, they have the piano delivered to his house.

Forsyth in turn is horrified to discover the body in the piano. In order to get rid of it, he rents a houseboat and arranges for the piano to be sent there so that he can tip the corpse into the river. He is surprised to find that another houseboat moored nearby is that of his uncle, and that Julia is a guest on board. When Julia then comes on board his own boat in order to do some sketching, he is forced to explain the situation to her. Julia and the uncle agree to help him dispose of the body.

In fact, the piano never arrives. The carrier has been intercepted by a thief, who gets the carrier drunk and steals the cart along with its cargo. Nothing further is seen or heard of the piano.

John returns to London, having had a miserable time at the cottage. Michael summons John and Morris to his office, where they find Joseph alive and well. They learn that Masterman is also still alive. Michael offers to pay Morris and John the £7,800 that Joseph owes them and to hand them back control of the leather business, the financial situation of which has greatly improved. In return, Michael will acquire Joseph's interest in the tontine. Morris and John agree, which means that Michael will now receive the tontine regardless of who dies first.

Rudyard Kipling, in a letter to his friend Edmonia Hill (dated 17 September 1889), praised the novel:

The Wrong Boxwas filmed in 1966 starringMichael Caine.[4]The novel was also adapted as a stage musical in 2002, and a studio cast recording of the show was released in August 2013.[5]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8615,A Study in Scarlet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet,"In 1881,Doctor John Watsonreturns toLondonafter serving in theSecond Anglo-Afghan Warand starts looking for a place to live. An old friend of his named Stamford tells him thatSherlock Holmesis looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at221B Baker Streetbut cautions Watson about Holmes's eccentricities. Holmes and Watson meet and, after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes is a ""consulting detective"", and his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes'sdeductiveskills, Watson's disbelief turns into astonishment.

Atelegramrequests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to thecrime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson andLestradeare already on the scene. The victim is Enoch Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is ""RACHE"" (German for ""revenge""), which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber's body, they discover a woman's gold wedding ring.

Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys afacsimileof it, hoping to draw the murderer – who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring – out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise.

A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He went to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson stayed before the murder. Drebber, a drunk, attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. He, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with acudgelbut claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.

Stangerson is later murdered. His body is found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written ""RACHE"". The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying ""J.H. is in Europe"", and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sicklyScottish Terrierin residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier.

A young street urchin named Wiggins then arrives. He is the leader of theBaker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins has summoned a cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. The captive cabby is Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

In Utah'sSalt Lake Valleyin 1847, John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party ofpioneers, are rescued from death by a party ofLatter-day Saintsled byBrigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later in 1860, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church's Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn never to marry his daughter to a Mormon, sends word to Hope.

Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope arrives on the eve of the last day, and they all escape under cover of darkness.  The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed by Stangerson while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies less than a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson but begins to suffer from anaortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. After returning years later, he learns Drebber and Stangerson have fledSalt Lake Cityafter a schism between the Mormons. Drebber is now wealthy from Lucy's estate and Stangerson has become his secretary. For over 20 years Hope pursues them; in Cleveland, Ohio, Hope recognizes Drebber who has Hope imprisoned for a few months as a ""rival in love"". After being released, Hope tracks them to Europe through France, Russia, Denmark and to England.

In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier's son, Drebber gets into Hope's cab and spends hours drinking. Hope then takes him to the house on Brixton Road and forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write ""RACHE"" on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills. However, Stangerson attacks him and Hope stabs him in the heart.

Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he deduced the murderer's identity. In the newspapers, Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

Arthur Conan Doylewrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks.[4]As a doctor in general practice inSouthsea,Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodicalLondon Society. The story was originally titledA Tangled Skeinand was eventually published byWard, Lock & Co. in the 1887 edition ofBeeton's Christmas Annual, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed forroyaltybut instead received £25 in return for the full rights (equivalent to £3,371.95 considering inflation). It was illustrated byDavid Henry Friston.

The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock & Co, and featured drawings by the author's father,Charles Doyle. In 1890,J. B. Lippincott & Co.released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock & Bowden Limited (formerly Ward, Lock & Co.) was illustrated byGeorge Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt.[5]Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.

According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter-day Saints' organisation as being steeped inkidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: ""all I said about theDaniteBand and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It's best to let the matter rest.""[6]Conan Doyle's daughter has stated: ""You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.""[6]Historians speculate that ""Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books byFannie Stenhouse,William A. Hickman, William Jarman,John HydeandAnn Eliza Young, among others"",[6]in explaining the author's early perspective on Mormonism.

Years after Conan Doyle's death,Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that the author had privately apologised, saying that ""He [Conan Doyle] said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church""[6]and had ""written a scurrilous book about the Mormons.""[7]

In August 2011, theAlbemarle County, Virginia, school board removedA Study in Scarletfrom the district's sixth-grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons.[8][9]It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth-graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.[10]

As the first Sherlock Holmes story published,A Study in Scarletwas among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a Britishsilent filmbe produced byG. B. Samuelson. In the film, titledA Study in Scarlet, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story.[11]As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now alost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 filmThe Valley of Fear.[12]

A two-reel short film, also titledA Study in Scarlet, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starredFrancis Fordas Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.[12]

The 1933 film titledA Study in Scarlet, starringReginald Owenas Holmes andAnna May Wongas Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel.[13]Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names (Jabez Wilson, etc.).[13]The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later inAgatha Christie's novelAnd Then There Were None.[14]

Edith MeiseradaptedA Study in Scarletinto a four-part serial for the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, withRichard Gordonas Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.[15]

Parts of the story were combined with ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" for the script of ""Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes"", one of multiple radio adaptations featuringJohn Gielgudas Holmes andRalph Richardsonas Watson. The episode first aired on theBBC Light Programmeon 5 October 1954 and also aired onNBC Radioon 2 January 1955.[16]

The story was adapted for the1952–1969 BBC radio seriesin 1962 byMichael Hardwick, withCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson. It aired on theBBC Home Service.[17]

Another British radio version of the story adapted by Hardwick aired on 25 December 1974, withRobert Powellas Holmes andDinsdale Landenas Watson. The cast also includedFrederick Trevesas Gregson,John Hollisas Lestrade, andDon Fellowsas Jefferson Hope.[18]

A radio dramatisation of the story aired onCBS Radio Mystery Theaterduring its1977 season, withKevin McCarthyas Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.[19]

A Study in Scarletwas adapted as the first two episodes of the BBC's complete Sherlock Holmes1989–1998 radio series. The two-part adaptation aired onRadio 4in 1989, dramatised byBert Coulesand starringClive Merrisonas Holmes,Michael Williamsas Watson, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, andJohn Moffattas Inspector Gregson.[20]

It was adapted as a 2007 episode of the American radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes, Lawrence Albert as Watson,Rick Mayas Lestrade, and John Murray as Gregson.[21]

In 2023, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the beginning of the story in its first episode, ""Mr Sherlock Holmes"", but only alloded to the mystery itself at the very end and in the following episode. It starred Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

The1954–1955 television series(withRonald Howardas Holmes andH. Marion Crawfordas Watson) used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode ""The Case of the Cunningham Heritage"".[22]

The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television seriesSherlock Holmes,[23]withPeter Cushingin the lead role andNigel Stockas Dr Watson.

It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979Soviettelevision film,Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson(the first episode combines the story of their meeting with ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band""; the second episode adapts the actual Jefferson Hope case).[24]

A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, withPeter O'Toolevoicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O'Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time.

A Study in Scarletis one of several stories not adapted forthe television seriesstarringJeremy Brettbetween 1984 and 1994.

Steven Moffatloosely adaptedA Study in Scarletinto ""A Study in Pink"" as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television seriesSherlockfeaturingBenedict Cumberbatchas a 21st-century Sherlock Holmes, andMartin Freemanas Dr Watson.[25]The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled ""RACHE"" and the two pills, and the killer's potentially fatalaneurysm(although it is located in his brain rather than his aorta). However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also featuresMoriarty's presence. The first meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted again in the Victorian setting in the special ""The Abominable Bride"".

""The Deductionist"", an episode ofElementary, contains many elements of Hope's case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, ""A Study in Charlotte"".

""The First Adventure"", the first episode of the 2014NHKpuppetry seriesSherlock Holmes, is loosely based onA Study in Scarletand ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons"". In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school calledBeeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. ""Scarlet Story"", the series' opening theme tune, is named after the novel.[26]The name of ""Beeton School"" is partially inspired byBeeton's Christmas Annual.[27]

A Study in Scarletwas illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz forClassics Illustratedcomics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form byInnovation Publishingin 1969 by James Stenstrum and illustrated by Noly Panaligan, bySterling Publishingin 2010 byIan Edgintonand illustrated byI. N. J. Culbard, and by Hakon Holm Publishing in 2013 illustrated
by Nis Jessen.[28]

In 2014,A Study in Scarletwas adapted for the stage by Greg Freeman, Lila Whelan and Annabelle Brown for Tacit Theatre.[29]The production premiered atSouthwark Playhousein London in March 2014.[30]

In February 2019, a new adaptation of ""A Study in Scarlet"" was staged at DM Performance Works at the Factory in Nuremberg, PA. It was adapted by Bill Amos under the title ""Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Avenger"".[31]

In June 2022,Pitlochry Festival Theatreproduced a new adaptation by playwright and actor Lesley Hart,Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Lipstick, Ketchup and Bloodperformed in an outdoor amphitheater by two performers. The production usesA Study in Scarletas a play within a play set in a post-apocalyptic future.[32]

In hisNaked Is the Best Disguise(1974),Samuel Rosenbergnotes the similarity between Jefferson Hope's tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence inJames Joyce's novelUlysses, though of course Joyce's work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg's book.

The British fantasy and comic book writerNeil Gaimanadapted this story to the universe of horror writerH. P. Lovecraft'sCthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled ""A Study in Emerald"" (2004) and is modelled with a parallel structure.

InGarage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders(2016), the second murder is an imitation of this murder.

InThe Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve, a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life."

The holiday ends when the localvicarMr. Roundhay and his lodger Mortimer Tregennis visit Holmes, asking for his assistance. The night before, Tregennis had gone to visit his three siblings, playedwhistwith them, and then left. The next morning, thehousekeeperfound the trio still sitting in their places at the table; the brothers, George and Owen, had gone insane, and the sister, Brenda, was dead.

Dr. Leon Sterndale, a famous hunter-explorer and a cousin of the Tregennises, aborts his sailing fromPlymouthafter the vicar wires him with the tragic news. He asks Holmes what his suspicions are, and is displeased when Holmes will not voice them.

The next morning, the vicar informs Holmes that Mortimer Tregennis has died in the same way as his sister. The two men, along with Watson, rush to Mortimer's room. A lamp is lit and smoking on the table beside the dead man. Holmes deduces that a poison, activated by combustion and affecting the cognitive functions, is the murder weapon; there were fires burning in both murder rooms, and people who entered them either felt ill or fainted. After a dangerous experiment in which he tests the residue of the poison on himself and is only just rescued by Watson, Holmes reveals that Mortimer Tregennis is guilty of the first crime and further deduces that Dr. Sterndale was Mortimer's murderer.

Dr. Sterndale confesses that he held Mortimer at gunpoint and forced him to breathe the poison. It comes from a plant called the Devil’s-foot root. Sterndale once described the powder to Mortimer Tregennis, who later stole some from Sterndale's collection of African curiosities, then murdered his siblings by throwing it on the fire just before he left. It is revealed that Sterndale was passionately in love with Brenda Tregennis, but was still married to and unable to divorce his first wife who had abandoned him years ago. Holmes' sympathies in this matter lie with Sterndale, and he tells him to go back to his work in Africa and never return.

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/74643,"The Italian, Volume 1 (of 3) :  or, the confessional of the Black Penitents",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Italian_(Radcliffe_novel),"The plot starts in Naples, Italy in around 1764, in the church of Santa Maria del Pianto, where an English traveller is speaking with an Italian friar. The Englishman notices a man of extraordinary appearance in a shadowy area of the church, who is an assassin, according to the friar. When the Englishman asks why this assassin is protected in the church, an Italian friend travelling with him directs his attention to a famous confessional in the church, which was the scene of a particularly startling confession. He offers to send him a narrative relating this former assassin's confession, and the problems that attended it, to his hotel, and the two retire from the church and go their separate ways. The Englishman reads the story in his hotel room as follows:

In 1758, in the church of San Lorenzo in Naples, Vincentio di Vivaldi sees the beautiful Ellena di Rosalba with her aunt, Signora Bianchi. Vivaldi is struck with her beauty, and intends to court her, with the hopes that they will end up married. When Vivaldi's mother, the proud Marchesa, hears about his love for a poor orphan, she appeals to her ambitious and cunning confessor, Father Schedoni, to prevent the marriage, with a promise that she will help him obtain promotion in his order. As Vivaldi continues to visit Signora Bianchi at Villa Altieri, he is approached by a monk, who seems to be an apparition, threatening him to keep away from the villa and Ellena.  After each encounter, Vivaldi tries in vain to capture the strange monk, with the help of his friend Bonarmo and his faithful servant Paulo. Vivaldi suspects that the monk is Father Schedoni, and is determined to know why his courtship of Ellena is discouraged. After being promised the hand of Ellena and appointed her guardian by Signora Bianchi before her sudden mysterious death, Vivaldi finds that Ellena has been kidnapped from the villa, and immediately deduces it is by the hand of the Marchesa and Schedoni. Leaving Naples secretly in pursuit of her abductors, Vivaldi and Paulo eventually find Ellena held at the remote convent of San Stefano, at the mercy of a cruel Lady Abbess, and Vivaldi infiltrates the convent disguised as a religious pilgrim to rescue her. In the convent, Ellena befriends a lovely but melancholy nun, Sister Olivia, who helps her escape from the convent into the care of Vivaldi.

While riding towards Naples after the escape, Vivaldi presses Ellena for an immediate marriage, and she finally consents. But moments before they are to take their vows before a priest at a church, agents claiming to work for the Inquisition, informed by Schedoni, interrupt and arrest Vivaldi on the false charge of abducting a nun from a convent. Vivaldi and Paulo are taken to the prisons of the Inquisition in Rome to be questioned and put to trial. They are confused about the circumstances behind their confinement, which their captors will not reveal.  Ellena, however, is sent by order of Schedoni to a lone house on the seashore, inhabited only by the villain Spalatro, Schedoni's accomplice in previous crimes, to be murdered. Schedoni comes to the house to assassinate Ellena personally, but becomes convinced from a portrait on her person that she is his daughter. Schedoni has a change of heart, and decides to take Ellena personally back to Naples to hide her from the Marchesa. While on their journey, they once again encounter the dismissed Spalatro, who had followed them with designs of extorting money from Schedoni, but Spalatro is shot in a scuffle and left behind (and shortly after dies of fever). Schedoni and Ellena arrive in Naples, where Schedoni places Ellena in the convent of Santa Maria del Pianto until Vivaldi can be freed. Schedoni returns to the Marchesa, keeping secret his endorsement of the marriage of the Marchesa's son and his daughter, but distracts the Marchesa temporarily with information that Ellena comes from a noble lineage, so a marriage would at least be proper, if not lucrative. Meanwhile, in the prison of the Inquisition, the mysterious monk who had previously eluded Vivaldi, now known to be Nicola di Zampari, appears and narrates to him the guilty crimes of Father Schedoni before he became a monk, and convinces him to formally call Schedoni and Father Ansaldo, to whom Schedoni had previously disclosed his deeds in a confessional booth, to the trial as the accused and witness, respectively, in the crimes. Both are made to appear before the tribunal, where Schedoni is convicted from their testimony of murdering his brother, as well as marrying and later stabbing his brother's wife in a jealous rage, in his former life as the dissolute Count di Bruno, or Count di Marinella. Schedoni is sentenced to death, and before he is led away into confinement, tells Vivaldi his relationship to Ellena and her whereabouts. Vivaldi is also escorted back to his cell, with the knowledge that the charges against him will be dropped. Meanwhile, Paulo (Vivaldi's servant) escapes the prison and notifies the Marchese of Vivaldi's situation, who hurries to Rome to secure his son's release. Schedoni, on his deathbed, in the presence of the tribunal, further reveals that he had already fatally poisoned both himself and his betrayer Nicola with poison concealed in his vest.

Back at the convent, Ellena distinguishes a voice all too familiar, and sees her dearly loved Sister Olivia in the convent courtyard. While the two recount each other's experiences since they last parted, Ellena's servant Beatrice comes to report the sudden death of the Marchesa from a long-dormant but natural illness (having Confessed, the Marchesa has also exacted a promise from her husband that he should sanction the marriage of Ellena and Vivaldi). Beatrice and Olivia recognise each other, and elate Ellena with the news that she is the daughter of Olivia, who is revealed to be the Countess di Bruno, whom Schedoni had stabbed in jealous rage and left for dead. This leads Ellena to realise that she is actually not Schedoni's daughter, but his niece. Since they are of the same lineage, Ellena is still from a noble family, which would allow her to marry Vivaldi with honour.  Once it is revealed that Ellena is from an aristocratic family, it is determined that she has the royal blood that allows her to be worthy of marrying Vivaldi.

The ending of the novel is a happy one; Vivaldi and Paulo are released from prison, Ellena is reunited with her mother, and Vivaldi and Ellena are joined in marriage, and all the villains have died.  The Marchesa dies shortly before finding out that her son has been freed from prison. Father Schedoni, condemned to die, poisons himself and Nicola di Zampari, and calls a tribunal including the Marchese and Vivaldi to witness their final confessions at his deathbed.

Ann Radcliffe uses the technique of scene imagery to evoke emotion in characters,[4]and to describe landscapes and surroundings in extreme detail. The most notable imagery in the novel are from art pieces and the picturesque. The actual artists ""mentioned were seventeenth century Italian artists with those works Mrs. Radcliffe was probably familiar"",[5]while the characters also turn into artists who paint portraits of other characters in their heads. Sculptures can be seen in the tribunal members of the Inquisition for their faces are unyielding and hard as stone, and even the flickering lamps cannot soften their facial expressions.

Aside from imagery being described as physical art, Radcliffe includes images of personification, animals, religion, storms, magic, and enchantment. As noted by E.J. Clery, ""Radcliffe's heroines are women of imagination. By their taste for scenery and aptitude for fancy they transform the plots of sentimental fiction into otherwordly romance: they are effectively the co-authors of their own stories"".[6]Images in the novel make it possible to see one thing in the expressions of something else,[7]reason as to which Radcliffe creates anxiety from descriptions of terror and theuncanny. ""Thesolemnityof the scene accorded with the temper of his mind, and he listened in deep attention for returning sounds, which broke upon his ear like distant thunder muttering imperfectly from the clouds"". (page 12 Oxford World Classics Edition) All of the imagery presented inThe Italianpull the novel together by way of description, which sets the scene for the reader and the characters.

Ann Radcliffe's writing falls under the genre of theFemale Gothic, which is distinguished by the use of the explained supernatural. The Female Gothic differs from the Male Gothic in that elements initially perceived as supernatural are eventually revealed to have rational explanations, rather than serving as indicators of an actual ghost of otherworldly entity. These explanations largely serve to expose a true human threat, often the desire and motivations of characters seeking control and power over others. The Female Gothic also tends to advocate against injustice committed against female characters, ascribing these heroines with more agency and independence than was typical for representations of the time as well as the genre of the Gothic itself. Speaking of Diana Wallace's book,Female Gothic Histories: Gender, History and the Gothic, Yael Shapira concludes that the Female Gothic ""helps articulate women's experiences and their problematic status in both history and historiography"".[8]This differs from the traditional style of the Male Gothic, which Wallace feels is limited by the inherent biases of a male perspective. In this sense, the Female Gothic ""extended engagement with the ways in which the feminine has historically been constructed through male eyes"" (106).[9]As Kröger and Miller explain, ""Ghosts are spooky but the true threat was one she saw in the real world: men who were willing to abuse women in order to gain wealth"" (24).[10]

The Italianwas first announced in December 1796. At the time of the novel's release, Ann Ward Radcliffe was already a well-known and well-received Gothic writer. She had gained fame from several of her earlier works, most noticeablyThe Romance of the Forestin 1791 andThe Mysteries of Udolphoin 1794. Her reputation was successful enough to allow her to be read by learned gentlemen as well as young men and women. Because the term 'gothic story' was not commonly used in this period of time, Radcliffe's contemporaries used the term 'romance' to describe her genre. This term was classified as writing about miraculous tales through the use of poetic prose.[11]This poetic element was referred to in multiple reviews of Radcliffe'sThe Italianand is considered to be the defining characteristic of the author's many Gothic works. This unique characteristic of her writing set the author apart from other writers of the time and earned her a reputation through the appraisal she received from many well-respected literary voices of the time. In general praise for the author, SirWalter Scottcalled her ""the first poetess of romance fiction""; whileNathan Drakewrote that she was, ""the Shakespeare of Romance writers"". He believed that her readers valued her unrivaled ability to create – to realise visually – an enchanted, storied, and landscaped past.[11][12]

In a time where writing novels for commercial consumption was one of the only means through which a female author could earn a respectable living,The Italianwas a great financial success for Radcliffe. Because of her reputation and earlier success, the author earned £800 from the original copyright of the novel, which was considered a very large sum for a female author and was unparalleled by many of Radcliffe's contemporaries.[13]

The Italianprompted a wide variety of both favourable and unfavorable reviews, making the overall reception of the novel very mixed. To some critics, it was the high point of Ann Radcliffe's short but productive career; to others, it represented a distinct decline in form from her earlier products.

Most reviewers were united in believing that the monk Schedoni was the most successful character that Radcliffe had created in any of her novels. Characterised as a man governed by an amalgam of anger, hypocrisy and guilt, the monk was praised as standing apart from the traditional conventions of Gothic protagonists, and many readers approved of his strong personality.[14]Not only was he considered one of the best characters, but one of the best villains; he had ""great energy, with strong passions, and inordinate pride; sometimes softened by the feelings of humanity, but preserving the firmnesss of his mind in the most trying situations"".[15]However, many of these reviews found a fault in the extent of his wicked nature, and others asserted that Radcliffe's careful handling of his character and attempt to implement a touch of parental affection to soften him only served to make him seem less realistic.[16]

Reviews that were run in response toThe Italianecho these tensions between approval and disappointment in what would be the final novel of Radcliffe's Gothic career. The writer of an 1827 review in theUnited States Review and Literary Gazettedeclares his belief thatThe Italianis Radcliffe's ""greatest work,"" paying particular reverence to the ""masterly dialogues"" in several key scenes, including the interview between Marchesa and Schedoni in the church of San Nicolo as well as the discussion between Schedoni and Spalatro, in which the later refuses to murder Ellena.[17]The writer of a 1797 review inThe Monthly Reviewpraised Radcliffe's visual and descriptive language in the novel, citing ""the part…which displays the greatest genius, and the most force of description, is the account of the scenes which passed in the long house on the shore of the Adriatic, between Schedoni, Ellena, and Spalatro: – The horrible sublimity which characterises the discovery made by the former that Ellena was his daughter, at the instant in which he was about to stab her, was perhaps unparalleled"".[18]This style of 'painting the sublime' reflects the preference for allegorical or transcendent imagery over physical or realistic imagery in the Gothic literary and artistic period. Originating in the works of Edmund Burke'sOn the Sublime and Beautiful, which also parallels Radcliffe's preference in the use ofterroroverhorrorin her novels.[19]Similarly, a later evaluation in theEdinburgh Reviewdescribed the mastery of Ann Radcliffe's narrative description as allowing the reader to almost see, feel and experience the events on the Mediterranean alongside the characters.[20]

However, various negative reviews emerged and had issues when comparingThe Italianto Radcliffe's earlier and more overwhelmingly successful pieces. Several articles commented on the difficulty the author had in maintaining her reputation after her early success. The writer ofThe English Review's article onThe Italianin December 1796 attempted to make a rational assessment of the disappointment that some people felt in reading the novel, saying that:
""It was impossible to raise curiosity and expectation to a higher pitch than she has done in herMysteries of Udolpho; yet these mysteries she accounted for in a natural manner"". Having been frightened perfectly by Radcliffe before, this critique believed that readers were likely prepared for the twists ofThe Italian. There was also some unfavorable criticism of the scenes dealing with the Spanish Inquisition, which are sometimes considered too unrealistic or ridiculous to be believable to the audience.[21]A review inThe Critical Reviewfrom June 1798 stated that, ""Among those parts of the romance which we disapprove, we may reckon the examination before the court of inquisition:  it is so improbable, that we should rather have attributed it to one of Mrs. Radcliffe's numerous imitators"". Despite this, the review went on to say that there still remained several scenes that would successfully seize the imagination and interest the passions of readers.[22]

Following Radcliffe's retirement after this novel at the young age of thirty-two, and her death a few decades later, public opinion of her overall works includingThe Italianswung to a more positive light. Upon her death in 1823, the political and social atmosphere in England had changed again and Radcliffe regained positive assessments of her importance in the history of Gothic writers. In her obituary in theNew Monthly Magazine, she was described as ""the able authoress of some of the best romances that ever appeared in the English language;"" in theLiterary Gazetteshe was, ""the finest writer in this kind of fiction that ever existed;"" and in theGentleman’s Magazineshe was noted to have produced romances that we able to be translated into 'every European tongue' to the 'honour of the country.'[23][24]

The Italianprovides an in depth look into Radcliffe's portrayal of the Catholic Church as cruel, arrogant, and corrupt.[25]The character Schedoni solidifies the Church as an opposing force. He is murderous, manipulative, hypocritical, and above all else he represents the ""un-English"" way of life. Unlike Ellena, whom, like the rest, is Italian, and represents the ideal behavior of English women. She is both mentally and materially independent.[26]Ellena's clear ""Englishness"" separates her from the foreign background of Italy and the villainous church. Although the church is painted in a negative light, likely due to Radcliffe's own Protestant ideology, the convent Santa Maria del Pianto is shown as a refuge from ""motherhood, wifehood, and the heterosexual lover.""[27]The convent provides intellectual and spiritual freedom for women. In the convent, Ellena was able to establish herself through small tasks and female connections. Ellena showcases the importance of the female attempts at self-definition.[28]

The veil (nun's habit)– The veil, used by Ellena to aid her escape with Vivaldi after being captured, was given to her by Sister Olivia. This veil appears almost obsessively through the work, symbolising modesty, and reassuring protection and concealment of purpose.

Lewis and Radcliffe both influenced the tradition of the Gothic novel, but did so in different ways. Lewis wrote in the tradition of the masculine gothic, favoring depictions of horror, while Radcliffe preferred the evocation of terror, explaining in her essay ""On The Supernatural in Poetry"" her belief that ""terror and horror are so far opposite that the first expands the soul, and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes, and nearly annihilates them"" (Radcliffe).[30]As an already established author, Radcliffe was a large influence in Lewis's writing career. Their notoriety and aesthetic contrasts led to the two often being compared – even by the authors themselves. Even as recently as 2005, writers such as Vartan Messier compare their styles: ""The contrast between the two writers is obvious in their approach to the Gothic, and more particularly, in the explicitness of content and in their use of certain Gothic conventions.""[31]Unlike the characters in Lewis' novel, reviewers observed that Radcliffe illustrated that guilt and depravity can be constructed upon the desire for absolute power rather than mere sexuality, and their source is ultimately human rather than demonic.[32]The direction in which Gothic literature was moving, from terror to horror, may have inhibited Radcliffe from continuing her career. A gender comparison can also be seen betweenThe ItalianandThe Monk; Radcliffe indirectly depicts the desires that Lewis investigates explicitly.[33]

There are few scholarly texts commenting on the direct influence ofWilliam Shakespeareon the stories and rhetoric of Radcliffe. It would only take a casual reader of both writers, however, to spot the similarities betweenThe Italianand many of Shakespeare's works: ""When one author not only makes allusions to the work of another, but also frequently directly quotes him, the case for influence can be firmly established. That Ann Radcliffe had a thorough knowledge of Shakespeare can be deduced from her use of his quotations as chapter headings to foretell succinctly the action of her novels. Even in the texts of the novels, phrases from Shakespeare appear, and these are not always the well-known phrases"".[34]The plays were also acted quite frequently in Radcliffe's day, so it is probable that ""Radcliffe had seen Shakespeare’s dramas performed"".[34]Radcliffe also referenced the plays of Shakespeare, includingHamletandThe Tempest, in her personal journal.[34]The ""sameness"" of her plots, a major criticism of Radcliffe, can also be attributed to her following theRomantic comedymodel of Shakespeare.[34]

""In [The Italian], her last critically acclaimed novel, she leaned heavily on the plots of Shakespeare"".[34]The plot follows the three stages of the romantic comedy model and parallels many of Shakespeare's plays including ""the thwarted love"" present inRomeo and Juliet, the villa scene where Vivaldi overhears Ellena nearly a facsimile of the balcony scene;[35]Olivia's reappearance after years of faking her death mirroring the character Hermione, and Olivia's daughter Ellena being brought up in a lower class than her birth mirroring the Hermione's daughter Perdita inThe Winter's Tale;[36]the play within the play wherein Schedoni sees his own actions depicted just asClaudiusdoes inHamlet, as well as Schedoni murdering his brother and marrying his wife just as Claudius;[37]the ""aura of superstition and fear"" that Schedoni and Spalatro experience while preparing to kill Ellena ""is almost taken verbatim fromMacbeth”, as Spalatro sees the ghost of the man he killed, just asMacbethseesBanquo, and both men experience the delusional states of paranoia both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth experience during and after Duncan's murder;[38]Schedoni mimicsIagofromOthelloas he psychologically manipulates other characters, and his manipulations are the catalyst for the major conflicts in the plot.[34][39]

The characters themselves also appear to mimic the characteristics of Shakespeare's heroes, heroines and villains. Ellena has the beloved status ofJulietwith the pride ofCordeliafromKing Lear; Vivaldi is the passionate lover likeRomeo; and Father Schedoni, the most developed character in the novel, is a manipulator like Iago, tortured by his love for Ellena just asOthellois tortured by his love forDesdemona, faces the oncoming, inevitable consequences of his bloodshed just as Macbeth.[34][40]

The animalistic imagery used to describe Schedoni is also taken verbatim from the works of Shakespeare. He is described as a ""serpent"" mirroring language fromMacbeth,A Midsummer Night's Dream, andRomeo and Juliet; he is described as a ""tiger"" mirroring language fromRomeo and Juliet,King Lear,Macbeth, andRichard III; a ""vulture"" mirroring the language ofKing Lear,Macbeth, andTitus Andronicus; a ""basilisk"" mirroring language inRichard III,The Winter’s Tale, andCymbeline.[34][41][42][43][44]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2344,The Adventure of the Cardboard Box,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Cardboard_Box,"Miss Susan Cushing of Croydon receives a parcel in the post that contains two severed human ears packed in coarse salt. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience.

Holmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, acabletoLiverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing's sister Sarah (Holmes was denied admittance by the doctor because she was having a ""brain fever"") convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing's other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary's estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings' house in Croydon (addressing it merely to ""S. Cushing""), not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah (rather than Susan) because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover.

Browner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes's information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reachesLondon. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story—morally if not legally—is Sarah Cushing, who fell in love with and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband's propensity for getting drunk (and being rather rough when so intoxicated). In the end, her husband's inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Holmes considers a ""crime of passion"".

The story was published in the UK inThe Strand Magazinein January 1893, and in the US inHarper's Weeklyon 14 January 1893. It was also published in the US edition of theStrandin February 1893.[1]InThe Strand Magazine, the story included eight illustrations bySidney Paget.[2]It did not include any illustrations inHarper's Weekly.[3]

""The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"" was not published in the first British edition ofThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, but it was published in the first American edition, though it was quickly removed because of its controversial subject matter.  The story was later published again in 1917 inHis Last Bow.  Even today, most American editions of the canon include it withHis Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place, within theMemoirs.[4]

When ""The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"" was removed from publication, Conan Doyle moved a passage from it that showed Holmes ""mind reading"" Watson to ""The Adventure of the Resident Patient"". (The text of the moved passage runs from ""Our blinds were half-drawn, and  Holmes lay curled upon the sofa"" to ""I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day."") This passage reveals Dr. Watson to be an avid admirer ofHenry Ward Beecher, whose portrait he keeps at his home. The passage seems to have little to do with the mystery but may be a subtle reference to the theme of adultery as Beecher was famously put on trial for the offense in 1875, an event many contemporary readers would have remembered.

The story was adapted as a short silent film titledThe Cardboard Boxin 1923, as one of the short films in theSherlock Holmes film seriesbyStoll Pictures. It starredEille Norwoodas Sherlock Holmes andHubert Willisas Dr. Watson.Hilda Anthonyplayed Mary Browner andJohnny Buttplayed James Browner.[5]

TheGranada TVadaptation withJeremy Brett, televised on 11 April 1994, was generally faithful to the original. In it, Browner was portrayed byCiaran Hinds.

TheElementaryepisode ""Ears to You"" is a loose adaptation of this story.

The 2018HBO Asia/Hulu JapanseriesMiss Sherlockloosely adapts this story as the episode ""Stella Maris.""

The story was adapted byEdith Meiseras an episode of the radio seriesThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired on 5 November 1931, featuredRichard Gordonas Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.[6]Another production of the story aired in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.[7]

Meiser also adapted the story forThe New Adventures of Sherlock Holmesfor episodes that aired in January 1940[8]and August 1943[9]withBasil Rathboneplaying Holmes andNigel Bruceplaying Watson.

The story was adapted for theBBC Light Programmein 1960 byMichael Hardwick, as part of the1952–1969 radio seriesstarringCarleton Hobbsas Holmes andNorman Shelleyas Watson.[10]

""The Cardboard Box"" was dramatised by Roger Danes forBBC Radio 4in 1994 as an episode of the1989–1998 radio seriesstarringClive Merrisonas Holmes andMichael Williamsas Watson (in the series forHis Last Bow). It featuredKevin Whatelyas Browner andTeresa Gallagheras Mary Browner; it also introducedStephen Thorneas Inspector Lestrade, who had previously been played by Donald Gee.[11]

In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of the radio seriesThe Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, withJohn Patrick Lowrieas Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.[12]

In 2024, the podcastSherlock&Coadapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called ""The Cardboard Box"", starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock."

Mathilde Stangerson, the 30-something daughter of the castle's owner, Professor Joseph Stangerson, was found near-critically battered in a room adjacent to his laboratory on the castle grounds, with the door still locked from the inside.  She recovers slowly but can give no useful testimony.  Rouletabille meets and interrogates several characters: the castle's concierges Mr & Mrs Bernier, the old servant Jacques, an unfriendly inn landlord and a womanising gamekeeper, and begins a friendly rivalry with France's top police detective Frédéric Larsan, who has been assigned the case.  Larsan suspects Ms Stangerson's fiancé, another scientist called Robert Darzac, to Rouletabille's dismay.

More attempts are made on Ms Stangerson's life despite Rouletabille and Larsan's protection, and the perpetrator appears to vanish on two occasions when they are closing in on him, echoing Professor Stangerson's research into ""matter dissociation"".  The gamekeeper is murdered during the second attempt.  Ultimately, Larsan arrests Darzac who is charged with murder attempts.  Rouletabille suspects that Darzac has secret reasons not to defend himself and he disappears to make further investigations.

Two-and-a-half months later, as Darzac's trial opens, Rouletabille reappears sensationally and tells the court that the culprit is Frédéric Larsan himself, whom he accuses of being an alter-ego of a master criminal called Ballmeyer.  Larsan appeared to vanish on the two occasions he was nearly collared as he was one of the pursuers.  Darzac is released when it emerges that Larsan has vanished after Rouletabille warned him he would accuse him in court.  The mystery of the locked Yellow Room is explained thus: Larsan assaulted Ms Stangerson earlier in the day than originally thought, but she hid the traces of the attack and locked herself away.  During the night, traumatised by the event, she fell off her bed and inflicted the gravest of the wounds by hitting her temple on the corner of her bed-side table.

The background to these events is kept secret in court but finally explained by Sainclair.  Ballmeyer, in a different guise, had seduced Ms Stangerson in her youth and married her secretly in theUnited States.  They had a child before he was arrested and his identity revealed to her.  Ms Stangerson had arranged for her son's care and education and hidden the whole saga from her father; her silence and Robert Darzac's behaviour were motivated by her desperation to keep him from finding out.  Ballmeyer however, hearing that she was engaged, had decided to reappear in her life and claim her as his wife once more, by force if necessary.

John Dickson Carr, a writer of locked-room mysteries, has his detective Dr. Gideon Fell declare this the ""best detective tale ever written"", in his novelThe Hollow Man(1935).[2]

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3180,A Double Barrelled Detective Story,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Double_Barrelled_Detective_Story,"The story contains two arcs of revenges.  In the primary arc, a rich young woman is abused, humiliated and abandoned by her new husband, Jacob Fuller, whom she married against the wishes of her father. The young Fuller resents her father's rejection and dismissal of him as a ne'er-do-well and resolves to exact his revenge by mistreating his new bride. After his abandonment, she bears a son, whom she names Archy Stillman. When the child gets older, the mother discovers that he possesses an incredible ability of smell, like a bloodhound. The mother instructs her child, now sixteen, to seek out his biological father with the intent of destroying that man's peace and reputation, and hence extracting satisfaction for her.

Five years later in a second arc, at a mining camp in California, Fetlock Jones, a nephew of Sherlock Holmes, kills his master Flint Buckner, a silver-miner, by blowing up his cabin. Since this occurs when Holmes happens to be visiting, Holmes applies his skills to bear upon the case and derives a logically worked conclusion that is proved to be abysmally wrong by Archy Stillman using his sense of smell. This could be seen by the reader as yet another piece where Twain tried to prove that life does not quite follow logic.

This is a satire by Twain on the mystery novel genre. In the second arc, Sherlock Holmes is depicted in employing ""scientific methods"" to a ridiculous degree, yet arriving at a completely wrong assessment. On the other hand, the crime is solved with a supernatural ability that no normal human possesses. Yet even this fails to reveal the whole truth, as the final twist of the story indicates.

Furthermore, Sam Clemens/Mark Twain broke through the ""fourth wall"" and appeared as himself in the middle of the story, supposedly while the story was being serialized, and responded to letters sent in by readers to the newspaper editor. During the exchange, Twain made fun of/self-advertised some of his other famous short stories.

The news is kept from him and his family so long as possible, and his death comes as a great shock.[4]Sir Thomas was aware that Dr. Jemmy Fox has fallen in love with his daughter Inez, and expresses to his friend Rev. Philip Penniloe his approval of the match should the girl herself care for the doctor. On the very night of the squire's funeral it is found that the grave has been rifled and the body stolen.[4]The only man with a clue to the mystery is a blacksmith who has been called up late at night by a mysterious party with a cart. He declares, on first telling of this, that he saw Dr. Fox with the cart, and this makes people suspect that Dr. Fox performed the sacrilege for medical purposes.[4]

Fox finds himself pointed at and shunned by nearly everybody in the parish of Perlycross. Lady Waldron, who never liked Fox, eagerly adopts the story.[4]He has however, an alibi, as at the time of the occurrence he had been summoned to a distant place where his father was ill. Penniloe and others remain staunch to him, and one or two of the villagers take his side.[4]Fox tries to see Lady Waldron, but she refuses him admittance; he, however, meets Inez, and not only finds that she does not believe the calumny, but that she reciprocates his affections.[4]Time passes, and there is no clue found to the mystery; everybody is worried over it, especially, of course, Lady Waldron and her daughter, Dr. Fox, and Mr. Penniloe. The mystery is only resolved on the return of Sir Thomas's son from abroad, as he proves to be the means of finding the solution.[4]

Perlycrosswas first published as three volumes in 1894.[5]

In reviewing the novel,The Spectatornoted that the story ""is much too slender to serve as the framework for a [three-volume] novel"" and that ""the book is in essence a study of rural life in south-western England.""[6]"

As a thief-taker, Wild's job was to capture criminals and take them to the authorities in order to collect a reward, but he made notorious profit from managing an underground network of malefactors who paid him to avoid being denounced. Fielding's biography of Jonathan Wild allows him to satirize various aspects of English society at the time.[2]It features an interpolated romantic story that is nowhere to be found in other accounts of the historical Wild. It has been argued that this was Fielding's way of rendering the criminal biography of Wild into a novel of the kind that was becoming increasingly popular in his time.[3]"

Eccles explains that he spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia's rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared, leaving him alone in the house. Eccles mentions that a note, delivered during dinner the previous evening, had caused great consternation to Garcia and may have had some connection with the household's disappearance.

Holmes' investigation leads him to the Henderson household, whose master has spent time in thetropics, and whose secretary is a dark-skinned foreigner. Holmes believes that the cryptic note came from this household and the writer could only be the house's governess, Miss Burnet, who has not been seen since the night of the murder.

Through her father and her worldly, cheerful cousin, Lady Monica Knollys, she gradually learns more regarding her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, ablack sheepof the family whom she has never met; once an infamousrakeand gambler, he is now apparently a fervently reformed Christian. His reputation has been tainted by the suspicioussuicideof a man to whom Silas owed an enormous gambling debt, which took place within a locked, apparently impenetrable room in Silas's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.

In the first part of the novel, Maud's father hires a Frenchgoverness, Madame de la Rougierre, as a companion for her. Madame terrifies Maud and appears to have designs on her: during two of their walks together, Maud is brought into suspicious contact with strangers that seem to be known to Madame. (In a cutaway scene that breaks the first-person narrative, we learn that she is in league with Silas's good-for-nothing son Dudley.) The governess is eventually dismissed when she is discovered by Maud in the act of searching her father's locked desk.

Maud is asked in obscure terms by her father, aSwedenborgian, if she is willing to undergo some kind of ""ordeal"" to clear the name of her uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, her father dies from a rupturedaneurysm. At the reading of hiswill, it emerges that he had added acodicilto it so that Maud will live with Silas, who becomes her guardian until she comes of age. However, the will allows that, if she were to die whilst still a minor, the estate would then pass to Silas. Lady Knollys, together with Austin'sexecutorand fellow Swedenborgian, Dr. Bryerly, attempts in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, Maud consents willingly to spending the next three and a half years at Bartram-Haugh.

Maud initially finds life at Bartram-Haugh strange but not unpleasant, despite ominous signs such as the uniformly unfriendly servants and Silas's malevolentfactotum, the one-legged Dickon Hawkes. Silas himself frightens Maud but is nonetheless seemingly kind to her, in contrast to his treatment of his own children, the loutish Dudley and the uneducated Millicent ('Milly'). Although Maud initially deprecates Millicent's rustic manners they become best friends, and each other's only source of companionship at the estate. During her stay, Maud is subject to various attempts by her cousin Dudley to court her, but she rejects him thoroughly on each occasion. Silas is periodically subject to mysteriouscatatonicfits, attributed to his massive consumption oflaudanum.

Various ominous happenings begin to take place at Bartram-Haugh, and it becomes increasingly difficult for Maud and Millicent to find any way out of the estate. Meanwhile, Dudley's courtship culminates in a marriage proposal to Maud; when she complains to Silas about it, he attempts to coax her into accepting. She is relieved when it is discovered that Dudley isalready married, and after being disowned by his father, he and his wife leave to set sail to Australia. Silas decides that Millicent should attend a boarding school in France, and sends her away with the promise that Maud is to join her after three months.

Maud is shocked to discover Madame de la Rougierre is residing at Bartram-Haugh in the employ of Silas, and suspects also that Dudley may not have left the country. Despite Maud's strong protests, Madame is charged with accompanying her first toLondon, and then on toDoverand across theEnglish Channel. After falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, Maud awakes to find herself again at Bartram-Haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to London and back. Maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of Madame, whilst everyone believes she is in France.

Remembering the earlier warnings of Meg Hawkes, Maud refuses to drink anything offered to her; instead, Madame, ignorant of Silas's true intentions, drinks druggedclaretintended for Maud and promptly falls asleep on Maud's bed. Later that night, Dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room, which is the one in which the supposed suicide took place; the window he uses is set upon concealed hinges that allow it to be opened only from the outside. Hidden out of sight, Maud witnesses Dudley brutally murder Madame in the near-darkness, mistaking her for Maud. Silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, Maud slips out undetected. Assisted by Dickon's daughter, whom Maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to Lady Knollys's estate, and away from Bartram-Haugh.

Silas is discovered in the morning lying dead of a laudanumoverdose, while Dudley becomes a fugitive and is thought to be hiding in Australia. Maud is happily married to the charming and handsome Lord Ilbury and ends her recollections on a philosophical note:

Uncle Silasremains Le Fanu's best-known novel. It was the source forArthur Conan Doyle'sThe Firm of Girdlestone,[2]and remains a touchstone for contemporary mystery fiction. There are also strong connections betweenUncle Silasand some ofWilkie Collins' novels, especiallyThe Woman in White; both writers, while recognisably within the Gothic tradition, depict heroines who are far more highly developed than the persecuted maidens ofAnn Radcliffeand others.[3]

A film version, also titledUncle Silas(though initially released in the United States asThe Inheritance), was made byGainsborough Studiosin 1947. It was directed by Charles Frank, withDerrick De Marneyas Silas  andJean Simmonsas the heroine (whose given name was changed from Maud to Carolyn).[4]

A feature-length British television adaptation was made for theThames TelevisionseriesMystery and Imagination(1968). Maud was played byLucy FlemingwithRobert Eddisonas Silas.[5]

In 1977 a West German seriesUncle Silaswas produced featuringHannes Messemerin the title role.

The Dark Angel, a further adaptation starringPeter O'Tooleas Silas, premiered on BBC Television in 1989,[6]and was broadcast onPBSin the US on 21 March 1991.[7][8]

In October 2021, principal photography began on an adaptation financed byFís Éireann/Screen Ireland. It is being directed by Lisa Mulcahy, withAgnes O'Caseyas Maud andDavid Wilmotas Silas.[9]It was released in 2023 under the titleLies We Tell.

The BBC has also broadcast radio adaptations of the novel, including:"
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2014,The Lodger,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lodger_(novel),"The story is told from the point of view of Ellen Bunting, a former maid, and her husband and former butler, Mr. Bunting, who together are trying to manage alodging. Struck by bad luck at their first attempt, as anepidemydevelops near where their first lodging is, they decide to try one more time, with their remaining savings. When they are close to giving up on this endeavour, and barely able even to buy food, Mr. Sleuth appears and decides to stay there. He pays a month upfront and asks not to be disturbed while conducting his experiments.

Mrs. Bunting likes Mr. Sleuth and his quiet ways, but becomes increasingly suspicious of him as he arrived on the same day that a gruesome murder happened, and, while he is staying there, several more women are killed by a mysterious man. She notices that the man only leaves after it is dark and his experiments consist of burning his clothes. However, she is horrified at her own suspicions, and does not want to think ill of Mr. Sleuth. She also fears that if her suspicions are true, she and her husband will be blamed for sheltering him, so, despite her growing fear, she lets him stay.

Mr. Bunting, having received some extra money after working as a waiter for an expensive party, invites his daughter from a previous marriage, Daisy, to visit them for a few days during her 18th birthday. That night, while going home, he finds Mr. Sleuth on his way to the lodging. After a brief conversation, he passes Mr. Sleuth to open the lodging's front door and accidentally touches Mr. Sleuth's pocket. The butler becomes suspicious after realizing it was drenched in blood, and even more so when two more bodies are found nearby the next morning.

On the day of Daisy's birthday, both Mr. and Mrs. Bunting leave the house at the same time. When they meet each other and realize they left Daisy alone with Mr. Sleuth, they run back and, arriving there, the girl tells them about the conversation she had with the lodger, during which he asked if he could go toMadame Tussaudswith Daisy and Ellen. While in the museum, they see the Head Commissioner of Police and other officers leaving. Believing he was betrayed by Mrs. Bunting, Mr. Sleuth threatens her and disappears, only for his body to be found five days later, having drowned in a river.

Although it is accepted that gender is an important aspect of Lowndes' work, the views are somewhat divided.[4]Virginia Macdonald, in theTwentieth century crime and mystery writerschapter about Lowndes, notices a pattern in Lowndes' stories of women who are turned from respectable to murderous due to vices or other psychological problems.[8]For Mary Jean DeMarr, the main thematic impulse ofThe Lodgeris Mrs. Bunting's ""willful self-deception"".[9]Scholars Laura Marcus and Joseph Kestner, both responsible for writing ""full-length academic texts on Marie Belloc Lowndes,"" consider the British writer to be ""decidedly feminist.""[4]

According to literature professor Elyssa Warkentin, having the main female character be the one person capable of solving the mystery behind the murders that eluded thousands of officers and detectives, is a ""suggestion that the problem of male violence cannot be solved within the confines of male-dominated systems of knowledge"". For her, the novel gives agency to women in a situation of violence andmisogyny.[4]Marcus also comments, in one of her studies aboutThe Lodger, how Mrs. Bunting is ""more of a detective figure than Joe, the police detective.""[7]: 33

Warkentin, in her analysis, notes that, although the reader sees the perspective of several characters throughout the story, the one that is most prevalent is Mrs. Bunting's, who is also the first of them to realize that the new lodger might be the killer that theScotland Yardis after. Mrs. Bunting is also treated as an agent in the novel, instead of being an object or victim, which Marcus sees as a manifestation of Lowndes' feminism inThe Lodger.[4]

In an analysis of three of Lowndes' works, ""focusing primarily on [...] novels about murderesses"", Ellen Turner comments on how Mr. Sleuth, the murderer, isfeminisedby the author, being described as ""a strange, queer looking figure of a man"". For Turner, this shows that murder is strongly ""associated with the feminine"" in Lowndes' works.[10]: 56-57

When Mr. Sleuth first appears, the Buntings see in him their salvation from financial ruin. After some time, Mrs. Bunting becomes suspicious of her lodger, as she realizes he could be the one behind the murders. Even though she knows this, Mrs. Bunting avoids talking to the police, as she is afraid her association with the murderer could lead to being ostracized by society.[11]Not only that, throughout the novel she shows a constant fear of the police, who, for the Buntings, possess an almost unnatural power.[10]: 60

Even though Mrs. Bunting is portrayed as a ""respectable, nineteenth century woman of her class,"" she is free of anyethical dilemmawhen she chooses to protect Mr. Sleuth from the police.[11]

The Lodgerwas initially published in 1911 as a short story in the last edition ofMcClure's Magazineaccompanied by sketches from Henry Raleigh.[3]: ix; xiiiAfterwards, Marie Belloc Lowndes wrote a novel by the same name, based on the short story, which was published in 1913 in a serialized format in theDaily Telegraph. Later in the same year, it was published byMethuenas a book.[3]: xiii

The Lodgeris considered to be both the first and the best fictional adaptation of the Jack the Ripper story.[11][4]According to Lowndes in one of her memoirs, the book had sold over a million copies after a few decades of its publication.[4]When originally released in the United States, writersErnest HemingwayandGertrude Steinhelped advertise it,[12]with Hemingway callingThe LodgerandThe Chink in the Armour""splendid after-work books, the people credible and the action and the terror never false.""[7]: 23Edmund Pearson, a contemporary who also wrote books based on ""true crimes"", called Lowndes' book ""the best novel about murder written by any living author.""[5]

A review published inThe Observerin 1913 said ""[Belloc Lowndes] brings to the making of a mystery a literary sense and an imagination that puts life into the tale and into the readers."" They commented on the quality of the characters, calling them ""real people"", and also praised the atmosphere that Lowndes managed to create.[13]ANew York Timesreview commented that the book's clue about the murderer is ""nothing more than a clever 'blind'"" to the real mystery to be solved, which ""testifies to the skill of Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes as a writer of mystery stories.""[14]

Anthony Hilfer called it ""[t]he classic novel of guilty bystanders"" in his book,The Crime Novel: A Deviant Genre.[15]: 95Lowndes was later praised for how the story focuses not on the murderer or their targets, but instead on the people affected by them, such as the Bunting family.[11]

The Lodger, which has spawned several adaptations throughout the years, is considered today to be one of Lowndes' most widely known works.[16][11]But, despite the praise she received for the novel, very few academic studies were published about it until a more recent revival.[4][16]

The 1950surban legendThe Hookfollows the plot dynamics of the horror novelThe Lodger.[1]Though the two narratives have little in common, theliterary scholarChristopher Pittard notes that both are built upon a ""threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product ofpostmodernistconsumer culture.""[17]

The first adaptation of Belloc Lowndes novel was asilent moviedirected byAlfred Hitchcock,[18]which was also Hitchcock's first movie released to the general public.[19]: 202It was released in the United Kingdom in 1926 with the titleThe Lodger: A Story of the London Fog,[19]: 202and in the United States in the following year titledThe Case of Jonathan Drew.[20]

While the plot is very similar to the novel, Hitchcock had to change the script to have the Buntings' daughter, Daisy, as the lodger's love interest due to pressure from the studio.[19]: 182Another major change made at the request of the studio was having the lodger, played byIvor Novello, shown as innocent for all the deaths. While Hitchcock had originally planned to maintain the killer's identity a mystery, ""a star of Novello's standing could not end up as a pathological killer."" His character is instead searching for the killer.[19]: 194

In 1932, another movie based on the story, also starring Novello in the main role, was released. Directed byMaurice Elveyand titledThe Phantom Fiendin the United States, it was considered a closer adaptation to the original than that of Hitchcock.[21]In 1944another moviewas released, this time byJohn Brahm. This version differs from the original by having the lodger's victims as actresses instead of sex workers.[22]Hugo Fregonesedirected a 1953 adaptation ofThe LodgercalledMan in the Attic.[23]

The novel was also adapted to the television.Armchair Mystery Theatre, a companion show ofArmchair Theatre, had an episode in its third season called ""The Lodger"", which aired in 1965 in the United Kingdom.[24]In 1967,Wolf Dietrich[de]directed aTV moviein Germany calledDer MieterwithPinkas Braunas the murderer.[18][25]

In 2009 David Ondaatje directed a new adaptation calledThe Lodgerand starringAlfred Molina,Hope DavisandSimon Baker.

In 1940, Hitchcock andHerbert Marshallworked together to create a radio version of Belloc Lowndes' 1913 novel. This was the first episode of a new series calledSuspense, which was created to ""bring 'something new and different to radio'.""[26]Four years later, another episode ofSuspensebased on the book was broadcast, this time withRobert Montgomeryin the main role.[27]Montgomery reprised his performance in 1948, when the series broadcast a one-hour episode based onThe Lodger.[28][29]

In 1946,Ida LupinoandVincent Priceparticipated in aHollywood Star Timeepisode,[30]and in 1947Mystery in the Airbroadcast an episode starringPeter Lorre.[31]

BBC Radio 4released a new version adapted by Stephen Sheridan and produced by David Blount in 2003, which significantly changed the ending of the story.[32]

The novel was also adapted to theopera, with a production composed byPhyllis Tatewhich premiered in 1960.[33]"

She raises him until about the age of six when she is hanged. He is then raised as a ward of aparish, and sent to sea at age twelve, going on journeys toNewfoundland. In 1695, while returning from one of these journeys, he is captured byTurkishpirates and subsequently rescued by Portuguese sailors who carry him toLisbon. After a two-year stay there, he sails forBraziland later theEast Indies. Singleton becomes a thief under the influence of the Portuguese and harbours a desire to kill his master, who refuses to pay him wages and beats him. Nearly hanged for his part in an attemptedmutiny, Singleton, now about seventeen or eighteen, is set ashore with four companions on the coast ofMadagascar. A score of other sailors from the ship join them and together they endeavour to survive on the island, hunting wild animals and trading with the natives. Together they build a canoe and travel in it to the mainland where they decide to pursue a journey throughAfrica, from the coast ofMozambiqueto theGold Coast.

During the hazardous trip Singleton becomes the leader of the group. They enslave about sixty of the natives, one a prince, and procure some buffalo to transport their supplies. They heal the prince and make him commander over the rest. The travellers march through lands teeming withleopards,elephants,crocodiles, andsnakesand cross a great desert. The marchers meet an English merchant who has been living with the natives and who persuades Singleton and his companions to stop awhile in order to dig forgold. Having loaded themselves down with gold andelephant tusks, the adventurers finally reach a Dutch settlement, where they divide thespoilsand immediately go their separate ways.

Once Singleton has spent his fortune in England, he sets out again, this time for theWest Indieswhere he quickly takes to piracy. Singleton's abilities bring him high command, although his piratical activities encourage the growth of a callousness so pervasive that at times it leads to cruelty. There are chases andsea battlesin which Singleton proves himself an able, courageous, and imaginative leader. From the Indies the scene shifts to the East African coast and Madagascar where the pirates continue toplunderand sail restlessly in search of new conquests. This lust fornoveltytakes Singleton and his men into thePacificas far as thePhilippines, before returning to theIndian OceanandCeylon.

William, aQuakersurgeon, outwits a Ceylonese King and rescues a Dutch slave. William displays further resourcefulness by succeeding intradenegotiations with English merchants inIndia. He serves Singleton loyally and bravely as a kind ofman Friday: he is, moreover, aChristian humanistand healer who ultimately persuades his captain that a life of piracy leads nowhere. When Singleton contemplates suicide in the throes ofrepentance, William convinces him thatsuicideis the ""Devil's Notion"" and therefore must be ignored.

When they return to England, disguised asArmenians, they make the decision to stay together for the rest of their lives. Singleton marries William's sister, awidow, and the story ends on a note of domestic peace.[7][8]"

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75157,The Bishop murder case,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bishop_Murder_Case,"The story involves a series of murders taking place in a wealthy neighborhood ofNew York City. The first murder, of a Mr. Joseph Cochrane Robin, who is found pierced by an arrow, is accompanied by a note signed ""The Bishop"", with an extract from thenursery rhyme, ""Who Killed Cock Robin"".  This crime takes place at the home of an elderly physicist with a beautiful young ward and a private archery range.  District Attorney Markham finds the circumstances so unusual that he asks his friend Philo Vance to advise upon the psychological aspects of the crime.  Further murders connected with the physicist's family and neighbours are accompanied with similar extracts fromMother Goose, such as the case of Johnny Sprigg, ""who was shot through the middle of his wig, wig, wig.""  Midway through the book, an elderly woman confesses to the crimes, but this possibility is discounted by the police for physical reasons and by Philo Vance for psychological ones.  Vance and the police luckily discover the kidnapping and confinement of a little Miss Moffatt before the child suffocates in the closet in which she has been locked.  Vance finally realizes the significance of one character's pointed reference toThe Pretenders, a play written byHenrik Ibsen. Vance arranges a spectacular finale in which the criminal is poisoned by a glass of liqueur which that person prepared for another suspect.

Modern interest in this book stems at least partly from its role as a precursor of other books with a similar design, such that the underlying circumstances of a series of murders appear to be related to an external source, such as, in this instance, Mother Goose stories.  Many other laterGolden Agemystery novels are constructed around a formal scheme.Agatha Christieused this motif inTen Little Indiansand a number of other novels constructed around the basis of a nursery rhyme (Hickory Dickory Dock,One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, etc.), or another linking device like the alphabet (The A.B.C. Murders).

""Philo Vance is more pedantic than ever and talks absolute rot except for passages quoted from encyclopedias about modern physics and math.  A young scientist is 'framed' for a series of apparently meaningless killings and the solution is pulled out of a hat after Vance has finished lecturing.""[1]

""The murderer in this story has an uncommon sense of humor and of sportsmanship.  In a non-stop trail of successive murders, a note is discovered at each scene.  Each note contains a nursery rhyme with a false clue and is signed ""The Bishop.""  Philo Vance finally puts a stop to the fun, which had included a generous sprinkling of archery, chess and astronomy, mixed with poison and bloodshed.""[2]

A film starringBasil Rathbonewas made ofThe Bishop Murder Case[3]in 1930.  The film was an early ""talkie"" and lacks a music soundtrack.

Some elements from the mystery's plot were referenced inDario Argento'sgiallocomeback movie,Sleepless(calledNon ho sonnoin Italy), which featured killings referencing a nursery rhyme."

Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/363,The Oakdale Affair,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oakdale_Affair,"In the home of Jonas Prim, president of an Oakdale bank, a thief makes off with a servant's clothing and valuables belonging to Prim's daughter Abigail. Abigail is thought to be absent visiting Sam Benham, whom her parents want her to marry. Escaping, the thief later encounters a group of hobos and is taken for one of them, the Oskaloosa Kid. Two of the hobos attempt to murder the newcomer for the loot, who shoots at one and flees.

Meanwhile, the Prims discover the theft and learn that Abigail never arrived at Benham's. The incidents are assumed to be connected to other crimes, the assault and robbery of John Baggs and the murder of Reginald Paynter, who had been seen with two men and a girl. The local paper speculates Abigail might have been involved with Paynter's murder. Mr. Prim hires a private eye.

The thief encounters another vagrant, Bridge, and the two take refuge from a storm in the deserted Squibb house, site of an old murder. Nearby, a shot is heard from a passing car, from which a woman is thrown. The two take the unconscious woman into the house. There they discover a dead body and hear something in the cellar dragging a chain. They lock themselves in one of the rooms. The woman, reviving, reveals herself as the girl with Paynter. The other men in the car were Terry, the driver, and the Oskaloosa Kid. She says the Kid murdered Paynter and afterwards threw her from the car and shot at her when she wouldn't keep quiet.

The two hobos pursuing the thief enter the house, find the body, and encounter the thing in the cellar. Bridge lets them in the room to save them from the thing, at which the thief shoots. The thing retreats. Later, as the storm dies down, they again hear its approach, and a woman's shriek. When all is silent they emerge to find the dead man gone. The hobos threaten to turn the thief in for Paynter's murder unless they are given a share of the loot. Bridge, with the thief's gun, forces them to leave without it. Afterwards the thief goes to a nearby farmhouse of the Case family to buy food and brags to the Cases' son Willie about the exploits of the Oskaloosa Kid. After the thief's departure the Cases hear about the Baggs, Paynter and Prim mysteries from the local postman.

A car containing Burton, a private detective, and two others pulls up to the Squibb house, and Bridge, the thief and the woman flee into the woods. Burton goes to the Case farm and questions the family, after which Willie disappears. The detective apprehends the hobos Bridge had driven from the Squibb house and gets their story, after which he arrests them as material witnesses. He himself vanishes for a few minutes, supposedly in search of a notebook he says he lost; actually he has found the loot from the Baggs robbery, implicating his captives in that crime.

In the woods Bridge and his companions come across a cabin where Giova, a gypsy girl, is digging a grave. Willie also turns up. Bridge and Giova exchange stories. He tells her he tracked her and the thing from the Squibb place; the thing is now revealed as her pet bear Beppo. She tells him the body from the house which she is burying is that of her father, a villainous drunk who died of a fit. Bridge suggests they join forces. His group helps her bury the body, and she disguises them as gypsies. Meanwhile, Willie, whom the thief has tried to bribe into silence, steals off and calls Burton.

Burton, Jonas Prim and a posse join Willie and are led to the cabin while the two hobos in Burton's custody are sent to jail. Bridge's party is not found, but the gypsy's body is dug up. Willie testifies on the gypsy's death at the inquest. Later that night, by chance, he spies the fugitives hiding in an old mill and again goes to inform Burton. But the group of hobos of whom Burton's captives were members has also learned their whereabouts, and plots to murder Bridge and the thief for the latter's loot and return the girl, whom they take for Abigail, to Prim for the reward. The gang duly attack them, but chaos ensues when Beppo the bear comes to their defense. Burton's posse arrives and intervenes; the bear is killed and all the combatants taken captive. Bridge and the thief are jailed and endangered by a lynch mob. Burton questions the woman, now identified as Hettie Penning. She tells him how Paynter died at the hands of the Oskaloosa Kid, and that the thief is not the Kid. Her story is confirmed when it is learned that the real Kid has turned up, fatally injured from crashing the car, and has confessed to murdering Paynter and shooting Hettie.

Burton and Prim go to the jail, where they find the mob about to lynch Bridge and the thief, who they believe have robbed and killed Abigail Prim, and Paynter as well. Bridge, who has deduced the truth about his companion, reveals that the ""thief""isAbigail, and the possessions she ""stole"" are her own property. Burton and Prim intervene and free the prisoners, whose secrets are now revealed. Abigail had run away so she would not have to marry Sam Benham. Bridge too is a runaway, having abandoned his own wealthy family to ride the rails. Burton has long been searching for him on commission from his father. In the end all is resolved satisfactorily Hettie takes on Giova as her maid, and Bridge and Abigail realize they have fallen in love with each other, which they seal with a kiss. In light of what Burton has revealed about Bridge, the prospects for their romance appear bright.

Frank and Joe raced toward the scene and actually saw the stolen car. Suddenly, a big red produce truck came right into the middle of the road. The boys had no choice but to slam on their brakes. They ended up crashing into a fence and were dazed but uninjured. The driver came out of the truck and apologized. Frank remarks that ""Something seems fishy about that guy."". They both return home that night trying not to let their mother see their cuts and bruises.

The next morning a friend of the Hardys, Jack Dodd, calls and tells the Hardys to come quickly. The police were looking for a suspect who had stolen a car. The police thought they found their man. They found Jack Dodd's fishing rod in the trunk of one of the stolen cars. Jack insisted that he had not put it there and that he was being framed. The cops handcuffed Jack and his father and took them down to headquarters. Later that night Chief Collig came to the Hardys' home telling them that the Dodds had taken off in their station wagon. A relative of the Dodds is trying to find a solution to an old mystery an ancestor had in the Bayport area.

While riding theirmotorcyclesalong the Shore Road the Hardy boys, along with their palChet Morton, meet a local fisherman who has just had his car stolen.  The three boys give chase, but are delayed due to an accident with a horse-drawn haywagon.  Further down the road they find their chum, Jack Dodd, and his father being questioned by the police because a stolen car was found in their yard with Jack's fishing rod in the back seat.  The Hardy boys resolve to solve the case and clear their friend's name.

While investigating the case the Hardy boys identify suspects including a band of tramps camping on the beach, a man named Gus Montrose who used to work for Mr. Dodd, and a group of fishermen sneaking around the woods at night.

The Hardy boys, with their fatherFenton Hardy, the Bayport Police force,State Troopersand a number of other curious people all attempt to investigate/find the car thefts; however, everyone involved is stumped because the cars seem to disappear without a trace and are not spotted leaving either end of the Shore Road area.  Because of this the Hardy boys believe that the cars are still in the area, but well hidden, so they devise a plan to trap the car thieves.  After purchasing a nice looking roadster the Hardy boys park the car along the Shore Road and hide in a large locker on the back.  During the first night the car does get some troubles to get started and thief leaves it but on the next night it is stolen, with the boys in the locker, and driven to the thieves’ secret hideout where the boys are discovered.  After some excitement (involving guns), the Hardy boys manage to escape and alert the police who surround the area and arrest all of the thieves (including Gus Montrose) and recover the stolen vehicles."
Crime_Mystery,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4223,The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_a_Hansom_Cab,"The Mystery of a Hansom Cabtakes place inMelbourne, Australia, and involves an investigation into ahomicide, after a corpse is discovered in the early hours, in ahansom cab. Melbourne plays a significant role in the plot and, as the author describes, ""Over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall.""[13]The killer's identity is not as significant a revelation in the story as are the roles of the influential and secretive Frettlby family, and their secret: they have a daughter living on the streets, and the woman everyone assumes is their daughter is illegitimate. The class divide between Melbourne's wealthy and less fortunate is addressed throughout the plot.[14]

The protagonist in the novel is a policeman named Detective Gorby, who is given the task of solving the murder.[15]As Hume describes the character's investigative skills, ""He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once.""[15]The author commented in a later introduction, ""All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights inLittle Bourke Street, gathering material"".[2]At this time, the street was notorious as a place frequented by prostitutes and criminals.[16]

The Mystery of a Hansom Cabwas first published in Melbourne in 1886 and in Britain in 1887[2](the author self-published the first edition)[1][5]and in the United States in 1888, byGeorge Munro.[17]Hume wrote an introduction to a revised edition published in 1898,[2]and later publications have included those by the publishers Arno in 1976, and by Dover in 1982,[18][19]and a new Australian edition with an introduction by Simon Caterson, in 1999 by The Text Publishing Company, which has been reprinted several times.[20]

""A Concise History of Australia"" notes that the book became an international bestseller.[13]A Companion to Australian Literature since 1900notedThe Mystery of a Hansom Cabprovided Australia with its first international bestseller.[1]andVintage Mystery and Detective Storiescharacterized the book as the best-selling detective novel of the 19th century.[5]In Australia, the book sold 25,000 copies in its first print run, and 100,000 copies in its first two print runs.[3][21]In Britain, in its first six months after publication, 300,000 copies were sold,[2][14]and, in 1888, sales continued in thousands in Britain each week.[2][14]According toA Gregarious Culture(2001), ""sales ofThe Mystery of a Hansom Cab, published in 1886, would reach astronomical figures"".Franklin, Roe & Bettison (2001)Over 500,000 copies were sold in Britain, by the publishing companyJarrold.[15]In the United States, an additional 500,000 copies were sold.[5]

The author did not benefit from the sales of the work, as he had sold his rights to it for£50.[15]A Gregarious Cultureidentifies ""the only known [complete] copy of the first edition"" of the book as ""a treasure"" of the Mitchell Library atState Library of New South Wales.[6]Illustrated London Newsreported in 1888 on the popularity of the book, ""Persons were found everywhere eagerly devouring the realistic sensational tale of Melbourne social life. Whether travelling by road, rail or river the unpretending little volume was ever present in some companion's or stranger's hands.""[2][14]The book outsold the worldwide 1887 publication of theSherlock HolmesnovelA Study in ScarletbyArthur Conan Doyle.[1]

A parody edition, titledThe Mystery of a Wheelbarrow(1888), is attributed to a W. Humer Ferguson.[6][22]The same year, it was adapted for the stage byArthur Law.[23]

The Mystery of a Hansom Cab(1911) is a film produced by Amalgamated Pictures, an Australian adaptation of the book.[8][24]

In 1915, the book was again adapted into a film with screenplay byEliot Stannard.[7]Directed by Harold Weston, the film starred the actorsMilton Rosmer, Fay Temple, A. V. Bramble, James Dale and Arthur Walcott.[25][7][26]

A remake of the 1911 version of the film was produced in 1925, in Australia.[8]Made by Pyramid Pictures,The Mystery of a Hansom Cabcast included Arthur Shirley, Grace Glover,Godfrey Cass, Cora Warner and Isa Crossley.[8][27]

The Mystery of a Hansom Cabwas a 1935 reissue of the 1925 Australian silent film. It was released byPathescope.[28]

Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: ""A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in africassee, or aragout.""[1]

Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay whichlampoonthe then-influentialWilliam Pettyand thesocial engineeringpopular among followers ofFrancis Bacon. These lampoons includeappealing to the authorityof ""a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London"" and ""the famousPsalmanazar, a native of the islandFormosa"" (who had already confessed to not being from Formosa in 1706).

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting byparalipsis:

George Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target inA Modest Proposalwas not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.[3]Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.[4]A memorable example of these sorts of schemes ""involved the idea of running the poor through ajoint-stock company"".[4]In response, Swift'sModest Proposalwas ""a burlesque of projects concerning the poor""[5]that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

Ian McBride argues that the point ofA Modest Proposalwas to ""find a suitably decisive means of dehumanizing the settlers who had failed so comprehensively to meet their social responsibilities.""[6]A Modest Proposalalso targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who ""regard people as commodities"".[7]In the piece, Swift adopts the ""technique of a political arithmetician""[8]to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy.Edmund Wilsonargues that statistically ""the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated toMarx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population"".[8]Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that ""springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake"".[9]

Author Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a ""trap""[10]to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, ""details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty"" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.[11]Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create ""two opposing points of view"" that ""alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.""[11]

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses ""the vocabulary of animal husbandry""[12]to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn ""people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound"".[12]

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetoricianQuintilian).[13]The contrast between the ""careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme"" and ""the ridiculousness of the proposal"" create a situation in which the reader has ""to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan"".[13]

Scholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wroteA Modest Proposal.

James William Johnson argues thatA Modest Proposalwas largely influenced and inspired byTertullian'sApology: a satirical attack against earlyRoman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.[14]Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the worksA Modest ProposalandApology.[15]In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that ""human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human"".[14]Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.[14]In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic ""justification by ownership"" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the mistreatment of the poor in Ireland.[16]

It has also been argued thatA Modest Proposalwas, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essayThe Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Childrenby Swift's rivalDaniel Defoe.[17]

Bernard Mandeville'sModest Defence of Publick Stewsasked to introduce public and state-controlledbordellos. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and—while not being a completely satirical text—has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.[18][19]Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous forThe Fable of the Beesand deliberations on private vices and public benefits.

John Lockecommented: ""Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power,that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them: If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto"". (First Treatise, sec. 59).

Robert Phiddian's article ""Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal"" focuses on two aspects ofA Modest Proposal: the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that ""there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody"".[20]

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of ""Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet"", argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argued that an insufficient number of critics have taken the time to focus directly on mercantilism and theories of labour inGeorgian eraBritain. ""If one regards theModest Proposalsimply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact"".[21]

At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that ""people are the riches of the nation"", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.[22]Furthermore, ""in themercantilistview no child was too young to go into industry"". In those times, the ""somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity"".[20]

Louis A. Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to ""become a source of wealth to the nation"" or else they ""must turn to begging and thievery"".[23]This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, ""Swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism.""[24]

Landa presents Swift'sA Modest Proposalas a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that ""people are the riches of a nation"".[23]Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.[24]The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.[24]Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.[24]Landa argued that Swift was putting the onus ""on England of vitiating the working of natural economic law in Ireland"" by denying Irishmen ""the same natural rights common to the rest of mankind.""[24]

Swift's essay created a backlash within Georgian society after its publication. The work was aimed at the elite, and they responded in turn. Several prominent members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work.Lord Bathurst's letter (12 February 1729–30) intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3178,The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today,"The novel concerns the efforts of a poor rural family to become affluent by selling in a timely manner the 75,000 acres (300 km2) ofunimprovedland acquired by their patriarch, Silas ""Si"" Hawkins. After several adventures inTennessee, the family fails to sell the land and Si Hawkins dies. The rest of the Hawkins story line focuses on their beautiful, adopted daughter Laura. In the early 1870s, she travels toWashington, D.C.to become alobbyist. With a senator's help, she enters society and attempts to persuadecongressmento require the federal government to purchase the land.

A parallel story written by Warner concerns two young upperclass men, Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly, who seek their fortunes in land in a novel way. They make a journey with a group intent onsurveyingland in Tennessee in order to acquire it forspeculation. Philip is good-natured but plodding. He is in love with Ruth Bolton, an aspiring physician andfeminist. Henry is a born salesman, charming but superficial.

The Hawkins sections, including several humorous sketches, were written by Twain. Examples are the steamboat race that leads to a wreck (Chapter IV) and Laura's toying with a clerk in a Washington bookstore (Chapter XXXVI). Notable too is the comic presence throughout the book of the eternally optimistic and eternally broke Colonel Beriah Sellers, aMicawber-like character. The character was named Escol Sellers in the first edition and changed to Beriah when an actualGeorge Escol Sellersof Philadelphia objected. A real Beriah Sellers then turned up, causing Twain to use the name Mulberry Sellers inThe American Claimant. The Sellers character was modeled after James Lampton, Twain's maternal cousin, and the land-purchase plot parallels Twain's father's purchase of a Tennessee parcel whose prospective sale, Twain wrote in his autobiography ""kept us hoping and hoping, during 40 years, and forsook us at last.""[1]

The main action of the story takes place in Washington, D.C., and satirizes the greed and corruption of the governing class. Twain also satirizes the social pretensions of thenewly rich. Laura's Washington visitors include ""Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay)"", the wife of ""a wealthy Frenchman fromCork"", indicating the O'Reilly family has altered their last name to hide their Irish origins.

In the end, Laura fails to convince Congress to purchase the Hawkins land. She kills her married lover but is found not guilty of the crime, with the help of a sympathetic jury and a clever lawyer. However, after a failed attempt to pursue a career on the lecture circuit, her spirit is broken, and she dies regretting her fall from innocence. Washington Hawkins, the eldest son, who has drifted through life on his father's early promise that he would be ""one of the richest men in the world"", finally gives up the family's ownership of the still-unimproved land parcel when he cannot afford to pay its $180 of taxes. He also appears ready to overcome his passivity: ""The spell is broken, the life-long curse is ended!"" Philip, drawing upon his engineering skills, discovers coal on Mr. Bolton's land, wins Ruth Bolton's heart and appears destined to enjoy a prosperous and conventionally happy marriage. Henry and Sellers, presumably, will continue to live daily by their wits while others pay their bills.

The theme of the novel is that the lust for getting rich, powerful and famous through land speculation pervades society, illustrated by the Hawkinses as well as Ruth's well-educated father, who nevertheless cannot resist becoming enmeshed in self-evidently dubious money-making schemes.

The book does not touch upon other themes now associated with the ""Gilded Age"", such as industrialization, monopolies, and the corruption of urbanpolitical machines.

Charles Dudley Warner, a writer and editor, was a neighbor and good friend of Mark Twain in Hartford, Connecticut. According to Twain's biographer,Albert Bigelow Paine, their wives challenged Twain and Warner at dinner to write a better novel than what they were used to reading. Twain wrote the first 11 chapters, followed by 12 chapters written by Warner. Most of the remaining chapters were also written by only one of them, but the concluding chapters were attributed to joint authorship. The entire novel was completed between February and April 1873.

Contemporary critics, while praising its humor and satire, did not consider the collaboration a success because the independent stories written by each author did not mesh well. A review published in 1874 compared the novel to a badly mixed salad dressing, in which ""the ingredients are capital, the use of them faulty.""[2]

The termGilded Age, commonly given to the era, comes from the title of this book. Twain and Warner got the name fromWilliam Shakespeare'sKing John(1595): ""To gild refined gold, to paint the lily... is wasteful and ridiculous excess."" (Act IV, scene 2)Gildinggold, which would be to put gold on top of gold, is excessive and wasteful, characteristics of the age Twain and Warner wrote about in their novel. Another interpretation of the title, of course, is the contrast between an ideal ""Golden Age"" and a less worthy ""Gilded Age"", as gilding is only a thin layer of gold over baser metal, so the title now takes on a pejorative meaning as to the novel's time, events and people.

Playwright and screenwriterDavid Mamet, speaking of his bookBambi Meets Godzilla: On the Nature, Purpose and Practice of the Movie Business, usedThe Gilded Ageas a metaphor for Hollywood. On an NPR call-in show, Mamet drew comparisons between the Hawkins family's 40-year quest to win funding for a dam in their hometown and the plight of a young filmmaker trying to sell a script in the unforgiving studio system.[3]"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28488,"Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartuffe,"Orgon's family is up in arms because Orgon and his mother have fallen under the influence of Tartuffe, a pious fraud (and a vagrant prior to Orgon's help).  Tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority, and Orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him.

Tartuffe's antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends; they detest him. Orgon raises the stakes when he announces that Tartuffe will marry Orgon's daughter Mariane (who is already engaged to Valère).  Mariane becomes very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply Tartuffe has embedded himself into the family.

In an effort to show Orgon how awful Tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap Tartuffe into confessing to Elmire (Orgon's wife) his desire for her. As a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, Orgon will throw Tartuffe out of the house. Indeed, Tartuffe does try to seduce Elmire, but their interview is interrupted when Orgon's son Damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce Tartuffe.

Tartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well.  When Orgon enters the room and Damis triumphantly tells him what happened, Tartuffe usesreverse psychologyand accuses himself of being the worst sinner:

Orgon is convinced that Damis was lying and banishes him from the house. Tartuffe even convinces Orgon to order that, to teach Damis a lesson, Tartuffe should be around Elmire more than ever. As a gift to Tartuffe and further punishment to Damis and the rest of his family, Orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to Tartuffe.

In a later scene, Elmire challenges Orgon to be witness to a meeting between her and Tartuffe. Orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that Elmire is wrong. He overhears Elmire resisting Tartuffe's very forward advances. When Tartuffe has incriminated himself definitively and is dangerously close to violating Elmire, Orgon comes out from under the table and orders Tartuffe out of his house. The wily guest means to stay, and Tartuffe finally shows his hand. It turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, Orgon had admitted to Tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). Tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells Orgon that he (Orgon) will be the one to leave. Tartuffe takes his temporary leave. Orgon's family tries to decide what to do. Very soon, Monsieur Loyal shows up with a message from Tartuffe and the court itself; they must exit the house because it now belongs to Tartuffe. Dorine makes fun of Monsieur Loyal's name, mocking his fake loyalty. Even Madame Pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about Tartuffe even in the face of her son's actually witnessing it, has become convinced of Tartuffe's duplicity.

No sooner does Monsieur Loyal leave than Valère rushes in with the news that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that Orgon is about to be arrested. Before Orgon can flee, Tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise, the officer arrests him instead. The officer explains that the enlightened KingLouis XIV—who is not mentioned by name—has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by Tartuffe's treachery towards Orgon, has ordered Tartuffe's arrest instead.

It is revealed that Tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. As a reward for Orgon's previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave Tartuffe possession of Orgon's house and possessions. The entire family is thankful that it has escaped the mortification of both Orgon's potential disgrace and their dispossession.

The drama ends well, and Orgon announces the upcoming wedding of Valère and Mariane. The surprisetwist ending, in which everything is set right by the unexpected benevolent intervention of the heretofore unseen king, is considered a notable modern-day example of the classical theatrical plot devicedeus ex machina.

ThoughTartuffewas received well by the public and even by Louis XIV, it immediately sparked conflict amongst many different groups who were offended by the play's portrayal of someone who was outwardly pious but fundamentally mercenary, lecherous, and deceitful; and who uses their profession of piety to prey on others. The factions opposed to Molière's work included part of the hierarchy of theFrench Roman Catholic Church, members of upper-class French society, and the illegal underground organization called theCompagnie du Saint-Sacrement.Tartuffe's popularity was cut short when thearchbishop of ParisPéréfixeissued an edict threatening excommunication for anyone who watched, performed in, or read the play. Molière attempted to assuage church officials by rewriting his play to seem more secular and less critical of religion, but the archbishop and other leading officials would not budge. The revised, second version of the play was calledL'Imposteurand had a main character named Panulphe instead of Tartuffe, the only performance of which occurred in the Palais-Royal theatre on 5 August 1667. Immediately the following day, on 6 August, as the king was away from Paris,Guillaume de Lamoignon, first president of theParis Parlement, censored public performances.[5]

Even throughout Molière's conflict with the church, Louis XIV continued to support the playwright; it is possible that without the King's support, Molière might have beenexcommunicated. Although public performances of the play were banned, private performances for the Frencharistocracydid occur.[6]In 1669, after Molière's detractors lost much of their influence, he was finally allowed to perform the final version of his play. However, due to all thecontroversysurroundingTartuffe, Molière mostly refrained from writing such incisive plays as this one again.[7]

An ally of Molière (believed by Robert McBride to beFrançois de La Mothe Le Vayer, but a hotly-debated point)[8][9]responded to criticism ofTartuffein 1667 with aLettre sur la comédie de l'Imposteur. The anonymous author sought to defend the play[a]to the public by describing the plot in detail and then rebutting two common arguments made for why the play was banned. The first being that theatrical works should not discuss religion at all; the second being that Tartuffe's actions on stage, followed by his pious speech, would make the audience think that they were to act as Tartuffe did. This section of letter contradicts the latter by describing how Tartuffe's actions are worthy ofridicule, in essence comic, and therefore by no means an endorsement.[citation needed]

Centuries later, when thesatiricalanticlericalmagazineLa Calottestarted publication in 1906, its first editorial asserted thatLaughter is the only weapon feared by the soldiers of Tartuffe; the new magazine proposed to effectively deploy that weapon, with articles and cartoons mercilessly lampooning the Catholic Church and its clergy.[11][12][13]

The original version of the play was in three acts and was first staged on 12 May 1664 at thePalace of Versailles' Cour de Marbre[14]as part offestivitiesknown asLes Plaisirs de l'île enchantée. Because of the attacks on the play and the ban that was placed on it, this version was never published, and no text has survived, giving rise to much speculation as to whether it was a work in progress or a finished piece. Many writers believe it consisted of the first three acts of the final version, whileJohn Cairncrosshas proposed that acts 1, 3, and 4 were performed.[15]Although the original version could not be played publicly, it could be given privately,[15]and it was seen on 25 September 1664 inVillers-Cotterêts, for Louis' brotherPhilippe I, Duke of Orléans, akaMonsieurand 29 November 1664 at theChâteau du Raincy, for the veteran of theFronde,Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti.[16]

The second version,L'Imposteur, was in five acts and performed only once, on 5 August 1667 in theThéâtre du Palais-Royal. On 11 August, before any additional performances, theArchbishop of ParisPéréfixe banned this version also. The largely-final, revised third version in five acts, under the titleTartuffe, ou L'Imposteur, appeared on 5 February 1669 at the Palais-Royal theatre and was highly successful.[15]This version was published[17]and is the one that is generally performed today.[15]

Since Molière's time,Tartuffehas stayed on the repertoire of theComédie-Française, where it is its most performed play.[18]

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9070,The Imaginary Invalid,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imaginary_Invalid,"The play opens with Argan, a severehypochondriac, going through the bill from his apothecary (the pharmacist) item by item. He pays out only about half of what is on the bill. That done, he calls for his maid, Toinette. When she fails to appear immediately he shouts and calls her names until she arrives. Toinette is not interested in putting up with Argan's temper, so she mocks his rage. Eventually he gives up trying to scold her and asks her to call in his daughter, Angelique. Angelique is ready to talk to him, but Argan must leave the room for a short while (presumably the result of an ""injection"" [i.e., enema] he's just had).

While he is out, Angelique takes the opportunity to talk to Toinette. We quickly find out that she has been talking almost non-stop about the qualities of a young man named Cléante since she met him at a play six days ago. She expects Cléante to ask her father if he can marry her, within a few days.

Argan returns and expects to surprise his daughter when he tells her that someone has asked to marry her. He is shocked to find that she not only knows about it, but could not be happier. Unfortunately, Angelique thinks he's been talking about Cléante, while her father has promised his daughter to Thomas Diafoirus, the son of a respectedParisdoctor who is soon to be made a doctor himself.

Toinette asks him why, with all his money, Argan would want a doctor for a son-in-law. He replies that since he is always ill, he thought it would be a good idea to have a doctor in the family. Then he could have Thomas Diafoirus' services as doctor all the time, not to mention the services of his father and his uncle for free. Toinette will not take his hypochondria seriously and tells him that she knows Angelique will never agree to that marriage. More than that, Toinette downright forbids the union to happen. This is amazing gall for a servant, and Argan becomes so incensed that he chases Toinette around the room threatening to kill her. Finally he stops, exhausted, and claims he is dying.

Hearing the disturbance, Argan's second wife Béline runs in. She soothes Argan, talking to him as one would to a child throwing a temper tantrum. Once his new wife has calmed him, Argan asks if she has contacted a notary; he intends to change his will to include (and heavily favour) Béline. She dramatically begs him not to think of such things, but just happens to have the notary to hand. Béline repeatedly claims that she doesn't care about the money, but double-checks the amounts all the same. The notary warns Argan that he can't leave his wife anything, but instructs him on several devious and underhanded methods whereby Béline could get all the money.

Meanwhile, outside the study, Toinette and Angelique have a chance to talk in private. Toinette warns Angelique that her stepmother is plotting to get her inheritance, but Angelique does not care, so long as she is allowed to marry as she wishes. She begs Toinette to help her foil her stepmother and father's plans, a proposition to which Toinette is only too delighted to agree. She also endeavors to find a way to tell Cléante of the intended marriage.

Cléante shows up in disguise at the door, surprising Toinette. He has come pretending to be a substitute for Angelique's music teacher so he can talk to her in private. However, when Argan learns of the ""music master's"" arrival, he decides that he wants to watch the music lesson, spoiling everyone's plans. When Angelique comes in, she is shocked to find Cléante there, but manages to cover her reaction. Then Argan invites Cléante to stay as a guest as Angelique is introduced to her fiancé, Thomas Diafoirus.

When Mr. Diafoirus and his son Thomas enter, Mr. Diafoirus tells Thomas to begin. Thomas asks if he should start with Argan and, once his father tells him to, he greets Argan with a florid prepared speech. Once finished, he asks his father if that was satisfactory and if he should continue. He has a fancy prepared speech ready for every member of the family.

Everyone has a seat and Argan praises Thomas. Mr. Diafoirus says that he is very pleased with his son. He says that as a child he was never very bright or exciting and he never has had any wit or liveliness, but he has sound judgement. What Mr. Diafoirus is most happy about in his son, though, is that he blindly adheres to the ancient medical beliefs and refuses to believe the new modern ideas like ""circulation of the blood.""

Argan asks if Thomas is to become a doctor for the rich at court. Mr. Diafoirus says he much prefers to treat the common people. He adds that with ordinary people he is less accountable to anybody and, as long as procedure is followed, there is no need to worry so much about the results; the rich are much more difficult since they actually seem to expect to be cured.

Argan then tells Cléante to help Angelique sing a song for the party. Cléante gives her a scroll of music with no words and tells everyone that it is a short piece from an improvised opera. Cléante then sings his love and his questions to Angelique in the guise of this opera. She answers him in the same form, telling him that she really loves him and despises the man her father wants her to marry. Their song continues until Argan stops it, thinking it dreadfully inappropriate. He sends Cléante away.

Argan tells Angelique to pledge herself to Thomas, but she refuses. She suggests that they ought to get to know each other first. Argan, however, disagrees. He says that there will be plenty of time for getting to know each other once they are married. As for Thomas, it is enough for him that his father has instructed him to be in love with her. Angelique tries to argue the point with him, but the arguing proves useless.

Argan gets angry with Angelique's willfulness and everyone's failure to pay attention to him during the fight. He tells Angelique that she has four days to decide. Either she marries Thomas, or she goes into a convent.

Angelique runs out and Béline decides to go to town for a while. Argan is left with the two doctors and begs them to examine him. It is very obvious they do not know what they are doing. However, they make up lies which are good enough to convince Argan the hypochondriac.

On her way out, Béline stops to tell Argan that she saw Angelique talking with a young man who ran away as soon as they were spotted. She tells him that his youngest daughter, Louison, saw everything. Argan calls Louison to him for an interrogation. After much coaxing and Louison faking her own death, she tells him that the man claiming to be Angelique's music teacher came to her window and told her over and over how he loved her.

Argan's brother, Beralde, who is a lawyer, comes to visit him. He is not convinced by Argan's claims about how sick he is. Beralde tells his brother that he has a match for Angelique. At the mention of his daughter's name, Argan flies into a rage and Beralde calms him by telling him about a dance troupe that has come to amuse him. There is a dance interlude as Gypsies dance and sing about the joys of young love and the pain when it proves false.

Now that they have both enjoyed the interlude, Beralde wants to have a chat with his brother, but Argan insists he must take a short walk first (he's had another ""injection""). Once Argan is gone, Toinette begs Beralde not to give up on helping his niece. He says that he will do everything he can. Toinette hints that she has a plan herself, but cannot tell what it is because her master has returned.

Now that Argan has returned, Beralde first asks his brother why he would want to send his daughter to a convent. Beralde points out that sending them to a convent was Béline's idea and suggests that she might want the children out of the way for her own reasons, but Argan gets angry and leaps to her defense. Then Beralde asks Argan why he would want to marry his daughter to a doctor so unsuited for her. Argan says that if the doctor is good enough for him, he is good enough for Angelique. Beralde wants to hear no more of this. He points out to Argan that he (Argan) is one of the healthiest people he (Beralde) knows and that Argan's infatuation with doctors and apothecaries is bad for him and everyone else. The doctors, he says, know nothing about the workings of the human body and therefore can do nothing to cure it. The doctors are only educated enough to give fancy Latin names to the things they do not comprehend. They will kill their patients with the best of intentions, but they will still be dead. Beralde believes that all one need do is rest and let nature take its course.

Mr. Fleurant, the apothecary and Purgon's assistant, comes in with a new remedy for Argan. Beralde asks Argan not to take the remedy and to put it off until tomorrow, but this makes Fleurant very angry and he storms off to tell Dr. Purgon about this interference. Beralde tries once again to get his brother to give up his addiction to doctors, but Argan claims to be too sick. Just then Mr. Purgon enters in a furious temper, having been told that his cure was sent back, and rages at Argan. He refuses to treat Argan any more and says that within a few days Argan will go from one horrible disease to another and finally die. With that, he storms out.

Left with Beralde again, Argan cries and says that he can already feel his system shutting down, just as Mr. Purgon had told him. Beralde thinks he is crazy and tells him so, but Argan won't listen. He is sure that he is already dying. Toinette comes in and says that a new doctor has arrived who wants to treat Argan. She doesn't know who the man is, but says that he looks exactly like her. Argan is desperate and consents to see him.

Toinette comes in dressed as a doctor and claims to be one of the world's greatest doctors who has come to see Argan, one of the world's most illustrious patients. She tells Argan that all of his previous doctors were idiots who have totally misdiagnosed him. Argan tells him everything that has been prescribed, and Toinette (as the doctor) contradicts every one, saying his doctors were ignorant quacks. She goes on to make him realize that not everything doctors tell him is true; she blames his one arm for taking up all the nutrients, so he should have it amputated so as to make his other arm stronger. She also says that one of his eyes is taking up all the nutrients that go to it, so if he has it removed, his remaining eye will see much better. After spouting more of this medical nonsense, the ""doctor"" leaves and Toinette comes back on as herself, supposedly outraged that the departing ""doctor"" has been trying to take liberties with her (wanting to ""take [her] pulse"").

Beralde then tries to convince his brother that since he has already fallen out with Purgon, he should consider a different marriage for his daughter. But Argan wants her put into a convent as a punishment for her willfulness. Beralde suggests that the real reason is that Béline wants it. Argan begins to get angry again, but Toinette steps in and says she has a solution to prove to Beralde how much Béline loves her husband. She suggests that Argan lie down on the couch and pretend to be dead. Then everyone will see how she really feels about him by her grief. Everyone thinks this is an excellent plan.

Beralde hides as Béline comes in. She finds Toinette crying and Toinette tells her Argan is dead. Béline does not shed a tear, but is instead overjoyed that Argan is finally dead. She calls him many horrible names, then asks Toinette to help her cover up his death until she can get his money. With that, Argan gets up and surprises Béline. He shouts that he's glad to have found her out as she runs off. Just then they hear Angelique coming, and Toinette suggests he do the same thing to find out how she feels.

When Angelique hears that her father is dead, she is inconsolable. She cries and says that she has lost one of the dearest things in the world to her. She is even more upset because she has lost him when he was still angry with her. Cléante comes in to comfort her, but it is no good. She tells Cléante that they can never get married now; since her father's last wishes were that she be a nun, that is what she will do.

With that, Argan gets up and hugs his daughter. She and Cléante are both delighted that he is alive. Argan agrees to their marriage, saying that she and Cléante can marry... as long as Cléante becomes a doctor. He agrees, but Beralde stops him. He suggests that Argan should just become a doctor himself, since no disease would dare to attack a doctor. Argan approves of the idea and Beralde says he knows a number of members of the medical faculty who can make Argan a doctor that very night.

He invites the gypsy dancers back and they perform a ceremony in song and dance that, they claim, makes Argan a doctor(in the translation by John Wood, Argan suffers a heart attack during the dance and dies, whereupon the dancers stop dancing and assume deaths-head masks).

An hour-long version adapted by Richard MacDonald was broadcast on the NBC radio seriesGreat Playson 15 December 1940.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19506,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court,"Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident ofEast Hartford,Connecticut, after a blow to the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time toearly medieval England, where he meets King Arthur.

Many passages are quoted directly from SirThomas Malory'sLe Morte d'Arthur, a late medieval collection of Arthurian legends that constitutes one of the main sources on the myth of King Arthur andCamelot. The frame narrator is a 19th-century man (ostensibly Mark Twain himself) who meets Hank Morgan in modern times and begins reading Hank's book in the museum in which they both meet. Later, characters in the story retell parts of it in Malory's original language. A chapter on medieval hermits also draws from the work ofWilliam Edward Hartpole Lecky.

The story begins as afirst-person narrativeinWarwick Castle, where a man details his recollection of a tale told to him by an ""interested stranger"" who is personified as a knight through his simple language and familiarity with ancient armor.

After a brief tale ofSir LancelotofCamelotand his role in slaying two giants from thethird-person narrative, taken directly fromLe Morte d'Arthur, Hank Morgan enters and is persuaded to reveal more of his story. Hank is a superintendent because of his proficiency in firearms manufacturing, with 2,000 subordinates. During a disagreement with his subordinates, he sustains a head injury when a man named ""Hercules"" hits him with a crowbar.

Hank wakes up underneath an oak tree, having no idea how he got there. Hank soon encounters the knightSir Kay. Kay challenges him to ajoust, which is quickly lost by the unweaponed, unarmored Hank as he scuttles up a tree. Kay captures Hank and leads him towards Camelot Castle. Upon recognizing that he has traveled back to the 6th century, Hank realizes that he is the de facto smartest person on Earth and that with his knowledge, he should soon be running things.

Hank is ridiculed at King Arthur's court for his strange appearance and dress and is sentenced by them, particularly the magicianMerlin, to burn at the stake on June 21. By a stroke of luck, the date coincides with a historicalsolar eclipsein 528, of which Hank had learned in his earlier life. In prison, he sends the boy whom he christens Clarence (whose real name isAmyas le Poulet) to inform the king that he will blot out the sun if he is executed. Hank believes it is June 20; however, it is actually the 21st when he makes his threat, the day that the eclipse will occur at 12:03 p.m. When the king decides to burn him, the eclipse catches Hank by surprise. However, he quickly convinces the people that he caused it. He makes a bargain with the king, is released, and becomes the second most powerful person in the kingdom. (Twain may have drawn inspiration for that part of the story from a historical incident in whichChristopher Columbus exploited foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse.)

Hank is given the position of principal minister to the king and is treated by all with the utmost fear and awe. He proclaims that his only income will be taken as a percentage of any increase in the kingdom'sgross national product, from his efforts as Arthur's chief minister.

Hank learns about medieval practices and superstitions. With his superior knowledge, he is able to outdo alleged sorcerers and miracle-working church officials. At one point, soon after the eclipse, people begin gathering, hoping to see Hank perform another miracle. Merlin, jealous of Hank having replaced him as both the king's principal adviser and the most powerful sorcerer of the realm, begins spreading rumors that Hank is a fake. Hank secretly manufactures gunpowder and a lightning rod, plants explosive charges in Merlin's tower, places the lightning rod at the top, and runs a wire to the explosive charges. He then announces (when storms are frequent) that he will soon call down fire from heaven and destroy Merlin's tower, challenging Merlin to use his sorcery to prevent it. Lightning strikes the rod, triggering the explosive charges and leveling the tower, further diminishing Merlin's reputation.

Hank Morgan uses his authority and knowledge to industrialize the country behind the backs of the rest of the ruling class. His assistant is Clarence, a young boy he meets at court, whom he educates, gradually lets in on most of his secrets, and eventually comes to rely on heavily. Hank sets up secret schools, which teach modern ideas and modern English, thereby removing the new generation from medieval concepts, and secretly constructs hidden factories, which produce modern tools and weapons. He carefully selects the individuals he allows to enter his factories and schools.

As Hank gradually adjusts to his new situation, he begins to attend medieval tournaments. A misunderstanding causesSir Sagramoreto challenge him to a duel to the death. The combat will take place when Sagramore returns from his quest for theHoly Grail. Hank accepts and spends the next few years building up 19th-century infrastructure behind the nobility's back. He then undertakes an adventure with a wandering girl named the Demoiselle Alisande a la Carteloise, nicknamed ""Sandy"" by Hank, to save her royal ""mistresses"" held captive by ogres. On the way, Hank encountersMorgan le Fay. The ""princesses"", ""ogres"", and ""castles"" are all revealed to actually be pigs owned by peasant swineherds, but to Sandy, they still appear as royalty. Hank buys the pigs from the peasants, and the two leave.

On the way back to Camelot, they find a traveling group of pilgrims headed for the Valley of Holiness. Another group of pilgrims, however, comes from that direction and bears the news that the valley's famous fountain has run dry. According to legend, long ago, the fountain had gone dry as soon as the monks of the valley's monastery built a bath with it. The bath was destroyed and the water instantly returned, but this time, it has stopped with no clear cause. Hank is begged to restore the fountain, although Merlin is already trying to do so. When Merlin fails, he claims that the fountain has been corrupted by a demon and that it will never flow again. Hank procures assistants from Camelot, who bring along a pump and fireworks for special effects. They repair the fountain and Hank ""banishes"" the demon. The fountain restored, Hank goes on to debunk another magician who claims to be able to tell what any person in the world is doing, including King Arthur. However, Hank knows via telephone that the king is riding out to see the restored fountain and not ""resting from the chase"" as the ""false prophet"" had claimed. Hank correctly states that the king will arrive in the valley.

Hank has an idea to travel among the poor disguised as a peasant to find out how they truly live. King Arthur joins him but has extreme difficulty in acting like a peasant convincingly. Arthur becomes somewhat disillusioned by seeing for himself the standard of life of his subjects. The two encounter villagers in a minor fiefdom of Arthur's realm, where Arthur is taken as a madman when he makes several outlandish and erroneous comments about agriculture. Hank attempts to teach the villagers about a rudimentary value theory of wages that they rebuff and in his zeal to win the argument, accidentally acknowledges that a member of his audience overpaid a worker, a capital offense. The audience then forms a mob that chases Hank and Arthur down. They seem to be delivered from danger when a nobleman invites them into his entourage, but he enslaves them and sells them to another particularly ruthless enslaver, who takes them to London.

Hank steals a piece of metal in London and uses it to create a makeshiftlockpick. However, before he can free the king, a man enters their quarters in the dark. Mistaking him for the slave driver, Hank starts a fight with him. They are both arrested. Hank lies his way out, but in his absence, the real slave driver has discovered Hank's escape. Since Hank was the most valuable slave, he was due to be sold the next day. The man becomes enraged and begins beating his other slaves, who fight back and kill him. All the slaves, including the king, will be hanged as soon as Hank is found. Hank is captured, but he and Arthur are rescued by a party of knights led byLancelot, riding bicycles. Then, the king becomes extremely bitter against slavery and vows to abolish it when they get free, much to Hank's delight.

Sagramore returns from his quest and fights Hank, who defeats him and seven others, including Galahad and Lancelot, using a lasso. When Merlin steals Hank's lasso, Sagramore returns to challenge him again. This time, Hank kills him with a revolver. He proceeds to challenge the knights of Britain to attack him en masse, which they do. After he kills nine more knights with his revolvers, the rest break and flee. The next day, Hank reveals his 19th-century infrastructure to the country.

Three years later, Hank has married Sandy, and they have a baby. When the child falls critically ill, Hank's doctors advise him to take his family overseas while the baby recovers. In reality, it is a ploy by the Catholic Church to get Hank out of the country. During the weeks that Hank is absent, Arthur discoversGuinevere's infidelity with Lancelot. That causes a war between Lancelot and Arthur, who is eventually killed bySir Mordred.

The Church then places the land underinterdict, causing the people to revolt against Hank. Hank sees that something is wrong and returns to Britain. Clarence informs him of the war. As time goes on, Clarence gathers 52 teenage cadets, who are to fight against all of Britain. Hank's band fortifies itself in Merlin's Cave with a minefield,electric wire, andGatling guns. The Church sends an army of 30,000 knights to attack them, but they are slaughtered by the cadets.

However, Hank's men are now trapped in the cave by a wall of dead bodies and sickened by themiasmabred by thousands of corpses. Hank attempts to offer aid to any wounded but is stabbed by the first wounded man he tries to help, SirMeliagraunce. He is not seriously injured but is bedridden. Disease begins to set in. One night, Clarence finds Merlin weaving a spell over Hank, proclaiming that he will sleep for 1,300 years. Merlin begins laughing deliriously but ends up electrocuting himself on one of the electric wires. Clarence and the others all apparently die from disease in the cave.

More than a millennium later, the narrator finishes the manuscript and finds Hank on his deathbed and dreaming about Sandy. He attempts to make one last ""effect"" but dies before he can finish it.

Twain's first encounter with theMorte d'Arthuroccurred in 1880, when someone in his household boughtSidney Lanier'sbowdlerizededition,The Boy's King Arthur.[3]Whether he read this children's version or not is not known. However, he certainly read the unexpurgated work after his close friendGeorge Washington Cablerecommended it to him in November 1884. The pair were traveling on the lecture circuit as the ""Twins of Genius"" during the winter of 1884–1885 when Cable spotted theMorteon the front table of aRochester,New York, bookstore that both were perusing. Cable pointed to the volume and said, ""You will never lay it down until you have read it cover to cover.""[4]Twain bought this copy and read it in nearly one sitting during a train ride to their next lecture date. After his own book's great success, Twain credited Cable for his inspiration, referring to him as ""the Godfather of my book"".[4]

Soon thereafter, in December 1884, Twain conceived of the idea behindA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Courtand worked on its realization between 1885 and 1889.[5]The bulk of its composition was done at Twain's summer home atElmira, New York, and was completed inHartford, Connecticut.[6]It was first published in England byChatto & Windusunder the titleA Yankee at the Court of King Arthurin December 1889.[7]

Writer and criticWilliam Dean Howellscalled it Twain's best work and ""an object-lesson in democracy"".[8]The work was met with some indignation in Great Britain, where it was perceived as ""a direct attack on [its] hereditary and aristocratic institutions"".[6]

The book pokes fun at contemporary society, but the main thrust is asatireof romanticized ideas ofchivalryand the idealization of theMiddle Agescommon in the novels ofSir Walter Scottand other 19th-century literature. Twain had a particular dislike for Scott, blaming his kind of romanticizing of battle for theSouthern states' deciding to fight theAmerican Civil War. He writes inLife on the Mississippi:

For example, the book portrays the medieval people as being very gullible, as when Merlin makes a ""veil of invisibility"" that, according to him, will make the wearer imperceptible to his enemies, though friends can still see him. The knight SirSagramorwears it to fight Hank, who pretends that he cannot see Sagramor for effect to the audience.

Hank Morgan's opinions are also strongly denunciatory toward theCatholic Churchof the medieval period; the Church is seen by the Yankee as an oppressive institution that stiflesscienceand teaches peasantsmeeknessonly as a means of preventing the overthrow of Church rule and taxation. The book also contains many depictions and condemnations of the dangers ofsuperstitionand the horrors ofslavery.

The book provides evidence of Twain's growing interest inGeorgisteconomics and social theory.[10]This is particularly evident in the interpretative illustrations by Georgist activistDaniel Carter Beard. Twain approved each illustration, and the editors ofThe Mark Twain Encyclopediaconsidered the illustrations an essential part of the work.[11]

George Orwellstrongly disapproved of the book: ""[Twain] squandered his time on boffooneries [such as]A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which is a deliberate flattery of all that is worst and most vulgar in American Life"" (e.g., the various American inventions and institutions Hank Morgan introduces into sixth-century Britain and whose excellence and superiority are taken for granted).[12]

It is possible to see the book as an important transitional work for Twain in that earlier, sunnier passages recall the frontier humor of his tall tales such asThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, while the corrosive view of human behavior in the apocalyptic latter chapters is more akin to darker, later Twain works such asThe Mysterious StrangerandLetters from the Earth.

George Hardy notes, ""The final scenes of 'Connecticut Yankee' depict massed cavalry attempting to storm a position defended by wire and machine guns—and getting massacred, none reaching their objective. Deduct the fantasy anachronism of the assailants being Medieval knights, and you get a chillingly accurate prediction of a typicalFirst World Warbattle.... The modern soldiers of 1914 with their bayonets had no more chance to win such a fight than Twain's knights.""[13]

One frequently overlooked aspect of the book is the emotional intensity felt by Hank toward his family:[original research?]wife Sandy and baby Hello-Central.  Twain's own son, Langdon, died of diphtheria at the age of 19 months, which was likely reflected in Hello-Central's membranous croup. Twain also outlived two of his three daughters, but they both died after the completion of the book. The last chapters of the book are full of Hank's pronouncements of love, culminating in his final delirium, where ""an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you!"" is worse than death.[2]

WhileConnecticut Yankeeis sometimes credited as the foundational work in thetime travelsubgenre ofscience fiction, Twain's novel had several important immediate predecessors. Among them areH. G. Wells's story ""The Chronic Argonauts"" (1888), which was a precursor toThe Time Machine(1895). Also published the year beforeConnecticut YankeewasEdward Bellamy's wildly popularLooking Backward(1888), in which the protagonist is put into a hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up in the year 2000. Yet another American novel that could have served as a more direct inspiration to Twain wasThe Fortunate Island(1882) byCharles Heber Clark. In this novel, a technically proficient American is shipwrecked on an island that broke off from Britain during Arthurian times and never developed any further.[14]

Twain's book introduced what remains one of the main literary devices used in time travel literature—a modern person is suddenly hurled into the past by some force completely beyond the traveler's control, is stuck there irrevocably, and must make the best of it—typically by trying to introduce modern inventions and institutions into the past society. Several works considered classics of science fiction clearly follow on this pattern set by Twain, such asL. Sprague de Camp'sLest Darkness FallandPoul Anderson's ""The Man Who Came Early"". This strand of time travel literature is clearly distinct from that following the basic pattern of Wells's works, where the protagonist is in possession of a time machine and is able to travel at will back and forth in time. The literary device continues to see use throughout modern science fiction, from popular American time travel stories such asMichael Crichton'sTimelineto JapaneseIsekailikeHandyman Saitō in Another World.[15]"
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6923,The Miser,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miser,"Aside from the example of contemporary misers,[16]Molière drew from a number of ancient and contemporary sources for elements in hisThe Miser. The character of Harpagon draws from theLatinplayAululariabyPlautusin which the miser Euclio incessantly changes the hiding place of his pot of gold out of fear of having it stolen, and the miser's fourth-act[b]monologue exaggerating the loss of his pot was the basis for  Harpagon's.  Also fromAululariaMolière appropriated the love affair between Élise and Valère, Harpagon's inspection of the hands of La Flèche, and Valère's avowals of love for Élise that Harpagon takes as his confession to theft.[17]La Belle Plaideuse(1655) ofFrançois le Métel de Boisrobertfurnished Molière with the father-as-usurer, and the scene in which a lender lends the borrower 15,000 francs, of which 3,000 is in goods;[18]several of these items appear in the list inThe Miser.[13]Jean Donneau de Visé'sla Mère coquette(1665) gave Molière a father and son in love with the same young woman.[citation needed]

Very soon after the play's first production in 1668, versions began to appear elsewhere in Europe. A German translation,Der Geizige, appeared in Frankfurt in 1670.[19]In EnglandThomas Shadwelladapted Molière's work under the title ""The Miser"" in 1672 and added eight new characters.[20]An even more popular version based on both Plautus and Molière was produced byHenry Fieldingin 1732.[21]

In Italiancommedia dell'artethere was already a tradition of depicting misers as the Pantaleone figure, who was represented as a rich and avaricious Venetian merchant.[22]However, Molière's play was eventually adapted to opera.Giovanni Bertati's libretto based on the play was set byPasquale AnfossiasL'avaroin 1775 and in 1776 it was  set again byGennaro Astarita. Giuseppe Palomba also wrote a libretto based on the work which was set byGiacomo Cordellain 1814. In Russia, too,Vasily Pashkevichbased his 18th century comic operaThe Miseron Molière's play. Another musical adaptation in Arabic was pioneered by the LebaneseMarun Al Naqqash(1817–55) asal-Bakhil. This was performed in Beirut in 1847.[23]

Jovan Sterija Popović, the founding father ofSerbiantheatre, based hisTvrdica(The Miser, 1837) on Molière's play. In this work, the Harpagon figure is represented as a small town Greek merchant.[24]

One reason for so many versions must be the acknowledged fact that Molière's humour does not translate well and requires more or less free adaptation to succeed.[25]The history ofDe Vrek, Taco de Beer's 1863 translation into Dutch provides another notable example. In 1878 he adapted this to Dutch contemporary life and an edition of that version found its way toIndonesia. There it was further adapted intoMalayasSi Bachiland given a contemporary Indonesian background. In 1941 this production in turn served as basis for Tamar Djaja's novel of the same title, by which time the story had become all but unrecognisable.[26]

The earliest American production of a play titledThe Miserwas of Fielding's version in the years following 1766.[27]ABroadwayproduction of a translation of Molière's play ran for only three nights at the Experimental Theatre in 1936[28]and there have been several revivals since in one version or another.

In 1954,The Laird o' Grippy, a free translation intoScotsbyRobert Kemp, was staged by theEdinburgh Gateway Company, withJohn Lauriein the leading role.[29]

An audio recording of the 1969Lincoln Centerproduction produced byJules Irvingand directed byCarl Weberwas released byCaedmon Records(TRS 338). This recording of the adaptation byRanjit Boltis available at theInternet Archive.[30]The play itself ran at theVivian Beaumont Theaterfor 52 performances.[31]

An Australian musical theatre adaptation with the nameMistress Moneypremiered in Sydney in 1960. It had book and lyrics by Eleanor Witcombe and John McKellar and music by Dot Mendoza.[32]

More recently in Britain, John Coutts' English-Scotsversion ofThe Miserwas performed in 2009 under the titleThe Auld Skinflint.[33]In 2012 the play was made into a Bollywood musical titledKanjoos The MiserbyHardeep Singh Kohliand Jatinder Verma and toured the UK.[34]"
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1051,Sartor Resartus: The Life and Opinions of Herr Teufelsdröckh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartor_Resartus,"The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English publicationFraser's Magazine(in which the novel was first serialised without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is, upon request, reviewing the fictional German bookClothes, Their Origin and Influenceby the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (Professor of ""Things in General"" at Weissnichtwo - i.e. ""Know-not-where"" - University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain it in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdröckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book's philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests to Teufelsdröckh's office in Germany for more biographical information, hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdröckh's book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor's many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations fromGoetheandShakespeare. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor's frustration at the philosophy, and his desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received a reply from Teufelsdröckh's office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organised according to thesigns of the Latin Zodiac) on which are written autobiographical fragments.[citation needed]

At the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organised the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdröckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl (""Duck-pond""); his father a retired sergeant ofFrederick the Greatand his mother a very pious woman, who, to Teufelsdröckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdröckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting how most of his descriptions originate in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdröckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (""Slap-behind"")Gymnasium. While there, Teufelsdröckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent: glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character, as regarding both his own treatment and his education's application to politics. While at university, Teufelsdröckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post and some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdröckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (""Goddess of Flowers""; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdröckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, and leaves the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated""Everlasting No"", disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdröckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a ""Centre of Indifference"", and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in the ""Everlasting Yea"". The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdröckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy.[citation needed]

Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh:(Greek/German: ""Zeus-Born Devil's Dung"") The Professor of ""Things in General"" at Weissnichtwo University, and writer of a long book ofGerman idealist philosophycalledClothes, Their Origin and Influence, the review of which forms the contents of the novel. Both professor and book are fictional.[citation needed]

The Editor:The narrator of the novel, who in reviewing Teufelsdröckh's book, reveals much about his own tastes, as well as deep sympathy towards Teufelsdröckh, and much worry as to social issues of his day. His tone varies between conversational, and condemning and even semi-Biblical prophecy. The Reviewer should not be confused with Carlyle himself, seeing as much of Teufelsdröckh's life implements Carlyle's own biography.[4]

Hofrath:Hofrath Heuschrecke (i. e. State-Councillor Grasshopper) is a loose, zigzag figure, a blind admirer of Teufelsdröckh's, an incarnation of distraction distracted, and the only one who advises the editor and encourages him in his work; a victim to timidity and preyed on by an uncomfortable sense of mere physical cold, such as the majority of the state-counsellors of the day were.[14]

Blumine:A woman associated to the German nobility with whom Teufelsdröckh falls in love early in his career. Her spurning of him to marry Towgood leads Teufelsdröckh to the spiritual crisis that culminates in the Everlasting No. Their relationship is somewhat parodic of Werther's spurned love for Lotte inThe Sorrows of Young Werther(including her name ""Goddess of Flowers"", which may simply be a pseudonym), though, as the Editor notes, Teufelsdröckh does not take as much incentive as does Werther. Critics have associated her withKitty Kirkpatrick, with whom Carlyle himself fell in love before marryingJane Carlyle.[15][16]

Towgood:The English aristocrat who ultimately marries Blumine, throwing Teufelsdröckh into a spiritual crisis. If Blumine is indeed a fictionalization ofKitty Kirkpatrick, Towgood would find his original in Captain James Winslowe Phillipps, who married Kirkpatrick in 1829.[15][16]

Dumdrudge:Dumdrudge is an imaginaryvillagewhere the natives drudge away and say nothing about it, as villagers all over the world contentedly do.[17]

""Weissnichtwo"":In the book, Weissnichtwo (weiß-nicht-wo, German for ""know-not-where"") is an imaginary European city, viewed as the focus, and as exhibiting the operation, of all the influences for good and evil of the time, described in terms which characterised city life in the first quarter of the 19th century; so universal appeared the spiritual forces at work in society at that time that it was impossible to say where they were and where they were not, and hence the name of the city, ""Know-not-where"" (cf. SirWalter Scott'sKennaquhair).[18]

Sartor Resartuswas intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where ""truth"" is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier inTristram Shandy, to which it refers. The imaginary ""Philosophy of Clothes"" holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over time, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith-systems. The book contains a veryFichteanconception ofreligious conversion: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to seeSartor Resartusas an earlyexistentialisttext.[19][20]

One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as Teufelsdröckh's publisher being named Stillschweigen and Co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdröckh's father is introduced as an earnest believer inWalter Shandy's doctrine that ""there is much, nay almost all in Names"".[21]

James Frasercomplained to Carlyle that its initial serial publication had been received negatively in many quarters.[22]The most substantive early treatment came in the form of an 1835 letter to Carlyle from his friendJohn Sterling. Sterling compared it toFrançois Rabelais,Michel de Montaigne,Laurence SterneandJonathan Swift, while taking issue with Carlyle's style and what he perceived as Teufelsdröckh'spantheism.[23]

Sartor Resartuswas best received in America, where Carlyle became a dominant cultural influence and a perceived leader of theTranscendental Movement. In 1834,Harriet Martineau, visiting from England, observed its effect: ""The book is acting upon them with wonderful force. It has regenerated the preaching of more than one of the clergy; and, I have reason to believe, the minds and lives of several of the laity.""[24]After its 1836 arrival in Boston as a book,Nathaniel Langdon Frothinghamaccurately predicted that reaction would be divided between those that found it vapid and convoluted and those that found it insightful and philosophically fruitful.[25]James Russell Lowellregarded the book as ""the signal for a sudden mental and moral mutiny"".[26]

In 1855,George Eliotwrote of Carlyle:

According to Rodger L. Tarr, ""The influence ofSartor Resartusupon American Literature is so vast, so pervasive, that it is difficult to overstate."" Tarr notes its influence on such leading American writers asRalph Waldo Emerson,Emily Dickinson,Henry David Thoreau,Herman Melville,Margaret Fuller,Louisa May AlcottandMark Twain(Nathaniel HawthorneandEdgar Allan Poewere among those that read and objected to the book).[28]Andrew Preston Peabodywrote in 1860 that ""Carlyle first took a strong hold on the cultivated mind of America by his 'Sartor Resartus,'—a work more full of seed-thoughts than any single volume of the present century,"" adding that the following publication of theCritical and Miscellaneous Essays""was in almost every one's hands.""[29]Charles Godfrey Lelandwrote that he ""read it through forty times ere I left college, of which I 'kept count.'""[30]William Henry Milburnwrote that he ""was as familiar with the everlasting Nay, the Centre of Indifference, and the everlasting Yea, as with the side walk in front of my house.""[31]

Keir Hardierecalled reading the book as a teenager until ""the spirit of it somewhat entered into me"". His encounter with Carlyle became one of the most enduring influences of his life, shaping his radicalism and pacifism.[32]

Jorge Luis Borgesgreatly admired the book, recounting that in 1916 at age 17 ""[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I readSartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.""[33]Many of Borges' first characteristic and most admired works employ the same technique of intentionalpseudepigraphyas Carlyle,[34][failed verification]such as ""The Garden of Forking Paths"" and ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"".[citation needed]

Paul Gauguinpainted the book in his portrait ofMeyer de Haan, who had imported the book intoPont-Aven.Maurice Maeterlinckvalued Carlyle's ideas on silence.Claude Debussycalled the book ""that cruel breviary of humor"" and imagined a missing chapter, ""The Relationship of the Hat to Music.""[35]T. J. Cobden-Sandersonchose the book as a piece of ""eternal literature"" for hisDoves Press.[36]

Martin Luther King Jr.paraphrased a line from book 2, chapter 7, paragraph 4 ofSartor Resartusin a sermon delivered in 1957: ""In our moments of despair, some of us find ourselves crying out with the earnest belief of Carlyle, 'It seems that God sits in His heaven and does nothing.'""[37]

The novel has been identified as containing the first appearance in English of the proverb ""Speech is silver, silence is golden"",[38]as well as the first English use of the expression ""meaning of life.""[39]

Scottish literary criticAlastair Fowlerused the book as an example of his term ""poioumenon"", a work that addresses the process of its own creation.[40]

The book is increasingly recognized as ""the founding text for the emergence of the serious and organized study of clothing"", otherwise termed ""dress studies"" or ""fashion theory"".[41]"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1156,Babbitt,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbitt_(novel),"The Smart Set's review of the novel stated, ""There is no plot whatever... Babbitt simply grows two years older as the tale unfolds.""[4]

The first seven chapters follow George F. Babbitt's life over the course of a single day. Over breakfast, Babbitt, a successful real estate broker, dotes on his ten-year-old daughter Tinka, tries to dissuade his 22-year-old daughter Verona from her newfound socialist leanings, and encourages his 17-year-old son Ted to try harder in school. At the office he dictates letters and discusses real estate advertising with his employees. Gradually, Babbitt realizes his dissatisfaction with ""The American Dream"", and attempts to quell these feelings by going camping inMainewith his close friend and old college roommate Paul Riesling. Although the trip has its ups and downs, the two men consider it an overall success and leave feeling optimistic about the year ahead.

On the day Babbitt gets elected vice-president of the Booster's club, he finds out that Paul shot his wife Zilla. Babbitt immediately drives to the jail where Paul is being held, trying to think of ways to help Paul out. Shortly after Paul's arrest, Babbitt's wife and daughter go to visit relatives, leaving Babbitt more or less on his own. Babbitt begins to ask himself what it was he really wanted in life. In time, Babbitt begins to rebel against all of the standards he formerly held: he jumps into liberal politics with famous socialist/""single tax"" litigator Seneca Doane, conducts an extramaritalaffair, goes on various vacations, and cavorts around Zenith withbohemiansandflappers. He slowly becomes aware that his forays into nonconformity are not only futile but also destructive of the life and the friends he once loved.

When Babbitt's wife falls ill with acuteappendicitis, Babbitt rushes home and relinquishes all rebellion. During her long recovery, they rekindle their intimacy and Babbitt reverts to dispassionate conformity. In the final scene, Babbitt discovers that his son Ted has secretly married Eunice, the daughter of his neighbor. He offers his approval of the marriage, stating that though he does not agree, he admires Ted for living his life on his own terms.

Zenith is a fictitious city in the equally fictitious Midwestern state of ""Winnemac"", adjacent toOhio,Indiana,Illinois, andMichigan. (Babbittdoes not mention Winnemac by name, but Lewis's subsequent novelArrowsmithelaborates on its location.) WhenBabbittwas published, newspapers inCincinnati,Duluth,Kansas City,Milwaukee, andMinneapoliseach claimed that their city was the model for Zenith.[5]Cincinnati had perhaps the strongest claim, as Lewis had lived there while researching the book.[6]Lewis's own correspondence suggests, however, that Zenith is meant to be any Midwestern city with a population between about 200,000 and 300,000.[7]

Lewis was highly critical of the similarities among mostAmerican cities, especially when compared to the diverse—and in his view, culturally richer—cities of Europe. Frowning on the interchangeable qualities of American cities, he wrote: ""it would not be possible to write a novel which would in every line be equally true toMunichandFlorence.""[8]

While conducting research forBabbitt, Lewis kept detailed journals, in which he drafted long biographies for each of his characters. For his title character this biography even included a detailedgenealogy, as well as a list of Babbitt's college courses. Zenith's major names and families are documented in these journals, and many of them emerge again in Lewis's later writings. Zenith's layout is also imagined in careful detail. Lewis drew a series of 18 maps of Zenith and outlying areas, including Babbitt's house, with all its furnishings.[9]

After the social instability and sharpeconomic depressionthat followedWorld War I, many Americans in the 1920s saw business and city growth as foundations for stability. Thecivic boostersand self-made men of the middle-class represented particularly American depictions of success, at a time when the promotion of the American identity was crucial in the face of rising fears ofCommunism.[10]At the same time, growing Midwestern cities, usually associated withmass productionand the emergence of a consumer society, were also seen as emblems of American progress. George F. Babbitt, the novel's main character, was described by the 1930 Nobel Prize committee as ""the ideal of an American popular hero of the middle-class. The relativity of business morals as well as private rules of conduct is for him an accepted article of faith, and without hesitation he considers it God's purpose that man should work, increase his income, and enjoy modern improvements.""[11]

To his publisher, Lewis wrote: “[George Babbitt] is all of us Americans at 46, prosperous, but worried, wanting — passionately — to seize something more than motor cars and a housebefore it's too late.”[12]About the novel, Lewis said: “This is the story of the ruler of America” wherein the “tired American Businessman” wielded socioeconomic power not through his exceptionality but rather through militantconformity. Lewis portrayed the American businessman as a man deeply dissatisfied with and privately aware of his shortcomings; he is “the most grievous victim of his own militant dullness” who secretly longed for freedom and romance.[13]Readers who praised thepsychological realismof the portrait admitted to regularly encountering Babbitts in real life but also could relate to some of the character's anxieties about conformity and personal fulfillment. Published two years after Lewis's previous novel (Main Street, 1920), the story of George F. Babbitt was much anticipated because each novel presented a portrait of American society wherein “the principal character is brought into conflict with the accepted order of things, sufficiently to illustrate its ruthlessness.”[14]

Although many other popular novelists writing at the time ofBabbitt's publication depict the ""Roaring Twenties"" as an era of social change and disillusionment with material culture, modern scholars argue that Lewis was not himself a member of the ""lost generation"" of younger writers likeErnest HemingwayorF. Scott Fitzgerald. Instead, he was influenced by theProgressive Era; and changes in the American identity that accompanied the country's rapidurbanization, technological growth,industrialization, and the closing of the frontier.[15]Although the Progressive Era had built a protective barrier around the upstanding American businessman, one literary scholar wrote that ""Lewis was fortunate enough to come on the scene just as the emperor's clothes were disappearing.""[16]Lewis has been compared to many authors, writing before and after the publication ofBabbitt, who made similar criticisms of themiddle class. Although it was published in 1899, long beforeBabbitt,Thorstein Veblen'sThe Theory of the Leisure Class, which critiqued consumer culture and social competition at the turn of the 20th century, is an oft-cited point of comparison.[17]Written decades later, in 1950,David Riesman'sThe Lonely Crowdhas also been compared to Lewis's writings.[18]

The social critic and satiristH. L. Mencken, an ardent supporter of Sinclair Lewis, called himself “an old professor of Babbittry” and said thatBabbittwas a stunning work ofliterary realismabout American society.[4]To Mencken, George F. Babbitt was an archetype of the American city dwellers who touted the virtues of Republicanism, Presbyterianism, and absolute conformity because ""it is not what he [Babbitt] feels and aspires that moves him primarily; it is what the folks about him will think of him. His politics is communal politics, mob politics, herd politics; his religion is a public rite wholly without subjective significance.""[4]Mencken said that Babbitt was the literary embodiment of everything wrong with American society.[4]In the cultural climate of the early 20th century, like-minded critics and Mencken's followers were known as ""Babbitt-baiters"".[19]

Despite Mencken's praise ofBabbittas unflinching social satire, other critics found exaggeration in Lewis's depiction of the American businessman. In the book review “From Maupassant to Mencken” (1922),Edmund Wilsoncompared Lewis's style inBabbittto the more “graceful” writing styles of satirists such asCharles DickensandMark Twainand said that, as a prose stylist, Lewis's literary “gift is almost entirely for making people nasty” and the characters unbelievable.[20]Concurring with Wilson that Lewis was no Twain, another critic dismissedBabbittas “a monstrous, bawling, unconscionable satire” and said “Mr. Lewis is the most phenomenally skillful exaggerator in literature today.”[21]Nonetheless, in its first year of publication, 140,997 copies of the novel were sold in the U.S.[22]In the mid-1920s, Babbitt-baiting became an irritant to American businessmen,Rotarians, and the like, who began defending the Babbitts of the U.S. by way of radio and magazine journalism. They emphasized the virtues of community organizations and the positive contributions that industrial cities have made to American society.[23]

Babbitthas been converted into films twice, a feat that David Sterrritt ofTurner Classic Moviesdescribes as ""impressive for a novel that barely has a plot.""[24]The first adaptationwas asilent filmreleased in 1924 and starringWillard Louisas George F. Babbitt. According to Warner Bros. records, that version cost $123,000 and made $278,000 from domestic rentals and $28,000 from foreign rentals for a total box office of $306,000.[25]

The secondwas a 1934talkiestarringGuy Kibbee. That version, while remaining somewhat true to Lewis's novel, takes liberties with the plot, exaggerating Babbitt's affair and a sour real estate deal.[24]Both films wereWarner Bros.productions.[citation needed]

In November 2023, theLa Jolla Playhousepremiered a play adaptation ofBabbittstarringMatthew Broderickas part of their 2023-2024 Season.[26]TheShakespeare Theatre Companyin Washington, DC, opened the play in October 2024.[27]

In American literature and popular culture, the character and behaviors of George F. Babbitt became established as negativearchetypesof person and personality; aBabbittis “a materialistic and complacent businessman conforming to the standards of his [social] set” andBabbittryis the “Philistinebehaviour of a Babbitt”.[28]Examples includeC. E. M. Joad's 1927 bookThe Babbitt Warren, a scathing critique of American society,[29]andVachel Lindsay's 1922 poem
""The Babbitt Jambouree.""[22]Elizabeth Stevenson referenced the character in the title of her popular history of the 1920s,Babbitts and Bohemians: From the Great War to the Great Depression.[30]

Bilbo Baggins, the main character inJ. R. R. Tolkien's novelThe Hobbitwas partly inspired byBabbitt, as was the title of the book itself. Bilbo and hobbits in general are known for being most comfortable at home, uninterested in adventure, and primarily concerned with the accumulation of food and possessions.[31][32][33]Other fictional influences are found inAldous Huxley'sEyeless in GazaandSaul Bellow'sHumboldt's Gift. In both novels, one character compares another character to George Babbitt, contrasting their aspirational qualities with their ultimate complacency. The novel is one of the inspirations of the novelRabbit, Run(the protagonist of which is also a complacent and unfulfilled businessman) and its sequels byJohn Updike.[34]"
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554,"Right Ho, Jeeves","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Ho,_Jeeves","Bertie returns to London from several weeks inCannesspent in the company of his AuntDahlia Travers, her daughter Angela and her soppy, childish friend Madeline Bassett. In Bertie's absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie's old school friend,Gussie Fink-Nottle, a shy teetotaller with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, who is in love with Madeline but is too timid to propose. Jeeves advises Gussie attend a fancy-dress ball (at Madeline’s invitation) dressed asMephistopheleswhich Jeeves believes will give Gussie the confidence to confess his love. This plan fails, because of Gussie's excessive goofiness. Owing to a strong disagreement about Bertie’s new mess jacket, Bertie harshly blames Jeeves for Gussie’s failure and tells him not to offer any more advice to him.

Gussie, though initially disturbed to hear Jeeves is no longer advising him, cheers up when Bertie tells him that Brinkley Court, where Madeline is staying, is also the country seat of Bertie's Aunt Dahlia andUncle Tom, and that he (Bertie) can easily get him (Gussie) an invitation to join her there. It happens that Aunt Dahlia had demanded that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school. Determined to avoid this task and to assist Gussie's wooing, Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place where he will have the chance to get close to Madeline, and also be forced to distribute the school prizes instead of himself. Aunt Dahlia begrudgingly agrees to this.

When Bertie hears that Angela has broken off her engagement toTuppy Glossop, he feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court himself, to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worrying about Angela's broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost £500 gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine,Milady's Boudoir. Bertie takes umbrage when Aunt Dahlia says the only reason she’s grateful Bertie came is because he brought Jeeves. When Bertie tries to offer her advice she vigorously refuses to let him speak. Bertie finds Tuppy in the grounds who tells him he and Angela fell out due to Angela saying he was getting fat and Tuppy not believing she was attacked by a shark in Cannes. Bertie advises Tuppy to regain Angela's sympathy by refusing his dinner. He offers similar advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline and to Aunt Dahlia to arouse Uncle Tom’s sympathy. All take his advice; however, neither Angela, nor Madeline nor Tom notice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food severely upsets Aunt Dahlia's temperamental prized French chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Aunt Dahlia understandably blames Bertie for this disaster.

Gussie still cannot confess his love to Madeline, so Bertie invites her for a walk to soften her up for him. Unfortunately she misinterprets his words as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose. Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with brandy.

Gussie ends up imbibing many times more brandy than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then presents the prizes to the schoolboys, with a drunken speech,  berating the staff and pupils. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement. Heartbroken and still drunk, Gussie proposes to Angela in order to score off Madeline; Angela accepts his proposal in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life. Madeline tells Bertie she will marry him instead of Gussie. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline appalls Bertie, but his personal code of chivalry will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his ""proposal"" and turning her down.

Helpless in the face of all this chaos, Bertie appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ring the fire bell at midnight so Gussie and Tuppy will respectively rescue Madeline and Angela. Although skeptical, Bertie follows this advice. However, when all the residents have evacuated the building, none of the estranged couples appear reconciled. When they try to return to bed, they find that all the doors are locked; no one has the keys, and all staff members away at a dance. Naturally, Bertie is blamed for the group being forced to spend the rest of the night outside. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ride a bicycle to the staff dance to retrieve the key from the butler. Bertie initially refuses but is forced by Aunt Dahlia. Bertie cycles the nine miles to the dance only to be told by the butler that he left the keys with Jeeves. Furious at having taken a long, dangerous ride in the dark, Bertie returns to Brinkley Court, and finds that Madeline and Gussie have made up, Angela and Tuppy have also made up, Anatole has withdrawn his notice and agreed to stay on, and Uncle Tom has agreed to lend Aunt Dahlia the £500 she needs. Jeeves explains that his true plan was to unite all the estranged parties in their contempt for Bertie by forcing them so spend the night outside and then in their collective amusement by finding the keys just after Bertie left, thus making his journey pointless. Though tired and aching, Bertie cannot argue with the results. Jeeves then says that he accidentally burned Bertie's mess jacket. Bertie is incensed, but agrees to let Jeeves have his way."
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21517,The Diary of a Nobody,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Nobody,"The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed thatCharles Pooterand his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at ""The Laurels"", Brickfield Terrace,Holloway. Mr Pooter works as a clerk in theCityfirm of Perkupp's. The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk inOldham. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses fromSutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.

The rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from theLord Mayor of Londonto attend a ball at theMansion Housefor ""Representatives of Trade and Commerce"". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.

In the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, ""Lupin"". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp's. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week inBroadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin's ""fast"" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the ""Holloway Comedians"". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.

Lupin's fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, ""the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met"".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: ""She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking"". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.

In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to ""The Laurels"". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.

In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.

April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.

Lupin is sacked from Perkupp's for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as ""Lillie Girl"", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and ""Lillie Girl"".

Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupp's a new client to replace Mr Crowbillon. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of ""The Laurels"" and presents thedeedsto Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to ""Lillie Girl"": ""We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings"".

TheDiarymade its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazinePunch.[8]The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: ""As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection"".[9]The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear inPunch.[10]ThePunchserialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupp's.[11]That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.[8]

In June 1892J.W. Arrowsmith Ltdpublished theDiaryin book form,[8]although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910.   After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982.[12]The writerRobert McCrum, in a personal list of ""The 100 greatest novels of all time"" published inThe Observernewspaper, listed theDiaryat number 35.[13]

ThePunchserialisation attracted little critical comment;The Athenaeum's literary critic thought the series ""may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes"".[15]When theDiarywas published as a book,Punchheralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as ""very funny"", adding: ""not without a touch of pathos"".[16]However, apart from a warmly approving report inThe Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. TheReview's critic thought the book ""admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius"", with a natural and irresistible appeal: ""TheDiaryhas amused us from cover to cover"".[17]This contrasted with the negative judgement ofThe Athenaeum, which opined that ""the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing"". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: ""Besides, it is all so dull"".[15]The Speaker's critic thought the book ""a study in vulgarity"",[18]whileThe New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: ""There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different"".[19]Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.[20]

By 1910 theDiarywas beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay ""On People in Books"", published earlier that year, the writer and humouristHilaire Bellochailed theDiaryas ""one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all"".[21]Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work wereLord Rosebery, the former prime minister, who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had ""purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it"".[22]Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute wasAugustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post ofChief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongsideDon Quixoteas a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—""an illiterate charwoman, it is true""—carried his name.[23]Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings.[n 1]In its review of this editionThe Bookman'scritic wrote of Charles Pooter: ""You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human"".[24]

In its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919,The Bookmanobserved that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. ""It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away"". The reviewer recommended the book's ""quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony"".[25]In Canada,Queen's Quarterlymagazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that ofThe New York Timesnearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that ""It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent"".[26]The literary criticD. B. Wyndham Lewissummarised the Pooters as ""warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads"".[27]

The novelistEvelyn Waughhad been familiar with theDiarysince his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waughused to read passages aloud to his family,[28]and Evelyn's biographerSelina Hastingshas drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household.[29]Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay ""One Way to Immortality"" that it was ""the funniest book in the world"". He added: ""Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years"".[30]Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world.[8]In his 1945 novelBrideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from theDiary""with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression"".[31]Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.[8]

At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for theDiaryanother writer,J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar ofEnglish humour;Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: ""[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart"".[32]In a 1943 essay,George Orwellconsidered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who ""constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly"".[33]In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high;Osbert Lancasterdeemed it ""a great work of art"",[34]and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians.Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought theDiary""the best comic novel in the language"", and lauded Pooter as ""the presiding shade"" of his era.[35]This accolade was echoed a further generation on byA. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: ""Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?""[36]Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as ""arbiters of the greatest good taste"", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted ""period"" homes.[37]ASpectatorarticle of 2008 remarks on how such houses as ""The Laurels"", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms ""banker land"".[38]

Peter Bailey, in his study ""White Collars, Gray Lives"" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the ""disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers"" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century.[39]The Grossmiths'Diarywas a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls theDiary""a sharp analysis of social insecurity"".[4]Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: ""putting the boot in on the lower middle classes"", says Bailey, ""has long been the intellectual's blood sport"".[40]However, the quarter-century following the publication ofThe Diary of a Nobodysaw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such asGeorge Gissing,H. G. Wells,Arnold BennettandE. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as ""Denry Machin"", ""Mr Polly"" or ""Mr Lewisham"", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, ""disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.""[40][41]

During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, ""been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds"".[8]An early example isAnita Loos's novel of 1925:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Ladyin which the protagonist,Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that ""follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech"" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, ""burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class"".[42]The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81Christopher Matthewproduced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of ""Simon Crisp"", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era.[43]The title of the first,The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume inThe Spectator,Benny Greenpoints out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is ""affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not"".[44]In 1982 came the first appearance ofSue Townsend's teenage creation,Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.[45]

Keith Waterhouse'sMrs Pooter's Diaryof 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter.[46]In 1996Helen Fieldingused the imaginary diary format forBridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life.The New York Timescritic wrote that it ""captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.""[47]This diary began as a weekly column inThe Independent. In the 1990s the satirical magazinePrivate EyelampoonedJohn Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in ""The Secret Diary of John Major aged 473⁄4"", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries withThe Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.[48][n 2]"

In Bertie's absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie's old school friend,Gussie Fink-Nottle, a shy teetotaller with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, who is in love with Madeline but is too timid to propose. Jeeves advises Gussie attend a fancy-dress ball (at Madeline’s invitation) dressed asMephistopheleswhich Jeeves believes will give Gussie the confidence to confess his love. This plan fails, because of Gussie's excessive goofiness. Owing to a strong disagreement about Bertie’s new mess jacket, Bertie harshly blames Jeeves for Gussie’s failure and tells him not to offer any more advice to him.

Gussie, though initially disturbed to hear Jeeves is no longer advising him, cheers up when Bertie tells him that Brinkley Court, where Madeline is staying, is also the country seat of Bertie's Aunt Dahlia andUncle Tom, and that he (Bertie) can easily get him (Gussie) an invitation to join her there. It happens that Aunt Dahlia had demanded that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school. Determined to avoid this task and to assist Gussie's wooing, Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place where he will have the chance to get close to Madeline, and also be forced to distribute the school prizes instead of himself. Aunt Dahlia begrudgingly agrees to this.

When Bertie hears that Angela has broken off her engagement toTuppy Glossop, he feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court himself, to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worrying about Angela's broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost £500 gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine,Milady's Boudoir. Bertie takes umbrage when Aunt Dahlia says the only reason she’s grateful Bertie came is because he brought Jeeves. When Bertie tries to offer her advice she vigorously refuses to let him speak. Bertie finds Tuppy in the grounds who tells him he and Angela fell out due to Angela saying he was getting fat and Tuppy not believing she was attacked by a shark in Cannes. Bertie advises Tuppy to regain Angela's sympathy by refusing his dinner. He offers similar advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline and to Aunt Dahlia to arouse Uncle Tom’s sympathy. All take his advice; however, neither Angela, nor Madeline nor Tom notice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food severely upsets Aunt Dahlia's temperamental prized French chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Aunt Dahlia understandably blames Bertie for this disaster.

Gussie still cannot confess his love to Madeline, so Bertie invites her for a walk to soften her up for him. Unfortunately she misinterprets his words as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose. Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with brandy.

Gussie ends up imbibing many times more brandy than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then presents the prizes to the schoolboys, with a drunken speech,  berating the staff and pupils. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement. Heartbroken and still drunk, Gussie proposes to Angela in order to score off Madeline; Angela accepts his proposal in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life. Madeline tells Bertie she will marry him instead of Gussie. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline appalls Bertie, but his personal code of chivalry will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his ""proposal"" and turning her down.

Helpless in the face of all this chaos, Bertie appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ring the fire bell at midnight so Gussie and Tuppy will respectively rescue Madeline and Angela. Although skeptical, Bertie follows this advice. However, when all the residents have evacuated the building, none of the estranged couples appear reconciled. When they try to return to bed, they find that all the doors are locked; no one has the keys, and all staff members away at a dance. Naturally, Bertie is blamed for the group being forced to spend the rest of the night outside. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ride a bicycle to the staff dance to retrieve the key from the butler. Bertie initially refuses but is forced by Aunt Dahlia. Bertie cycles the nine miles to the dance only to be told by the butler that he left the keys with Jeeves. Furious at having taken a long, dangerous ride in the dark, Bertie returns to Brinkley Court, and finds that Madeline and Gussie have made up, Angela and Tuppy have also made up, Anatole has withdrawn his notice and agreed to stay on, and Uncle Tom has agreed to lend Aunt Dahlia the £500 she needs. Jeeves explains that his true plan was to unite all the estranged parties in their contempt for Bertie by forcing them so spend the night outside and then in their collective amusement by finding the keys just after Bertie left, thus making his journey pointless. Though tired and aching, Bertie cannot argue with the results. Jeeves then says that he accidentally burned Bertie's mess jacket. Bertie is incensed, but agrees to let Jeeves have his way."

He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes himwhitewashher fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him smalltrinketsand treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his work, usingreverse psychologyto convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in hisSunday schoolclass for tickets given out for memorizing verses ofScripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prizedBiblefrom the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.

Tom falls in love withBecky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get ""engaged"" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was ""engaged"" to another schoolgirl,Amy Lawrence.

Becky spurns Tom, who accompaniesHuckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform aritualintended to healwarts. At the graveyard, they witness threebody snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter andInjun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potterunconsciousand is thenmurderedby Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear ablood oathnot to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe's claim.

Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson's Island in theMississippi Riverto begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing andpresumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his ownfuneral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing atchurchin the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master'sanatomybook after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting thepunishmentthat would have been hers.

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19686,Crome Yellow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crome_Yellow,"A house party at Crome is viewed largely through the eyes of Denis Stone. Described by his hostess as ""one of our younger poets"", he has been invited by Priscilla and Henry Wimbush to join their summer guests. Denis is secretly in love with their niece, Anne Wimbush, who appears more interested in the artist Gombauld.  The rather naïveflapper, Mary Bracegirdle, decides to embark on an amorous adventure so as to overcome her repressions and makes unsuccessful advances to Denis and Gombauld before falling for the libertine Ivor Lombard one summer night.[a]The hard-of-hearing Jenny Mullion confines most of her thoughts on what goes on to her journal, in which Denis eventually discovers a devastating deconstruction of himself and fellow guests.  Mr. Wimbush, the owner of Crome, has been writing a history of the house and its family, from which he gives two evening readings. His wife is obsessed withalternative spiritualityand finds a fellow sympathiser in the prolific literary hack, Mr. Barbecue-Smith. Also part of the party is Henry's former schoolfriend, the cynical Mr. Scogan, who lies in wait for anyone he can waylay with his reductive criticisms of the time and his visions for adystopianfuture. After several ludicrous failures in trying to capture Anne's affection, Denis despairingly arranges to be recalled home on 'urgent family business' at the very moment when he might have succeeded and departs on the same slow train that had brought him.

Huxley's satire on the fads and fashions of the time is generally based on real places and people. The description of the country house at which the characters gather is recognisably based onGarsington Manor, whileOttoline Morrellhas been taken for the model of Priscilla Wimbush.[7]Scogan has been identified withBertrand Russell,[8]Gombauld withMark Gertler, Mr. Calamy withH. H. Asquith,[9]and Mary Bracegirdle withDora Carrington.[10]Even small comic details sometimes have a foundation in fact, as for example Mrs Bunch's massive consumption of peaches as part of the war effort.Osbert Sitwellclaimed that this was based on an anecdote he had told Huxley about his own father.[11]

Some incidents in the novel allow others to grow out of them. The story of Sir Hercules Lapith, Henry Wimbush's predecessor at Crome, has imbedded within it some 64 lines in Augustanheroic couplets, far longer than all the parodies of modern verse in the book. Its function is to give an insight into its author’s motives for creating his alternative society for dwarfs at his home. At the same time it is a parody within a parody, since it appears as part Sir Henry's modern-day history of the house, itself a narrative within the main narrative.

Scogan's withering sketch of the contemporary novel whose subject is a sensitive young man’s development so appalls Denis Stone that he destroys the first two chapters of the novel he has brought with him to continue at Crome. On the one hand this may have been directed atJames Joyce'sPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which had been published in the previous decade. But it has also been conjectured thatCrome Yellowitself is a parody of the sort of novel Denis is dissuaded from continuing.[12]Here too the comparatively recent past model encapsulates the present text.

Conversely, a future text is prefigured in Scogan's prophecy of the ""impersonal generation"" that will ""take the place of Nature's hideous system"" by raising its children in incubators. ""The family system will disappear; society, sapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations; and Eros, beautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world."" It is an idea that Huxley would revisit at greater length inBrave New World(1932), but by that time he had passed from satirising the self-absorption and consequent lack of a vision of a positive way forward following the destructive barbarism of theFirst World War[13]to examining aspects of the failure of humanity manifested in that war and its inevitable result in the 'Rational State' that Scogan proposes.[14]

He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes himwhitewashher fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him smalltrinketsand treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his work, usingreverse psychologyto convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in hisSunday schoolclass for tickets given out for memorizing verses ofScripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prizedBiblefrom the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.

Tom falls in love withBecky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get ""engaged"" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was ""engaged"" to another schoolgirl,Amy Lawrence.

Becky spurns Tom, who accompaniesHuckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform aritualintended to healwarts. At the graveyard, they witness threebody snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter andInjun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potterunconsciousand is thenmurderedby Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear ablood oathnot to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe's claim.

Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson's Island in theMississippi Riverto begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing andpresumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his ownfuneral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing atchurchin the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master'sanatomybook after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting thepunishmentthat would have been hers.

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9611,"Joseph Andrews, Vol. 1",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Andrews,"The novel begins with the affable, intrusive narrator outlining the nature of our hero. Joseph Andrews is the brother of Richardson's Pamela and is of the same rustic parentage and patchy ancestry. At the age of 10, he found himself tending animals as an apprentice to Sir Thomas Booby. In proving his worth as a horseman, he caught the eye of Sir Thomas's wife, Lady Booby, who now employs him (age 17) as her footman.

After Sir Thomas's death, Joseph finds his Lady's affections redoubled as she offers herself to him in her chamber while on a trip to London. In a scene analogous to many of Pamela's refusals of Mr. B in Richardson's novel, Lady Booby finds Joseph's Christian commitment to pre-maritalchastityunwavering. After suffering the Lady's fury, Joseph sends a letter to his sister much like Pamela's anguished missives in her own novel. The Lady makes one last attempt at seduction before dismissing him from both his job and his lodgings.

As Joseph sets out from London by moonlight, the narrator introduces the novel's heroine, Fanny Goodwill, Joseph's true love. A poor, illiterate girl of 'extraordinary beauty' (I, xi), now living with a farmer close to Lady Booby's parish, she and Joseph had grown ever closer since their childhood, before their local parson and mentor Abraham Adams recommended that they postpone marriage until they have the means to live comfortably.

On his way to see Fanny, Joseph is mugged and laid up in a nearby inn where, by coincidence, he is reunited with Parson Adams, who is on his way to London to sell three volumes of his sermons. The thief is found and brought to the inn (only to escape later that night), and Joseph is reunited with his possessions. Adams and Joseph catch up with each other, and the parson, in spite of his own poverty, offers his last9s 3½dto Joseph's disposal.

Joseph and Adams's stay in the inn is capped by one of many burlesque,slapstickdigressions in the novel. Betty, the inn's 21-year-oldchambermaid, had taken a liking to Joseph, but is doomed to disappointment by Joseph's constancy to Fanny. The landlord, Mr. Tow-wouse, who had always admired Betty, saw this disappointment as an opportunity to take advantage. Locked in an embrace, they are discovered by the choleric Mrs. Tow-wouse, who chases the maid through the house until Adams restrains her. With the landlord promising not to transgress again, his lady allows him to make his peace at the cost of ""quietly and contentedly bearing to be reminded of his transgressions, as a kind of penance, once or twice a day, during the residue of his life"" (I, xviii).

During his stay in the inn, Adams's hopes for his sermons are mocked in a discussion with a travelling bookseller and another parson. Nevertheless, Adams remains resolved to continue his journey to London until it is revealed that his wife, deciding that he would be more in need of shirts than sermons on his journey, has neglected to pack them. The pair thus decide to return to the parson's parish: Joseph in search of Fanny, and Adams in search of his sermons.

With Joseph following on horseback, Adams finds himself sharing a stage coach with an anonymous lady and Madam Slipslop, an admirer of Joseph's and a servant of Lady Booby. When they pass the house of a teenage girl named Leonora, the anonymous lady is reminded of a story and begins one of the novel's three interpolated tales, ""The History of Leonora, or the Unfortunate Jilt"". This continues for a number of chapters, punctuated by the questions and interruptions of the other passengers.

After stopping at an inn, Adams relinquishes his seat to Joseph, and forgetting his horse, sets out ahead on foot. Finding himself some time ahead of his friend, Adams rests by the side of the road where he becomes so engaged in conversation with a fellow traveller that he misses the stage coach as it passes. As the night falls and Adams and the stranger discourse on courage and duty, a shriek is heard. The stranger, having seconds earlier lauded the virtues of bravery and chivalry, makes his excuses and flees the scene without turning back. Adams, however, rushes to the girl's aid and after amock-epicstruggle knocks her attacker unconscious. In spite of Adams's good intentions, he and the girl, who reveals herself to be none other than Fanny Goodwill (in search of Joseph after hearing of his mugging), find themselves accused of assault and robbery.

After some comic litigious wrangling before the local magistrate, the pair are eventually released and depart shortly after midnight in search of Joseph. They do not have to walk far before a storm forces them into the same inn that Joseph and Slipslop have chosen for the night. Slipslop, her jealousy ignited by seeing the two lovers reunited, departs angrily. When Adams, Joseph and Fanny come to leave the following morning, they find their departure delayed by an inability to settle the bill, and, with Adams's solicitations of a loan from the local parson and his wealthy parishioners failing, it falls on a local peddler to rescue the trio by loaning them his last6s 6d.

The solicitations of charity that Adams is forced to make, and the complications which surround their stay in the parish, bring him into contact with many localsquires, gentlemen and parsons, and much of the latter part of Book II is taken up by discussions of literature, religion, philosophy and trade that result.

The three depart the inn by night, and it is not long before Fanny needs to rest. With the party silent, they overhear approaching voices agree on ""the murder of any one they meet"" (III, ii) and flee to a local house. Inviting them in, the owner, Mr. Wilson, informs them that the gang of supposed murderers were in fact sheep-stealers, intent more on the killing of livestock than of Adams and his friends. The party being settled, Wilson begins the novel's most lengthy interpolated tale by recounting his life story; a story which bears a notable resemblance to Fielding's own youth.

At the age of 16, Wilson's father died and left him a modest fortune. Finding himself the master of his destiny, he left school and travelled to London where he soon acquainted himself with the dress, manners and reputation for womanising necessary to consider himself a ""beau"". Wilson's life in the town is a façade: he writes love-letters to himself, obtains his fine clothes on credit, and is concerned more to be seen at the theatre than to watch the play. After two bad experiences with women, he is financially crippled, and much like Fielding, falls into the company of a group ofDeists,freethinkersand gamblers. Finding himself in debt, he, like Fielding, turns to the writing of plays andhack journalismto alleviate his financial problems. He spends his last few pence on a lottery ticket, but with no reliable income, is soon forced to exchange it for food. While in jail for his debts, news reaches him that the ticket he gave away has won a £3,000 prize. His disappointment is short-lived, however, as the daughter of the winner hears of his plight, pays off his debts, and, after a brief courtship, agrees to marry him.

Wilson found himself at the mercy of many of the social ills that Fielding had written about in his journalism: the over-saturated and abused literary market, the exploitative state lottery, and regressive laws which sanctioned imprisonment for small debts. Having seen the corrupting influence of wealth and the town, he retires with his new wife to the rural solitude in which Adams, Fanny and Joseph find them. The only break in his contentment, and one which turns out to be significant to the plot, was the kidnapping of his eldest son, whom he has not seen since.

Wilson promises to visit Adams when he passes through his parish, and after another mock-epic battle on the road, this time with a party ofhunting dogs, the trio proceed to the house of a local squire, where Fielding illustrates another contemporary social ill by having Adams subjected to a humiliatingroasting. Enraged, the three depart to the nearest inn to find that, while at the squire's house, they had been robbed of their lasthalf-guinea. To compound their misery, the squire has Adams and Joseph accused of kidnapping Fanny, to have them detained while he orders the abduction of the girl himself. She is rescued in transit, however, by Lady Booby's steward, Peter Pounce, and all four of them complete the remainder of the journey to Booby Hall together.

On seeing Joseph arrive back in the parish, a jealous Lady Booby meanders through emotions as diverse as rage, pity, hatred, pride and love. The next morning Joseph and Fanny'sbanns are publishedand the Lady turns her anger onto Parson Adams, who is accommodating Fanny at his house. Finding herself powerless either to stop the marriage or to expel them from the parish, she enlists the help of Lawyer Scout, who brings a spurious charge of larceny against Joseph and Fanny to prevent, or at least postpone the wedding.

Three days later, the Lady's plans are foiled by the visit of her nephew, Mr Booby, and a surprise guest: Booby has married Pamela, granting Joseph a powerful new ally and brother-in-law. What is more, Booby is an acquaintance of the justice presiding over Joseph and Fanny's trial, and instead ofBridewell, has them committed to his own custody. Knowing of his sister's antipathy to the two lovers, Booby offers to reunite Joseph with his sister and take him and Fanny into his own parish and his own family.

In a discourse with Joseph onstoicismandfatalism, Adams instructs his friend to submit to the will of God and control his passions, even in the face of overwhelming tragedy. In the kind of crueljuxtapositionusually reserved for Fielding's less savoury characters, Adams is informed that his youngest son, Jacky, has drowned. After indulging his grief in a manner contrary to his lecture a few minutes previously, Adams is informed that the report was premature, and that his son has in fact been rescued by the same peddler that loaned him his last few shillings in Book II.

Lady Booby, in a last-ditch attempt to sabotage the marriage, brings a young beau named Didapper to Adams's house to seduce Fanny. Fanny is unmoved by his bold attempts at courtship. Didapper is too bold in his approach and provokes Joseph into a fight. The Lady and the beau depart in disgust, but the peddler, having seen the Lady, is compelled to relate a tale. The peddler had met his wife while in the army, and she died young. While on her death bed, she confessed that she once stole an exquisitely beautiful baby girl from a family named Andrews, and sold her on to Sir Thomas Booby, thus raising the possibility that Fanny may in fact be Joseph's sister. The company is shocked, but there is general relief that the crime of incest may have been narrowly averted.

The following morning, Joseph and Pamela's parents arrive, and together with the peddler and Adams, they piece together the question of Fanny's parentage. The Andrews identify her as their lost daughter, but have a twist to add to the tale. When Fanny was an infant, she was indeed stolen from her parents, but the thieves left behind a sickly infant Joseph in return, who was raised as their own. It is immediately apparent that Joseph is the above-mentioned kidnapped son of Wilson, and when Wilson arrives on his promised visit, he identifies Joseph by abirthmarkon his chest. Joseph is now the son of a respected gentleman, Fanny an in-law of the Booby family, and the couple no longer suspected of being siblings. Two days later they are married by Adams in a humble ceremony, and the narrator, after bringing the story to a close, and in a disparaging allusion to Richardson, reassures readers that there will be no sequel.

Joseph Andrews, a stage adaptation of the first and fourth books of the novel, was written bySamuel Jackson Prattand performed on 20 April 1778 at theTheatre Royal, Drury Lane. The role of Fanny was played byMary Robinson.[1]

The novel wasadapted for the screenin 1977 byTony Richardson,Allan ScottandChris Bryant. Richardson directed the critically well-received work, withMichael Hordernas Adams,Peter Firthas Joseph, and Lady Booby played bySwedish-bornAnn-Margret, who received aGolden Globenomination for the role. The tag line (""The story of a young, English footman who served the Lady Booby but loved the little Fanny"") suggests how it captures some of the source material's bawdy humour. It was released onregion 1DVD in 2003.

A four-part radio adaption dramatised by John Scotney was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in April 1986.

A two-part adaptation,Joseph Andrews Remixed, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in July 2021. It was written by Shaun McKenna and incorporated a fictionalization of Fielding writing the novel with the help of his wife whilst the couple struggled for money in fear of retribution for some of Fielding's anonymous satires against the Tory government.

One day, chasing an escaped hen, Garnet tumbles into a garden where he stumbles upon Phyllis, the girl from the train, her father Professor Derrick, and a friendly young navy lieutenant namedTom Chase, whose familiarity with Phyllis irks Garnet. They recapture the chicken, and Garnet is invited to lunch, stays to playcroquetafterwards, and his love for Phyllis is sealed.

Soon the Ukridges invite their new neighbours over for dinner, but the cat gets stuck up the chimney and they are unable to cook. Fed cold food, and upset by Ukridge's small talk, especially on the topic ofIrish Home Rule, the Professor storms out, and Garnet finds himself in his beloved's father's bad books.

The chickens become ill, and Garnet, on his way to fetch help, runs into Phyllis, who shows him some friendliness. Later, bathing at the beach, he spies the Professor, fishing from a boat. He hatches a plan, bribes a local,Harry Hawk, to upset the Professor's boat, and saves him from the sea, restoring the man's faith in him. He visits Phyllis, but is interrupted in his wooing by Chase, who hints that he is wise to Garnet's boat plot, and thrashes Garnet at tennis.

With the chicken farm struggling, a local informs Derrick of Garnet's boat plot, and he finds himself once again despised. He buries himself in the farm and his writing, but after a week he comes across Phyillis alone, and explains his actions to her. He declares his love, and she returns it, revealing that Chase is in fact engaged to her sister Norah, but adds that her father, loathing Garnet, would never consent to them marrying. On Ukridge's advice, they beard the man in the sea, and Garnet announces his love for Phyllis, but only makes Derrick angrier.

Garnet finds himself up against the Professor in the final of a local golf tournament, which, he has learned, the Professor has long been desperate to win. He plays a bad game, and wins the Professor round, giving him the match but winning his consent. Returning to the farm, he finds that the Ukridges have disappeared, apparently bolted to London to flee their creditors.

A swarm of said creditors arrive, and begin ransacking the farm; they have turned to the chickens when Ukridge returns, bearing wealth courtesy of Millie'sAunt Elizabeth. He berates the assembled throng, and sends them off with fleas in their ears. Later, Garnet finds Ukridge on the beach, and hears of his plan – to start up a duck farm...

The first UK edition of the book, published June 1906, featured three illustrations and a frontispiece byH. M.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21157,Queen Lucia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Lucia,"Emmeline Lucas is the social queen of Riseholme, presiding over her community and directing their interests in art and culture. A pretentious show-off,La Luciadrops random Italian phrases into her speech, gives concerts to her friends of the first movement ofBeethoven'sMoonlight Sonata, dabbles in art, and plantsShakespeare-themed flower arrangements in her garden. Her neighbor, devotedfaddistDaisy Quantock, has given up her uric-acid-free diet andChristian Scienceto focus on Indian mysticism, thanks to a mysteriousguruwho shows up at her door and offers to show her the Way. Lucia must decide how to annex the guru, and turn this into a social success for herself. Daisy then brings in a Russian medium, Princess Popoffski. Lucia has a harder time whenoperadiva Olga Bracely arrives in Riseholme for a visit, luring away Lucia's devoted friend Georgie Pillson.

Benson based the character of Lucia on his sometime-friendMarie Corelli, a best-selling novelist. Corelli pretended to speak Italian, talked baby-talk with men, held piano concerts, and upheld the values and reputation of Shakespeare. Masters writes, ""Marie Corelli was a monster of pretension who would have ruled the lives and manners ofStratfordpeople given half a chance, and Fred [Benson] pounced upon her every weakness with victorious glee, distilling them all into the awesome Lucia.""[3]

Benson's 1916 book of short stories,The Freaks of Mayfair, informed his characters inQueen Lucia. ""These include the effeminate bachelor, Aunt Georgie, who, with his music, embroidery, and hair dye, is clearly the ancestor of the much more sympathetically rendered Georgie Pillson, and Mrs. Weston, whose dabblings inyoga,Christian Science,spiritualism, andhealth foodanticipate Daisy Quantock's obsession with fads.""[2]

A contemporary review inThe Bookmansays, ""This is decidedly one of the most amazing and clever stories that Mr. Benson has written. It is a kind of cleverness which is familiar in fiction as well as in social intercourse, an unfeeling smartness which is satirical and sarcastic. Modern society, especially in the case of idle rich people, must be a constant temptation to the clever novelist, and Mr. Benson has alreaady shot his arrows at the crazes of society women in particular. But in this novel he is genial and delightful. There is no acid touch of superiority.""[5]

Another contemporary review inThe Literary Digestsays, ""The book is lacking in what we are constantly told is necessary for a good novel. There is not much plot; there is no love interest; there is no climax — the book just stops (much to our regret) after chronicling one more Riseholme failure in the line of spirit manifestation. But it is long since once has seen such a masterly bit of satire, such a piece of character-study as Lucia.""[6]

Robert Kiernan writes that the Lucia novels ""constitute a high point of camp...Queen Luciais a comedy of village manners, with a line clearly drawn between insiders and outsiders. References toBolshevismand revolutionary outrages may seem to suggest that Riseholme is something more than a village — a microcosm, even, of beleaguered monarchies the world over — but one is never permitted to take that seriously that analogy. Indeed, Riseholme is a stage set, not a sociopolitical entity.""[1]

Benson wrote another book about a socially-striving heroine,Miss Mapp, in 1922. His second Lucia novel,Lucia in London, was published in 1927. He combined the two characters inMapp and Lucia(1931), as Lucia and Georgie leave Riseholme to take up lodgings in Mapp's fictional seaside town,Tilling. She remains there for another two books,Lucia's Progress(1935, published in the US asThe Worshipful Lucia), andTrouble for Lucia(1939).[1]

TheMapp and Luciaseries has been adapted for television twice, in a1985 seriesoriginally aired onChannel 4, and a2014 seriesonBBC One. While both adaptations begin with Lucia visiting Tilling (the beginning of the fourth book), the 2014 series adapted the Indian guru sequence fromQueen Lucia, transposing the guru's host from Daisy Quantock to Diva Plaistow."

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26228,Candide,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide,"Candidecontains thirtyepisodicchapters, which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist'shiatusinEl Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, the first half ofCandideconstitutes therising actionand the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure andpicaresquenovels, which tend to employ such adramatic structure.[45]By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in theAmericas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and theOttoman Empire.[46][47]The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.

The tale ofCandidebegins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh inWestphalia, home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cunégonde; hisbastardnephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; achambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. Theprotagonist, Candide, is romantically attracted to Cunégonde. He is a young man of ""the most unaffected simplicity"" (l'esprit le plus simple), whose face is ""the true index of his mind"" (sa physionomie annonçait son âme).[2]Dr. Pangloss, professor of ""métaphysico-théologo-cosmolonigologie"" (English: ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"") and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the ""best of all possible worlds"" and that ""all is for the best"".

All is well in the castle until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured byBulgar(Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he isflogged, nearlyexecuted, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (anallegoryrepresenting the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, anAnabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar withsyphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cunégonde wasrapedbefore her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail toLisbon.

In Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard.[48]The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the ""brutish sailor"" who let Jacques drown[49]survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit byan earthquake, tsunami, and firethat kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.

The next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of thePortuguese Inquisition, and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an ""auto-da-fé"" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman,[50]who leads him to a house where Lady Cunégonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cunégonde had been raped anddisemboweled. She had been, but Cunégonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corruptGrand Inquisitorinto sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cunégonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and thesabbath day). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas.[51]Along the way, Cunégonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her.

The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter ofPope Urban Xand the Princess ofPalestrina, she was kidnapped and enslaved byBarbary pirates, witnessed violent civil wars inMoroccounder the bloodthirsty kingMoulay Ismaïl(during which her mother wasdrawn and quartered), suffered constant hunger, nearly died from aplagueinAlgiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starvingJanissariesduring theRussian capture of Azov. After traversing all theRussian Empire, she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cunégonde.

The trio arrives inBuenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, analcalde(a Spanish magistrate) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees toParaguaywith his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.

At aborder poston the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to thecommandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, theJesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order.[51]When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with hisrapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.

Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of theIncanobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.[52]

After a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander intoEl Dorado, a geographically isolatedutopiawhere the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny.[53]Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.

Candide and Cacambo eventually reachSurinamewhere they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.

This companion, Martin, is aManichaeanscholarbased on the real-life pessimistPierre Bayle, who was a chief opponent of Leibniz.[54]For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour toBordeauxandParis, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based onAdmiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time ""pour encourager les autres"" (to encourage the others).[55]Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival inVenice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with aTheatinemonk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object since she was forced to become a prostitute, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousandpiastresto Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.

Candide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo—now a slave—arrives and informs Candide that Cunégonde is inConstantinople. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for theCarnival of Venice. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman SultanAhmed III, EmperorIvan VI of Russia,Charles Edward Stuart(an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne),Augustus III of Poland(deprived, at the time of writing, of his reign in theElectorate of Saxonydue to theSeven Years' War),Stanisław Leszczyński, andTheodore of Corsica.

On the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes on the banks of thePropontisas a slave for a fugitiveTransylvanianprince by the name ofRákóczi. After arriving at theBosphorus, they board agalleywhere, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices.[51]They both relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: ""I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and sincepre-established harmonyis the most beautiful thing in the world, along with theplenumandsubtle matter.""[56]

Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm (une petite métairie) which he just bought with the last of his finances.

One day, the protagonists seek out adervishknown as a great philosopher of the land. Candide asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Candide is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet aTurkwhose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them ""free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.""[57]Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this ""commendable plan"" (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him ""we must cultivate our garden"" (il faut cultiver notre jardin).[57]

As Voltaire himself described it, the purpose ofCandidewas to ""bring amusement to a small number of men of wit"".[2]The author achieves this goal by combining wit with a parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death ""as coolly as a weather report"".[58]The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again.[59]In the end,Candideis primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, ""short, light, rapid and humorous"".[10][60]

Behind the playful façade ofCandidewhich has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for theirInquisition, and the British for the execution ofJohn Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated inCandide. For example, Voltaire mocks theJesuit orderof theRoman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while inParaguay, Cacambo remarks, ""[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all …"". Here, Voltaire suggests theChristian mission in Paraguayis taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.[61][62]

The main method ofCandide's satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy.[10]The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.[59]ThusCandidederides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.[2][58]

A simple example of the satire ofCandideis seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin inPortsmouthharbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to representJohn Byng, being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely ""to encourage the others"" (French:pour encourager les autres, an expression Voltaire is credited with originating). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation ""to encourage the others"" thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted fromCandide.[10][63]

Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all ofCandideis a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode ofEl Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.[2][58]

Another element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works onCandide, calls the ""sentimental foibles of the age"" and Voltaire's attack on them.[64]Flaws in European culture are highlighted asCandideparodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking the style of apicaresque novel.[64][65]A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the driftingrogueof lowsocial class, Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor, and Cacambo the skillful valet.[2]As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters ofCandideare unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and evenmarionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical.[66]As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is abildungsroman, if not a very serious one.[2][67]

Gardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role inCandide. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion asAdam and Eveare evicted from theGarden of Edenin theBook of Genesis. Cyclically, the main characters ofCandideconclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent ""garden"" isEl Dorado, which may be a false Eden.[68]Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.[69]

These gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to theEncyclopédie, and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate ""his garden"" symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported theEncyclopédie: the main characters ofCandidelive in seclusion to ""cultivate [their] garden"", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in theepistolarycorrespondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing theEncyclopédie.[69]Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating ""his garden"" suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates inLes DélicesandFerney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.[70][71][72]

Candidesatirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these isLeibnizian optimism(sometimes calledPanglossianismafter its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity.[10]Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil—specifically the theological problem of
its existence—is the focus of the work.[73]Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder—evils of human design—are explored as extensively inCandideas are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is ""comprehensive"" in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.[74]

Fundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:"

Hadleyburg enjoys the reputation of being an ""incorruptible"" town known for its responsible, honest people who are trained to avoidtemptation. However, at some point the people of Hadleyburg manage to offend a passing stranger, and he vows to get his revenge by corrupting the town.

The stranger drops off a sack in Hadleyburg, at the house of Edward and Mary Richards. It contains slightly over 160 pounds of gold coins and is to be given to a man in the town who purportedly gave the stranger $20 and some life-changing advice in his time of need years earlier. To identify the man, a letter with the sack suggests that anyone who claims to know what the advice was should write the remark down and submit it toReverendBurgess, who will open the sack at a public meeting and find the actual remark inside. News of the mysterious sack of gold, whose value is estimated at $40,000, spreads throughout the town and even gains attention across the country.

Chapter II

The residents beam withprideas stories of the sack and Hadleyburg's honesty spread throughout the nation, but the mood soon changes. Initially reluctant to give in to the temptation of the gold, soon even the most upstanding citizens are trying to guess the remark.

Edward and Mary, one of the town's nineteen model couples, receive a letter from a stranger revealing the remark: ""You are far from being a bad man: go, and reform."" Mary is ecstatic that they will be able to claim the gold. Unbeknownst to one another, all nineteen couples have received identical letters. They submit their claims to Burgess and begin to recklessly purchase things on credit in anticipation of their future wealth.

Chapter III

To decide who the rightful owner of the gold is the townspeople hold a meeting in the town hall, which is packed with residents, outsiders, and reporters. Burgess reads the first two claims, and a dispute quickly arises between two townspeople who have submitted nearly the same remark. To settle which is right, Burgess cuts open the sack and finds the note that reveals the full remark: ""You are far from being a bad man—go, and reform—or, mark my words—some day, for yoursinsyou will die and go tohellor Hadleyburg—try and make it the former."" Neither man's claim includes the entire remark.

The next claim reads the same, and the town hall bursts into laughter at the obviousdishonestybehind the incorrect claims. Burgess continues to read the rest of the claims, all with the same (partial) remark, and one by one the prominent couples of the town are publicly shamed. Edward and Mary await their name with anguish, but surprisingly it is never read.

With all the claims presented, another note in the sack is opened. It reveals that the stranger fabricated the entire scenario in order to avenge himself for the offense he suffered while traveling through Hadleyburg. He says that it was foolish for the citizens to always avoid temptation, because it is easy to corrupt those who have never had their resolve tested. Burgess discovers that the sack contains not gold but gilded lead pieces. A townsperson proposes to auction the lead off and give the money to Edward and Mary, the only prominent couple in town that did not have their name read off. Edward and Mary are indespair, unsure whether to come clean and stop the auction or to accept the money. The stranger who set up the scheme is revealed to have been in the town hall the whole time. He wins the auction, then makes a deal to sell the sack to one of the townspeople for $40,000 and give $10,000 of that money to Edward and Mary. He gives them $1,500 cash at the meeting and promises to deliver the remaining $8,500 the next morning, once his buyer has paid him.

Chapter IV

The following day the stranger delivers checks totaling $38,500 to Edward and Mary - the remainder of the $40,000 selling price. Mary recognizes him as the man who dropped off the sack. As they fret over whether they should burn the checks, they find a note from the stranger explaining that he thought all nineteen model couples would fall to temptation; since Edward and Mary have remained honest, he is giving them all the money. A second message arrives from Burgess, explaining that he intentionally kept the Richardses' claim from being read as a way to return an old favor Edward had done for him. The buyer has the fake gold coins stamped with a message mocking his political rival and distributes them throughout the town, allowing him to win an election for a seat in the state legislature.

Edward and Mary become distraught over their situation, growingparanoidand starting to think Burgess has revealed their dishonesty to other people in the town. Theiranxietycauses them both to fall ill, and Edward confesses theirguiltshortly before he and Mary die. The checks are never cashed. With its reputation irreparably damaged, Hadleyburg decides to rename itself and remove one word from its official motto (originally ""Lead Us Not Into Temptation"" to ""Lead Us Into Temptation""). The story ends with the comment, ""It is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early that catches it napping again.""

The story was adapted into a 39-minute television film as part of thePBSAmerican Short Storiesseries, directed by Ralph Rosenblum and featuring performances byRobert Preston,Fred Gwynne, andFrances Sternhagen.  It first aired on March 17, 1980.  The ending is both altered and shortened for the film. A DVD version was released byMonterey Mediaon  November 16, 2004.

A radio adaptation of the story was featured on theCBS Radio Mystery Theateron January 9, 1976, starring Fred Gwynne andEarl Hammond.[3]

Another adaptation of the story, featuring the Persky Ridge Players and filmed at a theater in Glasgow,Montana, had a VHS release on October 2, 2000.

TheJiangsu Huai Operabased their opera, entitled The Small Town, on the story. The opera is directed by Lu Ang, written by Xu Xinhua, and stars award-winning actors Chen Mingkuang and Chen Cheng in lead. After a two-year tour of China, the company is set to perform the piece around Europe in 2019.[4]

Twain had given a lecture in a church atOberlin Collegein 1885, and it was unpopular with the academic audience. The Hadleyburg story may allude to this event. ScholarRussel B. Nyewrote that the story ""was Twain's way of taking revenge on the small town"" after being jeered at and rejected by the academic audience.[5]Writes Nye, ""the story is coexistent with the publication of Twain's tale of exposed hypocrisy, the townspeople remembering his visit and noting the parallel situations. There are some interesting and provocative parallels between Twain's Oberlin experiences and the Hadleyburg of fiction"". The town of Oberlin had been founded as a religious and educational settlement in 1833, and is and was known as an educational and religious center. Nye says that Twain read three stories that were received coolly by most of his Oberlin audience:  ""King Solomon"" (an excerpt fromHuckleberry Finn,ch. 14); ""The Tragic Tale of a Fishwife,"" an excerpt fromA Tramp Abroad; and ""A Trying Situation.""  The fishwife tale is from Appendix D inA Tramp Abroad, subtitled ""The Awful German Language.""

Twain lived in Austria from 1897 to 1899.John Sutton Tuckeywrote inMark Twain and Little Satanthat ""The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg"" (together with the ""Eseldorf"" version ofThe Mysterious Strangerand ""Stirring Times in Austria"") ""all had a common origin in Twain's response to the events of his first two months in Vienna—particularly those that occurred on the floor of the Imperial Parliament"".[6]What is meant areparliamentobstructions and riots following the adoption ofBadeni language laws."

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21816,The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Confidence-Man,"The novel's title refers to its central character, an ambiguous figure. He sneaks aboard a Mississippi steamboat onApril Fool's Day. This stranger attempts to test the confidence of the passengers. Their varied reactions constitute the bulk of the text, which is formatted in a series of vignettes. While the vignettes do not build on each other, they do allude to each other. Each person is forced to confront the placement of his trust. The entire novel takes place over the course of one day.[24]

In the first chapter, adeaf-muteman writes quotes from the Bible about charity on a sign, to the skepticism of the crowd. A black man named Guinea begs for money, and a man accuses him of being neither black nor disabled. A man with a weed in his hat named John Ringman tells Mr. Roberts that they have met before; Roberts insists that they have not. Ringman recounts his troubled life to Roberts, and notes that they are bothmasons. Roberts gives Ringman some money in sympathy. A man in a grey coat convinces a young clergyman to give him money to give to Guinea. Encourged, the man in the grey coat asks him for a donation to a charity for widows and orphans, which he receives. He asks more passengers to donate to the charity, with some success.

After being warned that he could be swindled by a man in a cap, a young college student buys stock in Black Rapid Coal Company from John Ringman. The man in the cap convinces Roberts to buy stock in the Black Rapid Coal Company. An unnamed narrator relates how Ringman lost a wife and child and is now raising money to get custody of his daughter, which makes Roberts and the man in a cap sympathetic to him. The narrator states that authors should write their characters consistently, even though in reality, people are inconsistent. As payment for bringing him water, the man in the cap asks the miser for confidence to invest his money, which claims that he can triple. The miser gives him one hundred dollars, and the man in the cap leaves.

A sick man strikes up a conversation with an herb doctor, who sells him medicine. The herb doctor sells liniment to Thomas Fry, an injured soldier and to the miser, after reporting to the miser that he just saw the man in the cap debark. The Missourian, Pitch, warns the miser that the medicine won't work, and they debate the merits of ""natural"" illness, remedies, and disasters. The herb doctor overhears and fails to convince Pitch of his sincerity. Pitch strikes up a conversation with the round-backed man, who claims that he works at an employment agency and convinces him to hire a boy. Afterwards, he talks to the cosmopolitan Frank Goodman and rebuffs his offer of friendship.

Charlie Noble, a stranger from the West, tells Goodman that Pitch reminds him of Moredock, a famed Indian-hater. Noble tells Goodman how John Moredock, after Indians kill his mother, kills many Indians in revenge. Despite being a murderer, Moredock was a devoted husband and father and otherwise likeable. Goodman finds this hard to believe, and asks Noble to be charitable when judging Pitch. Goodman and Noble become friends, and they drink together. After Goodman asks Noble for a loan, Noble almost leaves, but Goodman performs a rite and commands him to return. Noble concludes that Goodman's request for money was an ""absurd story."" The unnamed narrator tells the reader his theories about the importance of reality in fiction.

Mark Winsom, a mystic, warns Goodman that Noble is not trustworthy. Winsom's disciple, Egbert, meets Goodman. Egbert tells Goodman that lending him money would ruin their friendship; Goodman wants the loan to test their friendship. Goodman goes to the barbershop, where ""no trust"" is displayed prominently. Goodman tells the barber that he should trust, and tells the barber he will cover any debts the barber incurs for trusting. The barber wants to have a written contract, so Goodman walks away without paying for his shave. An old man has Goodman read from the Bible to him, and Goodman reads quotes about how we should be distrustful. The old man says these words are from theapocrypha, so they aren't true. The old man buys a lock for his door to guard against thieves while Goodman leads him to his room.

According to biographer Delbanco, critics were ""baffled"" byThe Confidence-Man, and some reviews were ""vicious"".[22]Whereas reviews ofMoby-Dickelicited responses from Melville and caused him insecurity about the popularity of his writing, reviews ofThe Confidence-Manhad less impact on him. After completing the manuscript, Melville had already decided to stop writing novels. Reviews from London, England were, according to the editors of the Norton Critical Edition ofThe Confidence-Man, of ""more historical significance"" than the American reviews.[25]A recent discovery of three more American reviews found that at least some American reviewers consideredThe Confidence-Manwith more ""serious attention.""[26]Contemporary reviewers described the style as ""controlled, vivid, extraordinarily powerful, graphic, fresh, and entertaining"" while being oblivious to the novel's critiques of Christianity.[27]

Multiple American newspapers gave reviews of the novel, although notably,Harper'sdid not review the novel.[28]North American and United States Gazettecalled it ""a sketchy affair"" with occasional humor that peeks out ""though buried under quite too many words.""[29]TheEvening Transcriptfrom Boston praised Melville's treatment of the archetypal confidence man and described Melville as dealing ""equally well in the material description and the metaphysical insight of human life.""[30]Boston'sDaily Timeswas less generous, calling it ""ineffably meaningless and trashy.""[31]In Maine: ""We have found it hard reading.""[32]In the recently-discovered longer reviews, theTroy Daily Whigfound how Melville puts the confidence man on display ""entirely original"". TheBangor Daily Whigin Maine wrote that the novel ""has a good deal of sound philosophy in it, but some of the incidents of humbuggery."" The monthly newspaperUnited States Journalacknowledged the craftsmanship of the novel, but was highly critical of it, calling it a ""desecration of the fine talents and affluent genius of the author. [...] Satire that has no mellowness is inhuman; we are made worse rather than better from it.""[26]

Reviews from London were more in-depth and saw Melville's change in style as a sign of his development as an author, while being conscious of the book's flaws.[33]Elizabeth Foster attributes England's interest to the book's ""sharp satire on the American scene.""[34]TheAthenaeumcalled the novel a ""moralmiracle-play"" for its focus on how various characters interact in dialogue with the confidence man, either as credulous dupes or would-be followers. They acknowledged that Melville's style is ""one, from its peculiarities, difficult to manage"" but that he ""pours his colours over the narration with discretion as well a prodigality"", concluding that the novel was ""invariably graphic, fresh, and entertaining.""[35]London'sLeaderdescribed Melville's style as full of ""festoons of exuberant fancy"" interspersed with descriptions of the American steamboat and surrounding landscape. They praised Melville's use of satire, and criticized his habit of ""discours[ing] upon too large a scale"" and keeping his characters too rigid.[36]A review fromLiterary Gazettewas not as generous and described the book not as a novel, but as a series of forty-five conversations, which ""so far resembling the Dialogues of Plato as to be undoubted Greek to ordinary men."" The review continued to criticize the style as long-winded and obscure. They conceded that ""this caldron, so thick and slab with nonsense, often bursts into the bright, brief bubbles of fancy and wit"" and concluded that the book was ruined with ""strained effort after excessive originality.""[37]A review atSpectatordid not appreciate the ""local allusions"" in the work, and found the satirical style to be ""drawn from the European writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with some of Mr. Melville's own Old World observations superadded.""[38]Foster noticed that many contemporary reviewers failed to realize that the book's overall tone was deeply pessimistic and criticizing Christianity.[28]

Before the 1920s revival of interest in Melville, the novel was only published as part of Melville's complete works and widely considered to be Melville's weakest novel. Later evaluations ofThe Confidence-Manhave been more generous. In 1922,Carl Van Vechtancalled it ""the great satire on Transcendentalism"" and called for its re-examination.[39]In the 1940s, it was the subject of a doctoral dissertation and several shorter academic works.[40]Still, critics in the 1930s through the 1950s found it misanthropic, nihilistic, bitter and cynical.[41]In more recent criticism, American historianWalter A. McDougallwrote that it ""holds up a mirror to the American people"".[42]Melville biographer Delbanco called the book ""a prophetically postmodern work in which swindler cannot be distinguished from swindled and the confidence man tells truth and lies simultaneously"".[42]Writing in theColumbia Literary History of the United States, Robert Milder wrote, ""Long mistaken for a flawed novel, the book is now admired as a masterpiece of irony and control, although it continues to resist interpretive consensus.""[43]

Watson Branch, an associate professor in comparative literature at the University of Cincinnati, divided the structure ofThe Confidence-Maninto four parts: 1) conversations between the six avatars of the Confidence Man and his targets, which result in success or failure; 2) conversations between the cosmopolitan (another avatar) and other steamboat passengers on the topics of friendship and confidence; 3) the frame of the story, consisting of the events at the beginning and end of the novel; and 4) interruptions of various material, including the digressions by the narrator and stories told by passengers, as well as later digressive additions.[44][45]The way the chapters are separated changes halfway through the novel. Whereas in the beginning, each chapter is a contained confidence trick, in chapters 25-41, they are used to heighten drama, sometimes in the middle of a conversation.[46]The majority of the text consists of dialogues between steamboat passengers. At times, Melville includes action that contributes to the reader's understanding of the conversation which expose truths contrary to what the characters are saying, such as when the old miser leans heavily against the herb doctor in chapter 21, provoking the herb doctor to complain that the miser is leaning on him too heavily. Eventually, the Missourian asks the miser to lay in his grave if he can't stand up by himself, exposing the miser's weakness and the herb doctor's hypocrisy.[47]These are interspersed with the insertion of other texts, including essay, short story, an ode, and ""The Metaphysics of Indian-Hating"". Unlike inMoby-Dick, when a central narrator unites disparate accounts, these various genres of texts give multiple perspectives. While Melville authored most of these texts-within-the-text, the Indian-Hating chapters come fromHistory, Life, and Manners, in the WestbyJames Hall. Another story, told by one character (Egbert) in the style of another character (Charlie) comes from a short story Melville had written previously.[48]Branch speculates that the stories are later additions to the initial manuscript, meant to make it longer. As evidence, Branch states that most of the stories are independent of the main narrative. However, the introduction of the stories does allow the novel to explore the connection between fiction and reality, which is more overtly discussed in the three essays on fiction which address the reader directly in chapters 14, 33, and 44.[49]The essays on fiction show Melville reconsidering some of his ideas about fiction. The essay in chapter 33 addresses realism, postulating that it was unnecessary in fiction. The essay in chapter 44 argues that authors do not create original characters most of the time.[50]

As a satire,The Confidence-Mandrew inspiration from British satires likeGulliver's TravelsandThe Citizen of the World. The highly specific chapter titles were a style popular in the 18th century in humorous books likeTom JonesandAmelia. Additionally, the character of the confidence man could be anallegoryfor how theChristian devilworks as the Father of Lies in America, using the imagery of the serpent and Biblical language to make the allegory clear.[51]According to Melville's biographer Hershel Parker, the way that the allegory permeates quotidian conversations makes them significant on ametaphysicallevel.[52]Parker also saw the work as a satire criticizing Americans' willingness to accept that all is well when it is obvious that not all is well.[53]Elizabeth Foster, in her introduction to a 1954 edition, called it a social satire as well as ""a philosophical satire on optimism"" resemblingCandidein its message. However, stylistically, unlikeCandide,The Confidence-Man""is [a satire] of subtle, pervasive, elusive irony, of suggestion and understatement rather than exaggeration, of talk rather than action.""[54]Cook classified the novel as a complexMenippean satire, with a plot that doesn't move forward, but in line with the satire genre, bends back on itself.[55]He identified the scene where Charlie Noble and the Cosmopolitan drink as a ""symposium or drinking party"" which is part of the form of the classical Menippean satire.[56]

Melville scholar Helen Trimpi consideredThe Confidence-Manto be both a political satire and a novelistic adaptation of pantomime andcommedia dell'artepuppetry. In her political reading, Trimpi argues that the titular Confidence-Man is symbolic of theantebellum Republican Party. This identification leads into Trimpi's observation that routinely ""his [the Confidence-Man's] antagonist is a Democrat, Nativist or other opponent of the Republicans"" and the collision of each character's worldview of human nature as good or selfish in the various cons.[57]Trimpi views the thesis of the novel as pleading for moderation on the slavery question for the continuity of the Union.[58]In her view, Melville uses the novel to warn of propaganda's tendency to mold and inflame public opinion, particularly when faced with ""sectional controversy.""[59]Melville's characterization, which uses pantomime archetypes, enables a reading ofThe Confidence-Manwhere ""the premise of the book is that the people in it are all acting out predetermined roles."" This reading also suggests that the novel proposes that ""the world may be a carnival, fair, or Shrovetide masquerade where man himself... passes in parade, always wearing a mask.""[60]In his examination of the novel as satire, Cook also recognized theatrical elements like pantomime, minstrelsy, and farce.[61]

The novel has been interpreted as an allegory similar to Hawthorne's ""The Celestial Railroad,"" drawing on the Christian allegorical tradition shown inThe Pilgrim's Progress. Using Christiantypologicalreading, parts of the narrative in The Confidence Man can be linked to the Bible, The New Testament, and theBook of Revelationin ways that are significant to its narrative. These typological readings usually rely on the division between the first part of the novel, in which the confidence man cons passengers in various disguises, and the second part, in which the Cosmopolitan, another avatar of the confidence man, discusses various topics with other passengers. Viewed through the lens of biblical typology, the first part can represent a focus on Mosaic law, while the second part emphasizes Christian virtues of grace and charity. Thus the entire volume becomes a typological representation of the two Testaments of the Bible. The novel can also be read as a typological representation of the pre- and post-crucifixion portions of the New Testament, with the first part representing Christ's coming to earth, and the second part representing his final weeks. As a typology of the Book of Revelation, the confidence man becomes an antitype of both Christ and Antichrist.[62]

Katie McGettigan, a senior lecturer in American literature atRoyal Holloway, University of Londonwrote a book on Melville andModernity. She argues thatThe Confidence-Manengages with mass-produced text and printing in a way that anticipatesWalter Benjamin'swork on the subject. The novel is modeled after various works that were published in theliterary magazinesof his day. This mass-reproduction of work led to ""the dissolution of the link between authenticity and originality"".[63][64]Rather than a religious allegory, McGettigan sees the book as ""novel and periodical, original and copy, frustrating and pleasurable""—a work that attests to ""the aesthetic power and creative potential of multiplicity.""[65]The resulting work revels in ""the partial, multiple, and modern.""[66]In a book on theater and the Market in America, Jean-Christophe Agnew, an American studies professor at Yale, sawThe Confidence-Manas looking backward and forward likeJanus. The ""corrective criticism"" the novel uses looks back to ancient times, while its aggressive ambiguity looks forward to modernist stances. Melville uses the inherent contradictions of market exchange to ""deconstruct Common Sense, the conventional novel, and, in the end, Melville's own relation to his reader.""[67]

Foster called the character of the Confidence Man ""Melville's most ironic and bitter presentment of his half-mystical apprehension of evil at the heart of things,"" or in other words, the Devil.[68]She noticed that some readers saw the Confidence Man as one man wearing disguises throughout the book, while others thought he was only one of these men. One reviewer saw him as a good person trying to get others to be more trusting, while others saw him as a swindler.[69]Foster's interpretation of the confidence men as various disguises of the Devil, with the novel as religious allegory, has become a standard interpretation of the novel. Critics Leslie Fiedler, Lawrance Thompson, and Malcolm O. Magaw disagree and see the confidence man as a manifestation of God. Quirk disputes either allegoric interpretation, arguing that Melville would be unlikely to use such a consistent device in his fiction, when he usually used his fiction as a mode of philosophical exploration.[70]An article by Jason M. Wirth, a philosophy professor, discusses self inThe Confidence-Man. Wirth interprets the titular character as constantly changing his appearance, which is implied by the subtitle ""His Masquerade"" and the chapter where the narrator disputes the common authorial wisdom that characters should remain consistent. The confidence man takes advantage the uncertainty of who is trustworthy. In finding the method to gain another's confidence, one ""exposes the self's fundamental attachment and commitments"".[71]Still another reading of the eponymous ""confidence man"" is that Melville himself performs a confidence trick on the reader through the convoluted narrative.[43]

Branch has a slightly different interpretation of the avatars of the Confidence Man. He believes that Melville's original plan was for six characters to be the Confidence Man in disguise: Guinea, John Ringman, the man in the gray coat, John Truman (selling shares of the coal company), the herb doctor, and the man with a brass plate (the agent from the employment agency). However, this plan seems to break down when the herb doctor reappears in chapter 21 after telling the miser he has to leave soon. Branch suggested that Melville's revisions could have been incomplete. Guinea's initial list of trustworthy men included a man in a yellow vest, who could be Charlie Noble, and a man in a violet robe, who could also be Charlie Noble. It seems odd that the cosmopolitan (Frank Goodman) is not part of Guinea's list; many critics consider him another instance of the confidence man in disguise. The cosmopolitan, rather than trying to con characters into giving him money, converses with them to reveal inconsistencies in their thought. Branch interprets this as Melville's attempt ""to expose the hypocrisy or impracticability of the philosophies that support Christianity, human society, andEmersonianism.""[72]

Quirk describes how the various confidence men attest to each others' trustworthiness, like how Guinea describes a list of good and honest gentlemen, and is in turn described as trustworthy by the man with the weed and the man in gray. Quirk also interprets the ""soldier of fortune"" as a criminal malingerer, and Goodman and Noble as dueling con men.[73]

The work includes satires of 19th-century literary figures: Mark Winsome is based onRalph Waldo Emerson, while his ""practical disciple"" Egbert isHenry David Thoreau; Charlie Noble is based onNathaniel Hawthorne; and a beggar in the story was inspired byEdgar Allan Poe.[42]The conversation between Winsome and Egbert has been interpreted as satirizing the transcendentalism and its focus on self-reliance as disallowing individuals to call for help.[74]Yoshiaki Furui, an English professor atAoyama Gakuin University, saw the character of Black Guinea as an example of how Melville hints at his characters' emotions rather than explaining them. In the scene where Guinea receives alms, he swallows his ""secret emotions"" and winces when coins strike his face. However, it is unclear if he is wincing in pain, or as part of the performance of begging. The novel indicates that some inner emotion exists, ""highlighting both its presence and its unknowability at once"".[75]

English professor Caleb Doan, in an article examininggift exchangesin Melville's works, found thatThe Confidence-Manshows a ""dystopic version of exchange"" in which gifts are based not on generosity or reciprocation, but on ""self-aggrandizement and exploitation."" The steamerFidelecorresponds with America in general. The exchange between the barber William Cream and his customer Frank Goodman illustrates the deeply cynical outlookThe Confidence-Mantakes towards gift economies. Goodman convinces Cream to take down his ""No Trust"" sign by saying he will pay for anyone who betrays that trust. But then Goodman himself refuses to pay after his shave, telling him to trust him to pay later (which he does not do). Cream puts his ""No Trust"" sign back up, and we understand that, as Doan explains, ""the modern-world economy has corrupted the notion of benevolent exchange.""[76]

Characters discuss ideas that have religious significance. Jonathan Cook, a Melville scholar, described it as ""a literary theodicy dramatizing the author's obsession with the problem of evil, the existence of God, and man's limited capacity to know God or comprehend the truths that would justify the ways of God to man.""[77]

One of the main themes of the novel is unresolvable conflict, including racial conflict. In the chapter where the confidence man appears as a ""non-resistant"", the other passengers can't decide whether to have sympathy for him or to see him as trying to take advantage of their sympathy. This mirrors the tension between the belief that philosophy can help to resolve questions of morality and justice, and the belief that, as the title of the chapter states, ""many men have many minds.""[78]This initial encounter prepares the reader for the ""Indian-hating"" chapters. Writing forJ19, Rachel Ravina, an English professor at Boston University,[79]saw these chapters as commenting onGeorge Copway's writings for a white audience about his experience as anOjibweman. Copway also wrote about white culture as an insider-outsider. Melville's chapters focus on the generalizations made infrontierwriting. The character Charlie Noble tells the confidence man stories about John Moredock which he heard secondhand. Moredock is the eponymous Indian-hater of the chapter. Ravina interprets this as a commentary on how the information is filtered through multiple people: ""we are meant to notice the absence of direct Indian speech, its silencing, filtering, distortion, or inaccessibility, along with the erasure of white violence in the selective process by which colonizers rewrite the facts.""[80]Another chapter on Indian-hating is a mock philosophical treatise on the metaphysics of Indian-hating. It posits that Indian-hating may be socialized, or chemically predisposed, and that a simple difference in environment creates physical racial differences. The satire, while trying to find a rational explanations for ""Indian nature"" as well as Indian-hating, which Ravina states, ""points to the limitations of empirical investigations of race and the limitless bias of ethnographic description, which can never have the objectivity its authority performs."" The narrator of the chapter points out his own unreliability, stating that an Indian-hating backwoodsman would never use these words, but that another person ""found him expression for his meaning.""[81]Ravina generalizes the issues these chapters raise, seeing them ""as an impetus for readers to recognize the representational limits of their sources and the racial dynamics of power and speech.""[82]

The novel was turned into an opera byGeorge Rochberg; it was premiered by theSanta Fe Operain 1982, but was not held to be a success.[83]

Rian Johnson's 2008 filmThe Brothers Bloomcontains plot elements and some characters that allude toThe Confidence-Man.[84][85]Anne BillsonofThe Guardianalso observed that the structural technique of using chapter titles in the film could be read as an homage both to literary inspirations such asThe Confidence-Manand to older crime films such asThe Sting.[86]"

He is put to work under Mr Rossiter in the Postage Department, replacing a youth named Bannister, and is befriended by Mr Waller, a kindly employee of the bank, who takes him to lunch; on his return, he is joined by Psmith, also a new employee, in the same department as Mike.

They go for a stroll, and Psmith reveals that he has been placed there on a whim of his father's, having annoyed Bickersdyke while he was staying for the weekend. Mike is worried that their employer has it in for them both and that they are powerless, but Psmith announces he plans to toy with Bickersdyke outside of work, being, like their employer, a member of theSenior Conservative Club. He also insists that Mike move in with him in hisflatin Clement's Inn. That night Mike feels much happier for having an ally.

Trying to find a means of pacifying their manager Mr Rossiter, they find out from Bannister that he is a devotee of association football and a fan ofManchester United. For a few weeks Psmith uses this knowledge to ingratiate himself with Rossiter, before moving on to Bickersdyke. He haunts the man at their club, his position in the workplace unassailable thanks to his friendship with Rossiter, and disrupts a political meeting, part of Bickersdyke's campaign to become a member of parliament, turning it into a near-riot. Bickersdyke is angry at Psmith, but powerless.

Psmith continues to cultivate Mr Rossiter, and Mike gets used to his work. After a while, a new man starts, and Mike is moved on to the Cash Department, under Mr Waller. One day, hearing Psmith call Mike ""Comrade"", Waller reveals that he is an ardent socialist, and Psmith agrees to come and hear him speak, dragging Mike along. When a spectator goes to throw a stone at Waller, Mike intervenes, and a fight starts, which soon involves Psmith and a mob; the friends flee. Returning that evening for tea, Mike has an awful time, but Psmith acquires Waller's book of the proceedings of the ""Tulse Hill Parliament"", including some particularly fiery words from Mr Bickersdyke.

One day, worried by his son being ill, Waller fails to spot a forged cheque. To save the man's job, Mike takes the blame, and is fired and roasted by Bickersdyke. After work, Psmith trails Bickersdyke to aVictorian Turkish bathand threatens to leak Bickersdyke's anti-royaltyspeeches from the Tulse Hill book. Bickersdyke, furious, agrees to keep Mike on at the bank. Soon after, he is narrowly elected toParliament, rendering the threat of the book useless, and Mike is moved to a new department, Fixed Deposits, a much less pleasant spot, with Psmith replacing him under Mr Waller.

As spring and sunshine arrive, Mike begins to long for the outdoors and his belovedcricket. One day, he is called by his brother Joe, who is playing for their county atLord's. They are a man short, and need Mike to play; he agrees, asking Psmith to tell his new boss he has to ""pop off""; the boss tells Mr Bickersdyke, who, as usual, is furious. Mike, convinced his job is over, resolves to play his heart out.

Psmith leaves work early, to take his father to the match. Mr Smith is shocked that the bank does not approve of people leaving to play cricket; Psmith persuades him that rather than working at the bank, he should study for theBar. They arrive at the game just as Mike, playing well, reaches hiscentury. After the match, Psmith tells Mike of his plans to study law atCambridge, and also that his father, needing an agent for his estate, is willing to take Mike on, having first paid for him to go to the 'varsity too, to study the business.

Mr Bickersdyke, relaxing in his club, overjoyed at the thought of finally being able to sack Psmith and Mike, is further enraged when Psmith sympathetically announces their retirement from business.

Under the titleThe New Fold, the story was published in six parts from October 1908 to March 1909 inThe Captainand illustrated by T. M. R. Whitwell.[3]

The book is dedicated: ""To Leslie Havergal Bradshaw"". The first edition of the book included twelve full page illustrations by T. M. R. Whitwell. The American edition was issued in November 1910 by Macmillan, New York, from imported sheets.[1]

The story was included in the 1974 collectionThe World of Psmith, published by Barrie & Jenkins, London.[4]An excerpt from the novel was included in the anthologyBenny Green's The Cricket Addict's Archive, published in London by Elm Tree Books in 1977 and by Pavilion Books in 1985.[5]

The book contains an early use in print of a variation of the phrase ""Elementary, my dear Watson"".[6]In the book, Psmith says after making a deduction, ""My dear Holmes, how—! Elementary, my dear fellow, quite elementary."" This appeared in the second part of the serial inThe Captainmagazine, published in November 1908.[7]The phrase ""Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary"" is used by Psmith in the following novel,Psmith, Journalist.

The British writer Jeremy Lewis calledPsmith in the City""the supreme achievement of P. G. Wodehouse,"" describing it as ""a masterly exposé of office life.""[8]

The story was adapted as a radio drama, which first aired in four parts between 19 September and 10 October 2008 on BBC Radio 4, dramatised byMarcy Kahanand produced by Abigail le Fleming. The cast includedSimon Williamsas P. G. Wodehouse (the narrator),Nick Caldecottas Psmith, Inam Mirza as Mike Jackson,Stephen Critchlowas John Bickersdyke, Jonathan Tafler as Mr Waller,Robert Lonsdaleas Bannister,Dan Starkeyas Jo Jackson and Bill,Ryan Watsonas Edward Waller, Jill Cardo as Ada, andChris Pavloas Mr Rossiter, Mr Jackson, Mr Gregory, and Comrade Prebble.[9]

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28837,Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Men_in_a_Boat,"The story begins by introducing George, Harris, Jerome (always referred to as ""J.""), and Jerome's dog, Montmorency. The men are spending an evening in J.'s room, smoking and discussing illnesses from which they fancy they suffer. They conclude that they are all suffering from ""overwork"", and need a holiday. A stay in the country and a sea trip are both considered. The country stay is rejected because Harris claims that it would be dull, and the sea-trip after J. describes bad experiences his brother-in-law and a friend had on previous sea-trips. The three eventually decide on a boating holiday up theRiver Thames, from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford, during which they will camp, notwithstanding more of J.'s anecdotes about previous mishaps with tents and camping stoves.

They set off the following Saturday. George must go to work that morning, so J. and Harris make their way to Kingston by train. They cannot find the right train atWaterloo station(the station's confusing layout was a well-known theme of Victorian comedy) so they bribe a train driver to take his train to Kingston, where they collect the hired boat and start the journey. They meet George further up-river atWeybridge.

The remainder of the story describes their river journey and the incidents that occur. The book's original purpose as a guidebook is apparent as J., the narrator, describes passing landmarks and villages such asHampton Court Palace,Hampton Church,Magna Carta IslandandMonkey Island, and muses on historical associations of these places. However, he frequently digresses into humorous anecdotes that range from the unreliability ofbarometersfor weather forecasting to the difficulties encountered when learning to play theScottish bagpipes. The most frequent topics of J.'s anecdotes are river pastimes such as fishing and boating and the difficulties they present to the inexperienced and unwary and to the three men on previous boating trips.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558,Barry Lyndon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon,"Redmond Barry of Ballybarry, born to a genteel but ruined Irish family, fancies himself a gentleman. At the prompting of his mother, he learns what he can of courtly manners and swordplay but fails at more scholarly subjects like Latin. He is a passionate, hot-tempered young man who develops a deep love for Nora, his cousin, who is a few years older than Redmond. However, even though Nora enjoys flirting with Redmond, she is only interested in a man with money.

Redmond becomes angered when Nora is courted by John Quin, who is not only wealthy but also a respected officer and nobleman. A dueling challenge is issued, but Nora's family sees an opportunity to drive him off and secretly load his pistol withtow, a dummy load of heavy, knotted fibres.

Quin fakes his death, and Redmond is convinced by Nora's parents that he will be charged with murder. As expected, he flees toDublinand falls in with swindlers who take advantage of hisnaivety. Left penniless and with creditors at his heels, Redmond enlists as a common private in aBritish Armyinfantry regiment headed forservice in Germanyduring theSeven Years' War.

Once in Germany, despite a promotion to corporal, he hates the army and seeks to desert. When Lieutenant Fakenham is wounded and left for dead, Redmond seduces a rich peasant woman to get him food and shelter. Redmond pretends to suffer from insanity, and after several days absconds with the lieutenant's uniform, papers, and money. As part of his ruse, he convinces the locals that he is the real Lieutenant Fakenham, and the wounded man is the mad Corporal Barry. He then rides off for a neutral part of Germany to seek his fortune.

His bad luck continues, however, as he is quickly captured by aPrussianofficer. The German soon realises that Redmond is a deserter, but rather than turn him over to the British to be hanged, impresses him into thePrussian Army(for a bounty). Redmond hates Prussian service as much or more than he hated British service, but the men are carefully watched to prevent desertion. Redmond marches withFrederick's army into theBattle of Kunersdorfand barely survives. He saves the life of Captain Potzdorff; the captain takes him in as his aide and later gets Redmond a job working for the Prussian state ministry.

After several months have passed, a stranger travelling under Austrian protection arrives in Berlin. Redmond is asked to spy on the stranger, an older man called ""Chevalier de Balibari"" (sc. Ballybarry). He immediately realises that this is his uncle, a notoriousCatholicadventurer who disappeared many years ago. The uncle uses his connections to smuggle himself and his nephew out of Prussia, and they quickly take up lives as gamblers and spendthrifts.

Eventually, the Barrys end up in aRhinelandduchy. After winning a large sum of money, enough to present himself as a rich aristocrat, Redmond schemes to marry into the family of a young German heiress. Again, fortune turns against him, and a series of circumstances undermines his complex plan. (The story of the unhappy Princess Olivia was based on a scandalous account ofDuchess Augusta of Brunswick-WolfenbüttelbyÉtienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon.) The two Barrys are subsequently forced out of Germany in disgrace.

While staying in France following his uncle's death, Redmond comes into the acquaintance of the Countess of Lyndon, an extraordinarily wealthy noblewoman married to a much older man in poor health. He has some success in seducing the lady, but her husband clings to life. Eventually, she and her husband return to England. Redmond is upset but bides his time. Upon hearing that the husband has died the following year, he makes his move on the Countess.

Through a series of adventures, Redmond eventually bullies and seduces the Countess, who marries him somewhat under duress, but also falls in love with him. After the wedding, he remodels her home, Hackton Castle, at great expense. Count Barry Lyndon (as he now calls himself) admits several times in the course of his narrative that he is incapable of managing money, despite his history of poverty and hardship. He looks after a few childhood benefactors in Ireland, including his cousin Ulick (Nora's brother, who had often stood up for him as a boy) who he personally styles into a fashionable young socialite.

As theAmerican Revolutionary Warbreaks out, Barry seeks to raise his prestige, financing a regiment of men to serve in America and gaining control of the Lyndon familypocket boroughso he may sit inParliament. However, his good fortunes ebb again: his stepson (and his wife's heir), Lord Bullingdon, is reported dead in America; as Barry had commissioned the boy commander of his regiment, he is accused of plotting his demise. His own child, Bryan, dies in a tragic horse-riding accident at nine years of age. This, combined with Barry's profligate spending practices, leads to his ruin. With his son dead, he is now at the mercy of his wife's hostile cousins, who gain control of the Lyndon estate.

As the ""memoir"" ends, Barry is separated from his wife and placed inFleet Prisonas a debtor. A small stipend provided by his wife allows him to live in moderate luxury at first, and his elderly mother lodges close by to tend to him. Unfortunately for him, Lord Bullingdon was not dead – he had been captured and imprisoned but survived until the end of the war. When the Countess dies, her son is quick to disown his stepfather and cut off any further allowances. The story ends with Barry dying of complications from drinking cheap prison liquor.

Thackeray began writingThe Luck of Barry Lyndon: A Romance of the Last Century. By Fitz-Boodlein Paris[2]in October 1843, andFraser'sbegan publishing installments starting in January of the following year. Throughout the monthly releases, Thackeray managed to keep an advance of one or two chapters, but in October 1844, the promised manuscript was not ready on time, and the editor-in-chief Nickisson published another text in its place. The author complains about the difficulty of the task, which requires much more reading than he thought and deals with a subject that is not very sympathetic. He wrote on 14 August 1844 that it had become a nightmare and with relief, on 3 November 1844, he put the final period, noting: ""Finished Barry after much agony last night."" The final part was written during a trip to Egypt, and the ultimate chapter in Malta in October 1844 on the way back, while the ship was in quarantine in the port of Valletta.[3]

The original title of the 1844 publication contains the wordluck, which in this context does not mean ""chance"" but ""worldly success"".[4]The choice of this word indicates that this success results from the wealth and social importance that come from marrying the richest widow in the kingdom. According to a terminology peculiar to Barry, the alternation betweenluckandill-luckmarks the fluctuations of his fortune.

The first edition of 1844 is composed of two asymmetrical parts: sixteen chapters are devoted to Barry's social ascent, and three (published in September, November, and December 1844) to his decline and fall.

When republished in 1865,[N 1]along with several other stories, in a book titledMiscellanies;[5]the novel becameThe Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq., By Himself, the publisher's initiative followed by a plethora of pompous mentions emphasizing the grandiose destiny of the scoundrel.[6]

This version contains some modifications: the first two chapters were merged into one; in the second part, the beginning of chapter XVII was deleted; and a long passage from the conclusion dealing with immanent justice was deleted. Original, Thackeray wrote, that this justice is absent from this world, with villains remaining rich while honest people are just as poor; and further insisting a little later ""Justice, great God! Does human life show justice in this way? Do the good always ride in a gilded carriage and the wicked go to the hospice? Is the charlatan never preferred to the capable? Does the world always reward merit, never fall for verbiage, never rush to hear some ass bray from his pulpit?"". In addition, some of the digressions written in the third person, actually intrusions by the author, are reinserted, but in the first person, that is, placed this time in Barry's mouth. Finally, the pseudonym Fitz-Boodle is abandoned, andMiscellaniesin its entirety is signed byWilliam Makepeace Thackeray.

Although the book was harshly judged during its serialization, the tone changed considerably upon its publication in volumes. By 1856, Thackeray was recognized as one of the masters of the English novel, and his works were appreciated with greater consideration. The influentialSaturday Review, founded byAlexander Beresford Hopein 1855, considered Barry Lyndon to be the most characteristic and successful of Thackeray's works. Several of the author's colleagues emphasized the tour de force represented by this novel, particularly Trollope, who proclaimed that ""if Dickens revealed the best of his creative power early in life, Thackeray showed himself to have a superior intellect. Never has the strength of his mind been raised higher than in Barry Lyndon, and I know of no storyteller whose intellectual faculties can surpass this prodigious enterprise."" American writer William Dean Howells, who read the novel as early as 1852, wrote that it was ""the most perfect creation [...] a fabulous feat of pure irony."" Finally, Anne Thackeray Ritchie, the novelist's daughter, after recounting the anecdote in which her father advised her against reading the book, wrote: ""Certainly, it is a difficult book to love, but one admires it for its consummate power and art.""

Thackeray got the idea for this novel during a visit with the art collector John Bowes (whom he knew from school)[7]to Streatlam Castle in June and July 1841. InFraser's Magazine, he wrote:

In fact, these documents come from the Strathmore family, of which John Bowes is the illegitimate descendant, and are collected in a pamphlet byJesse Foot, entitledLives ofAndrew Robinson Stoney-Bowesand the Countess of Strathmore, published in London in 1812.[2]Bowes owns an annotated copy that Thackeray probably knew about, and the character ofAndrew Robinson Bowesimmediately fascinates him[9][10]

According to other sources, an inspiration for his character was CaptainJames Freney, the ""Irish Robin Hood"", whose adventures he read about in an inn inGalwayin 1841,[11]whom he places in his novel on Barry's path in Ireland shortly after his hero's departure for the great world, and who is briefly mentioned in chapter IV where Barry learns about his exploits from Mrs. Fitzsimmons.[12]However, while Freney, in Thackeray's words, ""declines great deeds with all modesty"", Barry brandishes ""little deeds high and loud"".[13]According to another hypothesis, the model encompasses the Irish in general, whom he sketched in hisIrish Sketch Bookof 1843, ""this brilliant, audacious, belligerent, exuberant, whiskey-drinking people"".[14]

In fact, ""Barry Lyndon"" contains several episodes already used in this ""Irish Sketch Book"", for example, Barry's arrival in Dublin where he is greeted with much fervor and adulation. In his travel journal, Thackeray notes:

Finally, as Thackeray wrote, he traveled constantly, hence, according to some critics, the cosmopolitan aspect of the novel, with significant episodes set in France or Germany, and also some details echoing the author's Middle Eastern tour, such as Barry's stay in Ludwigslust where he is accompanied by a ""negro"" named Zamor, dresses in Turkish clothing, and stays in a ""palace arranged in an Oriental and quite sumptuous manner"".[2]

From the first paragraphs of his narrative, with the help of heraldists, the Englishman Gwillim and the Frenchman Louis Pierre d'Hozier (p. 13, then 139, according to the 1975 edition used as a reference), Barry takes stock of his lineage: ""I am of the opinion that there is no gentleman in all of Europe who has not heard of the Barry family of Barryogue, in the kingdom of Ireland [...]"" Throughout the novel, he frequently returns to this subject, especially in chapter IV where his uncle, the Chevalier de Bali-Bari, asserts that this is ""the only knowledge becoming of a gentleman."" In fact, Thackeray himself shared this concern for genealogy, particularly while writing the novel; Fraser's Magazine had just featured Drummond (a list of noble families with mention of their genealogy) as a theme before The Luck of Barry Lyndon.

This question of nobility of heart as opposed to that of birth is in the air: Dickens takes it up four years after Barry Lyndon in Great Expectations (1860), another first-person novel, where he has Herbert Pocket say exactly the same thing as he undertakes to instill some life principles in young Pip and quotes his father Matthew Pocket: ""It is one of his principles that no man has ever behaved like a gentleman without first having been, since the world began, a gentleman at heart. He says, there is no veneer that can hide the grain of wood, and the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself."" In the same novel, Joe Gargery the blacksmith, who has always protected Pip from the wrath of his shrewish sister, goes to London to see his young brother-in-law. Not knowing quite what to do with his hat on arrival, he realizes that Pip is now ashamed of him; sorry for not having respected his rank, he returns disillusioned to his forge, while Pip, led astray by snobbery, says, ""He made me lose my temper and exasperated me"" (chapter XXVII, p. 631).

Another concern of Thackeray's is the events in Ireland: although the story of Barry Lyndon is supposed to take place in the 18th century, the book echoes the Anglo-Irish relations of the first half of the 19th century, especially the campaign for the abolition of theAct of Union, which, under the impetus ofDaniel O'Connell, raged in the 1840s and culminated in 1843 with the revival of the so-calledIrish Home Rule movement.

The last part of the story, concerning Redmond Barry's tumultuous relationship with Lady Lyndon, is inspired by the life ofAndrew Robinson Stoney-Bowes, a type of character that the English commonly call a ""Rake"" or ""Rakehell"", meaning a gambler, debaucher, reveller, and indebted person.[16]And according to Robert A. Colby, the plot involving thePrincess of Xis based on what Thackeray called ""a silly little book"", titledL'Empire, ou, Dix ans sous Napoléon(1836), by BaronÉtienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon(1786-1864),[17]which relates, among other things, the execution of Princess Caroline by the King of Wurttemberg for adultery[18][N 2]The two stories seem to have merged in Thackeray's mind, as both involve tyrannical husbands, hysterical wives, and adultery against a backdrop of a corrupt society.[2]

Barry's grim ending echoes that of the real-life Irish journalist and co-founder ofFraser's Magazine,William Maginn(1794-1842). ""Maginn a superb subject for a little morality"", comments Thackeray upon reading an obituary tribute published inFraser's.[19]However, unlike Barry, who is uneducated, Maginn is a scholarly and witty scholar, but shares with him an easy charm and an abyssal prodigality, and in 1842 his indebtedness landed him in Fleet Prison, from which he only emerged, consumed bytuberculosis, to die that same year.

A parallel can also be drawn between the shameful end of Barry in prison and the miserable exile of the famous ""Beau"" Brummell (1778-1840) in France, who fled from his debts and whose career has been in the spotlight since William Jesse published his biography in 1844. Thackeray himself gave a review of this publication in theMorning Chronicleof 6 May 1844, reprinted inThackeray's Contributions to the Morning Chronicle, Gordon N. Ray, Urbana, Illinois, 1995, p. 31-39, whileBarry Lyndonwas being written. Moreover, in chapter XIII, p. 193, Thackeray places an allusion in the form of a wink under the pen of his narrator hero:"

He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with ""Ratty"" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had ""read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends"".[12]

InThe Enchanted Places,Christopher Robin Milnewrote ofThe Wind in the Willows:

The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story. Dramatisations include:

Abridged readings:

Other presentation formats:

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that ""Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...""[34]

By the former scheme, the first half ofCandideconstitutes therising actionand the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure andpicaresquenovels, which tend to employ such adramatic structure.[45]By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in theAmericas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and theOttoman Empire.[46][47]The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.

The tale ofCandidebegins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh inWestphalia, home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cunégonde; hisbastardnephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; achambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. Theprotagonist, Candide, is romantically attracted to Cunégonde. He is a young man of ""the most unaffected simplicity"" (l'esprit le plus simple), whose face is ""the true index of his mind"" (sa physionomie annonçait son âme).[2]Dr. Pangloss, professor of ""métaphysico-théologo-cosmolonigologie"" (English: ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"") and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the ""best of all possible worlds"" and that ""all is for the best"".

All is well in the castle until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured byBulgar(Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he isflogged, nearlyexecuted, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (anallegoryrepresenting the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, anAnabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar withsyphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cunégonde wasrapedbefore her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail toLisbon.

In Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard.[48]The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the ""brutish sailor"" who let Jacques drown[49]survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit byan earthquake, tsunami, and firethat kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.

The next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of thePortuguese Inquisition, and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an ""auto-da-fé"" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman,[50]who leads him to a house where Lady Cunégonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cunégonde had been raped anddisemboweled. She had been, but Cunégonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corruptGrand Inquisitorinto sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cunégonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and thesabbath day). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas.[51]Along the way, Cunégonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her.

The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter ofPope Urban Xand the Princess ofPalestrina, she was kidnapped and enslaved byBarbary pirates, witnessed violent civil wars inMoroccounder the bloodthirsty kingMoulay Ismaïl(during which her mother wasdrawn and quartered), suffered constant hunger, nearly died from aplagueinAlgiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starvingJanissariesduring theRussian capture of Azov. After traversing all theRussian Empire, she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cunégonde.

The trio arrives inBuenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, analcalde(a Spanish magistrate) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees toParaguaywith his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.

At aborder poston the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to thecommandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, theJesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order.[51]When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with hisrapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.

Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of theIncanobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.[52]

After a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander intoEl Dorado, a geographically isolatedutopiawhere the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny.[53]Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.

Candide and Cacambo eventually reachSurinamewhere they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.

This companion, Martin, is aManichaeanscholarbased on the real-life pessimistPierre Bayle, who was a chief opponent of Leibniz.[54]For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour toBordeauxandParis, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based onAdmiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time ""pour encourager les autres"" (to encourage the others).[55]Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival inVenice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with aTheatinemonk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object since she was forced to become a prostitute, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousandpiastresto Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.

Candide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo—now a slave—arrives and informs Candide that Cunégonde is inConstantinople. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for theCarnival of Venice. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman SultanAhmed III, EmperorIvan VI of Russia,Charles Edward Stuart(an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne),Augustus III of Poland(deprived, at the time of writing, of his reign in theElectorate of Saxonydue to theSeven Years' War),Stanisław Leszczyński, andTheodore of Corsica.

On the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes on the banks of thePropontisas a slave for a fugitiveTransylvanianprince by the name ofRákóczi. After arriving at theBosphorus, they board agalleywhere, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices.[51]They both relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: ""I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and sincepre-established harmonyis the most beautiful thing in the world, along with theplenumandsubtle matter.""[56]

Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm (une petite métairie) which he just bought with the last of his finances.

One day, the protagonists seek out adervishknown as a great philosopher of the land. Candide asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Candide is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet aTurkwhose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them ""free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.""[57]Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this ""commendable plan"" (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him ""we must cultivate our garden"" (il faut cultiver notre jardin).[57]

As Voltaire himself described it, the purpose ofCandidewas to ""bring amusement to a small number of men of wit"".[2]The author achieves this goal by combining wit with a parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death ""as coolly as a weather report"".[58]The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again.[59]In the end,Candideis primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, ""short, light, rapid and humorous"".[10][60]

Behind the playful façade ofCandidewhich has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for theirInquisition, and the British for the execution ofJohn Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated inCandide. For example, Voltaire mocks theJesuit orderof theRoman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while inParaguay, Cacambo remarks, ""[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all …"". Here, Voltaire suggests theChristian mission in Paraguayis taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.[61][62]

The main method ofCandide's satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy.[10]The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.[59]ThusCandidederides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.[2][58]

A simple example of the satire ofCandideis seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin inPortsmouthharbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to representJohn Byng, being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely ""to encourage the others"" (French:pour encourager les autres, an expression Voltaire is credited with originating). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation ""to encourage the others"" thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted fromCandide.[10][63]

Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all ofCandideis a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode ofEl Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.[2][58]

Another element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works onCandide, calls the ""sentimental foibles of the age"" and Voltaire's attack on them.[64]Flaws in European culture are highlighted asCandideparodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking the style of apicaresque novel.[64][65]A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the driftingrogueof lowsocial class, Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor, and Cacambo the skillful valet.[2]As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters ofCandideare unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and evenmarionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical.[66]As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is abildungsroman, if not a very serious one.[2][67]

Gardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role inCandide. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion asAdam and Eveare evicted from theGarden of Edenin theBook of Genesis. Cyclically, the main characters ofCandideconclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent ""garden"" isEl Dorado, which may be a false Eden.[68]Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.[69]

These gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to theEncyclopédie, and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate ""his garden"" symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported theEncyclopédie: the main characters ofCandidelive in seclusion to ""cultivate [their] garden"", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in theepistolarycorrespondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing theEncyclopédie.[69]Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating ""his garden"" suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates inLes DélicesandFerney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.[70][71][72]

Candidesatirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these isLeibnizian optimism(sometimes calledPanglossianismafter its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity.[10]Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil—specifically the theological problem of
its existence—is the focus of the work.[73]Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder—evils of human design—are explored as extensively inCandideas are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is ""comprehensive"" in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.[74]

Fundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1999,Crome Yellow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crome_Yellow,"A house party at Crome is viewed largely through the eyes of Denis Stone. Described by his hostess as ""one of our younger poets"", he has been invited by Priscilla and Henry Wimbush to join their summer guests. Denis is secretly in love with their niece, Anne Wimbush, who appears more interested in the artist Gombauld.  The rather naïveflapper, Mary Bracegirdle, decides to embark on an amorous adventure so as to overcome her repressions and makes unsuccessful advances to Denis and Gombauld before falling for the libertine Ivor Lombard one summer night.[a]The hard-of-hearing Jenny Mullion confines most of her thoughts on what goes on to her journal, in which Denis eventually discovers a devastating deconstruction of himself and fellow guests.  Mr. Wimbush, the owner of Crome, has been writing a history of the house and its family, from which he gives two evening readings. His wife is obsessed withalternative spiritualityand finds a fellow sympathiser in the prolific literary hack, Mr. Barbecue-Smith. Also part of the party is Henry's former schoolfriend, the cynical Mr. Scogan, who lies in wait for anyone he can waylay with his reductive criticisms of the time and his visions for adystopianfuture. After several ludicrous failures in trying to capture Anne's affection, Denis despairingly arranges to be recalled home on 'urgent family business' at the very moment when he might have succeeded and departs on the same slow train that had brought him.

Huxley's satire on the fads and fashions of the time is generally based on real places and people. The description of the country house at which the characters gather is recognisably based onGarsington Manor, whileOttoline Morrellhas been taken for the model of Priscilla Wimbush.[7]Scogan has been identified withBertrand Russell,[8]Gombauld withMark Gertler, Mr. Calamy withH. H. Asquith,[9]and Mary Bracegirdle withDora Carrington.[10]Even small comic details sometimes have a foundation in fact, as for example Mrs Bunch's massive consumption of peaches as part of the war effort.Osbert Sitwellclaimed that this was based on an anecdote he had told Huxley about his own father.[11]

Some incidents in the novel allow others to grow out of them. The story of Sir Hercules Lapith, Henry Wimbush's predecessor at Crome, has imbedded within it some 64 lines in Augustanheroic couplets, far longer than all the parodies of modern verse in the book. Its function is to give an insight into its author’s motives for creating his alternative society for dwarfs at his home. At the same time it is a parody within a parody, since it appears as part Sir Henry's modern-day history of the house, itself a narrative within the main narrative.

Scogan's withering sketch of the contemporary novel whose subject is a sensitive young man’s development so appalls Denis Stone that he destroys the first two chapters of the novel he has brought with him to continue at Crome. On the one hand this may have been directed atJames Joyce'sPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which had been published in the previous decade. But it has also been conjectured thatCrome Yellowitself is a parody of the sort of novel Denis is dissuaded from continuing.[12]Here too the comparatively recent past model encapsulates the present text.

Conversely, a future text is prefigured in Scogan's prophecy of the ""impersonal generation"" that will ""take the place of Nature's hideous system"" by raising its children in incubators. ""The family system will disappear; society, sapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations; and Eros, beautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world."" It is an idea that Huxley would revisit at greater length inBrave New World(1932), but by that time he had passed from satirising the self-absorption and consequent lack of a vision of a positive way forward following the destructive barbarism of theFirst World War[13]to examining aspects of the failure of humanity manifested in that war and its inevitable result in the 'Rational State' that Scogan proposes.[14]

The story of Sir Hercules Lapith, who briefly turned Crome into a haven for dwarfs, was later adapted as a 60-minute radio play byPeter Mackie. This was first broadcast onBBC Radio 4in 1986 and has been repeated since.[15]

In 2014, the novelistJulian DavieswroteCrow Mellow, which he described as closely based on Aldous Huxley's novel. Set in contemporary Australia, it updates the satire to cover the hyper-capitalist 21st century in which the sex is more overt and art too has become a commodity.[16]

Virginity, an American musical taking its start fromCrome Yellow, has lyrics written by Germaine Shames, music and additional lyrics by Daniel M. Lincoln. In this the deaf Jenny is given the leading role.[17][18]"
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1026,The Diary of a Nobody,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Nobody,"The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed thatCharles Pooterand his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at ""The Laurels"", Brickfield Terrace,Holloway. Mr Pooter works as a clerk in theCityfirm of Perkupp's. The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk inOldham. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses fromSutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.

The rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from theLord Mayor of Londonto attend a ball at theMansion Housefor ""Representatives of Trade and Commerce"". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.

In the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, ""Lupin"". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp's. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week inBroadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin's ""fast"" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the ""Holloway Comedians"". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.

Lupin's fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, ""the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met"".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: ""She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking"". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.

In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to ""The Laurels"". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.

In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.

April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.

Lupin is sacked from Perkupp's for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as ""Lillie Girl"", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and ""Lillie Girl"".

Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupp's a new client to replace Mr Crowbillon. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of ""The Laurels"" and presents thedeedsto Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to ""Lillie Girl"": ""We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings"".

TheDiarymade its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazinePunch.[8]The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: ""As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection"".[9]The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear inPunch.[10]ThePunchserialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupp's.[11]That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.[8]

In June 1892J.W. Arrowsmith Ltdpublished theDiaryin book form,[8]although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910.   After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982.[12]The writerRobert McCrum, in a personal list of ""The 100 greatest novels of all time"" published inThe Observernewspaper, listed theDiaryat number 35.[13]

ThePunchserialisation attracted little critical comment;The Athenaeum's literary critic thought the series ""may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes"".[15]When theDiarywas published as a book,Punchheralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as ""very funny"", adding: ""not without a touch of pathos"".[16]However, apart from a warmly approving report inThe Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. TheReview's critic thought the book ""admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius"", with a natural and irresistible appeal: ""TheDiaryhas amused us from cover to cover"".[17]This contrasted with the negative judgement ofThe Athenaeum, which opined that ""the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing"". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: ""Besides, it is all so dull"".[15]The Speaker's critic thought the book ""a study in vulgarity"",[18]whileThe New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: ""There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different"".[19]Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.[20]

By 1910 theDiarywas beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay ""On People in Books"", published earlier that year, the writer and humouristHilaire Bellochailed theDiaryas ""one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all"".[21]Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work wereLord Rosebery, the former prime minister, who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had ""purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it"".[22]Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute wasAugustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post ofChief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongsideDon Quixoteas a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—""an illiterate charwoman, it is true""—carried his name.[23]Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings.[n 1]In its review of this editionThe Bookman'scritic wrote of Charles Pooter: ""You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human"".[24]

In its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919,The Bookmanobserved that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. ""It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away"". The reviewer recommended the book's ""quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony"".[25]In Canada,Queen's Quarterlymagazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that ofThe New York Timesnearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that ""It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent"".[26]The literary criticD. B. Wyndham Lewissummarised the Pooters as ""warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads"".[27]

The novelistEvelyn Waughhad been familiar with theDiarysince his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waughused to read passages aloud to his family,[28]and Evelyn's biographerSelina Hastingshas drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household.[29]Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay ""One Way to Immortality"" that it was ""the funniest book in the world"". He added: ""Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years"".[30]Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world.[8]In his 1945 novelBrideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from theDiary""with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression"".[31]Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.[8]

At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for theDiaryanother writer,J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar ofEnglish humour;Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: ""[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart"".[32]In a 1943 essay,George Orwellconsidered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who ""constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly"".[33]In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high;Osbert Lancasterdeemed it ""a great work of art"",[34]and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians.Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought theDiary""the best comic novel in the language"", and lauded Pooter as ""the presiding shade"" of his era.[35]This accolade was echoed a further generation on byA. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: ""Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?""[36]Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as ""arbiters of the greatest good taste"", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted ""period"" homes.[37]ASpectatorarticle of 2008 remarks on how such houses as ""The Laurels"", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms ""banker land"".[38]

Peter Bailey, in his study ""White Collars, Gray Lives"" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the ""disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers"" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century.[39]The Grossmiths'Diarywas a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls theDiary""a sharp analysis of social insecurity"".[4]Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: ""putting the boot in on the lower middle classes"", says Bailey, ""has long been the intellectual's blood sport"".[40]However, the quarter-century following the publication ofThe Diary of a Nobodysaw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such asGeorge Gissing,H. G. Wells,Arnold BennettandE. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as ""Denry Machin"", ""Mr Polly"" or ""Mr Lewisham"", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, ""disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.""[40][41]

During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, ""been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds"".[8]An early example isAnita Loos's novel of 1925:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Ladyin which the protagonist,Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that ""follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech"" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, ""burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class"".[42]The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81Christopher Matthewproduced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of ""Simon Crisp"", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era.[43]The title of the first,The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume inThe Spectator,Benny Greenpoints out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is ""affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not"".[44]In 1982 came the first appearance ofSue Townsend's teenage creation,Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.[45]

Keith Waterhouse'sMrs Pooter's Diaryof 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter.[46]In 1996Helen Fieldingused the imaginary diary format forBridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life.The New York Timescritic wrote that it ""captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.""[47]This diary began as a weekly column inThe Independent. In the 1990s the satirical magazinePrivate EyelampoonedJohn Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in ""The Secret Diary of John Major aged 473⁄4"", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries withThe Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.[48][n 2]"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32596,The Revolt of the Angels,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_the_Angels,"Revoltretells the classic Christian story of thewar in Heavenbetweenangelsled by thearchangel Michaeland others led bySatan. The war ends with the defeat and casting to Earth of the latter.[2]The plot emphasises themes of protagonists fighting a ruling hierarchy, and attempting to escape it, as well as ""hiddenness, delusion, revolution, and epiphany ... a literary exploration of existential choices in an apocalyptic context"".[3]It is written, saysRené Boylesve, with a ""deft levity"".[4]Mutual antagonism between God and his angels is emphasised, which leads to disgruntlement and ultimately rebellion by the latter.[5]

The book tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Bored because Maurice d'Esparvieu continues sinning (has multiple love affairs), Arcade begins reading the books from the famous d'Esparvieu library on theology and realizes that God is not the creator of the Universe but a demiurge who rules with fear and ignorance. He informs Maurice that he will no longer be his guardian angel, moves to Paris and starts to look for other fallen angels who will join him in his quest to overthrow the false God. He and his comrades are able to build a huge army. Then they go to find Lucifer so that he may lead them. Lucifer welcomes them and tells them to stay the night and that he will give them an answer the next morning. At night he has a dream and in the morning he tells the angels that ""God, conquered, will become Satan; Satan, conquering, will become God. May the fates spare me this terrible lot.""

He says that replacing God with another is meaningless unless ""in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroyIaldabaoth"". Ialdabaoth is characterized inGnosticismas a malevolent lesser God who believes he himself alone is God, ignorant of the heavens above him. According to France, his name Ialdabaoth means ""child who wanders"".

France's political leanings—he was asocialist—heavily influencedRevolt, leading to the theme that successful revolutions always create greater tyrannies than those they overthrow.[6]The bitterness created by the revolt is reflected in the ""biting and harsh"" descriptions.[7]Joe Loewenberg has described the novel as an ""imaginative narrative ... the ripest expression of Anatole France's urbane genius, a masterpiece of criticism at once ironic and eirenic"".[8]

Essayist David Fuchs argues that much ofErnest Hemingway's early work suggests that he was probably aware of the book, even if he had not read it.[9]F. Scott FitzgeraldreferencesThe Revolt of the Angelsin his early short story ""Dancing with a Ghost"".[10]Fitzgerald also uses the book as apropin his story ""The Offshore Pirate"": the character Ardita is readingRevolt, herself looking, says Griffin, ""conically angelic ... reading a book about angels"". Fitzgerald draws attention toRevoltfive times in the story and argues that France's work is the more romantic of the two.[11]Revolthas been compared with the work ofGeorge Santayanain its suggestion that religion is set back by its successes.[12]Henry MillermentionsThe Revolt of the Angelsin his novelTropic of Capricorn."

Joe Keeble tries to persuade his imperious wife to let him give money to his beloved stepdaughter Phyllis, but is bullied out of it, and when Emsworth's feckless younger sonFreddiesuggests stealing Connie's necklace to free up some cash, Keeble is taken with the idea. Freddie, not keen on doing the job himself, sees Psmith's advert in the paper, and tags along to London with Lord Emsworth.

Meanwhile, in the metropolis, we learn thatMike, having married Phyllis on the assumption that his job as estate manager for Psmith's father would be secure, found on Mr Smith's death that the old man was bankrupt, and is working as a poorly paid schoolmaster. Psmith worked for a time for an uncle in the fish business, but could stand the fish no longer and quit.

Phyllis meets some old school friends, including Eve Halliday, an assertive young girl who pities the once-rich Phyllis, believing her too soft to cope with penury. Eve, we learn, is a friend of Freddie Threepwood, and on his encouragement has taken a post cataloguing the Blandings library, while another friend, Cynthia, has been abandoned by her husband, famous poet Ralston McTodd.

Later, Psmith sees Eve sheltering from the rain opposite theDrones, and chivalrously runs out to give her the best umbrella from the club's umbrella rack. They later meet once more at an employment agency, where Psmith has come seeking work and Eve is visiting an old friend. Psmith meets up with Freddie Threepwood, who describes his scheme to steal Connie's necklace, but dashes off without revealing his name.

Soon after, Psmith runs into Lord Emsworth at theSenior Conservative Club, where the Earl is dining with Ralston McTodd. The poet is annoyed by Emsworth's absent-mindedness, especially when the old man potters across the street to inspect a flower shop, and leaves in a rage. When Emsworth returns, Emsworth mistakes Psmith for his guest, and when Psmith sees Eve Halliday meeting Lord Emsworth, he decides to visit Blandings, posing as McTodd.

Welcomed at the castle, especially by fellow poet Peavey, Psmith is nevertheless suspected by the ever-vigilant Baxter, the real McTodd havingtelegrammedto cancel his visit. Eve arrives and Psmith begins his wooing with some success, despite her belief that he is McTodd and has jilted her friend. Freddie, worried that one of the maids is a detective, is advised by Psmith to kiss her, and judge by her response whether she is a real maid; Psmith and Eve run into him just as he is embracing the girl.

One day, a stranger arrives at the house claiming to be McTodd, but Psmith turns him politely away. The man, Edward Cootes, runs into Aileen Peavey on his way back to the station, and we learn they are both crooks, estranged lovers both after the diamonds. Cootes returns to the castle, and forces Psmith to help him get in, which Psmith does, passing Cootes off as hisvalet. Psmith arranges the use of a small cottage, in case he needs to hide the jewels from Cootes.

Cootes and Peavey make a plan to steal the necklace during a poetry-reading, while Eve, having heard from Freddie that Joe Keeble plans to give him money, questions Keeble about why he isn't helping out her friend; he enlists her as a helper in the diamond-stealing plot. As Psmith begins his reading of McTodd's poems, Cootes turns off the lights and Peavey grabs the necklace, flinging it out of the window to where Eve (by coincidence) is standing; Eve hides it in a flowerpot. Returning later to fetch it, Eve wakes the vigilant Baxter, but evades him, leaving him locked out and stashing her flowerpot on a windowsill.

Baxter, locked out of the house in his lemon-colouredpyjamas, throws flowerpots through a window to awake Lord Emsworth, who assumes he is mad and calls in Psmith to help appease him. Next morning, Baxter is fired from his job, and Eve finds the flowerpot empty at Psmith's cottage. Enlisting Freddie's help, she searches the cottage, but finds nothing; Psmith enters and explains his motives, and his friendship with Mike and Phyllis. Cootes and Peavey appear, armed, and threaten to escape with the necklace, but Psmith takes advantage of Freddie's leg falling through the ceiling to overpower Cootes and retrieve the jewels.

Keeble gives Mike the funds he requires to buy his farm, and gives Freddie enough to get him into abookmakingbusiness. Psmith and Eve get engaged, and Psmith persuades Lord Emsworth to take him on as Baxter's replacement.

Wodehouse uses vivid, exaggerated imagery in similes and metaphors for comic effect. For example, in chapter 7.11: ""A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation"".[3]

Wodehouse often uses literary references, sometimes giving the quoted passage directly with little change to the original quote, but adding to the quote to make it absurdly apposite to the situation. This occurs in chapter 11.5, after Baxter sees Psmith on the terrace of Blandings Castle:

Descriptions provided in Wodehouse's stories generally contain humorous elements, inserted into what would otherwise be pure exposition. For example, there are comic elements in the description of Aileen Peavy provided in chapter 10. To quote part of the passage: ""She [Aileen Peavey] was alone. It is a sad but indisputable fact that in this imperfect world Genius is too often condemned to walk alone—if the earthier members of the community see it coming and have time to duck"".[5]

Injuries in Wodehouse's stories generally do much less harm than would normally be expected in real life, being similar to the inconsequential injuries depicted in stage comedies. For instance, after Psmith wakes up Freddie Threepwood by arranging for Freddie's suitcase to fall on him, Freddie merely massages the stricken spot, gurgles wordlessly, and is soon ready to resume normal conversation.[6]

One of the prime sources of humour in Wodehouse's comic novels is the distinctive or absurd names given to characters, places, and brands of goods. One notable example is Psmith, who chooses to spell his name with a silent p ""as in pshrimp"" (chapter 5).[7]

One reason the novel was written was because Wodehouse's adopted daughter Leonora wanted him to write another Psmith story.[8]The book has the dedication: ""To my daughter Leonora, queen of her species.""[9]

The story was illustrated byMay Wilson PrestoninThe Saturday Evening Post.[10]The illustrator for theGrandserial is not stated, but the artist's signature, visible on some of the illustrations such as the first two in the first part[11]and one in the fifth part,[12]is the same as one used byA. Wallis Mills.[13]Mills's signature can also be seen on the illustrations for one of the other Wodehouse books serialised inThe Grand Magazine,The Adventures of Sally.[14]

The complete novel was included in the 1932 collectionNothing But Wodehouse.[15]It was also featured in the 1974 collectionThe World of Psmith.[16]

The story was adapted into a play, also titledLeave It to Psmith, by Wodehouse andIan Hay. It opened at theShaftesbury Theatrein London on 29 September 1930 and ran for 156 performances.[17]

The filmLeave It to Me(1933) was adapted from the 1930 play based on the novel.

Aradio dramabased on the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in October 1981. Dramatised byMichael Bakewell, it featuresJohn Gielgudnarrating as P. G. Wodehouse,Michael Hordernas Lord Emsworth,Joan Greenwoodas Lady Constance,Simon Wardas Psmith, andCaroline Langrisheas Eve.[18]

A 1988 Indian television ten-episode serial titledIsi Bahane(On This Excuse) was based on the novel and aired onDD National. The serial was produced byDoordarshan.[19]

The novel was dramatised for radio by Archie Scottney, withMartin Jarvisas Lord Emsworth,Patricia Hodgeas Constance,Edward Bennettas Psmith, andSusannah Fieldingas Eve. The adaptation aired on BBC Radio 4 in May 2020.[20]"

The action is given as occurring 1827–28, though critics have noted some seeming anachronisms.[7]For example, Dickens satirized thecaseofGeorge NortonsuingLord Melbournein 1836.[8]

The novel's protagonistSamuel Pickwick, Esquire is a kind and wealthy old gentleman, the founder and perpetual president of the Pickwick Club. He suggests that he and three other ""Pickwickians"" should make journeys to places remote from London and report on their findings to the other members of the club. Their travels throughout the English countryside by coach provide the chief subject matter of the novel.[9]A romantic misunderstanding with hislandlady, the widowMrs Bardell, results in one of the most famous legal cases in English literature,Bardell v. Pickwick,[10][11]leading to them both being incarcerated in theFleet Prisonfor debt.[12]

Pickwick learns that the only way he can relieve the suffering of Mrs Bardell is by paying her costs in the action against himself, thus at the same time releasing himself from the prison.[7][13]

Pickwick, Sam Weller, and his father Tony briefly reappeared in 1840 in the magazineMaster Humphrey's Clock. Master Humphrey's Clock is the name of a literary club founded by Mr Humphrey, whose members read out stories to the others.[14]Pickwick is a member, and there is a mirror club in the kitchen, Mr. Weller's Watch, run by Sam Weller.

See Mr. Pickwick inMaster Humphrey's Clock[14]

The novel has been adapted to film, television, and radio:

In 1985 BBC released a12-part 350-minute miniseriesstarringNigel Stock,Alan Parnaby,Clive SwiftandPatrick Malahide.[17]

In 1977,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Barry Campbell andConstance CoxwithFreddie Jonesas Mr. Pickwick.[18]In 1997,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Martyn Read withClive Francisas Mr. Pickwick.[19]

There was an early attempt at a theatrical adaptation with songs byW. T. Moncrieffand entitledSamuel Weller, or, The Pickwickians, in 1837. This was followed in 1871 byJohn Hollingshead's stage playBardell versus Pickwick. The first successful musical wasPickwick(sometimesPickwick, A Dramatic Cantata) bySir Francis BurnandandEdward Solomonand premiered at the Comedy Theatre on 7 February 1889.[20]

PickwickbyCyril Ornadel,Wolf Mankowitz, andLeslie Bricussewas a musical version which premiered inManchesterin 1963 before transferring to theWest End. It originally starredHarry Secombe(later cast as ""Mr. Bumble"" in the film version ofOliver!) in the title role andRoy Castleas ""Sam Weller"". Although it was a major success in London, running for 694 performances,Pickwickfailed in the United States when it opened onBroadwayin 1965. In 1969, theBBCfilmed the musical as the TV moviePickwickwith Secombe and Castle reprising their stage roles. Both the stage and TV versions featured the songIf I Ruled the World, which became a hit for Secombe and other singers such asTony BennettandSammy Davis Jr.

Part ofThe Pickwick Paperswere featured inCharles Dickens' Ghost Stories, a 60-minute animation made by Emerald City Films (1987). These includedThe Ghost in the Wardrobe,The Mail Coach Ghosts, andThe Goblin and the Gravedigger.

Stephen Jarvis's novelDeath and Mr Pickwick[21](2014) is in part a literary thriller, examining in forensic detail the question of whether the idea, character and physiognomy of Samuel Pickwick originated with Dickens, or with the original illustrator and instigator of the project, Robert Seymour. The conclusion of the narrator is that the accepted version of events given by Dickens and the publisherEdward Chapmanis untrue.

The novel was published in 19 issues over 20 months; the last was double-length and cost twoshillings. In mourning for his sister-in-lawMary Hogarth, Dickens missed a deadline and consequently, there was no number issued in May 1837. Numbers were typically issued on the last day of its given month:

Dickens drew on places that he knew from his childhood. He located the duel between Mr. Winkle and Dr. Slammer atFort Pitt, Chatham,[22]close to Ordnance Terrace where he had lived as a boy between 1817 and 1821.[23]

The popularity ofThe Pickwick Papersspawned many imitations and sequels in print, as well as actual clubs and societies inspired by the club in the novel. One example still in operation is the Pickwick Bicycle Club of London, established in 1870, the year of Charles Dickens's death.[24]The Dickens Pickwick Club was founded in 1976 byCedric Dickens, the author's great-grandson. Other clubs, groups, and societies operating under the name ""The Pickwick Club"" have existed since the original publication of the story.

In 1837, Dickens wrote to William Howison about the Edinburgh Pickwick Club. Dickens approved of the use of the name and the celebration of the characters and spirit of the novel. He wrote:

Other clubs include one meeting as early as December 1836 in the East of London and another meeting at the Sun Tavern inLong Acrein London. Dickens wrote to the secretary of the latter club in 1838 about attending a meeting:

In many Pickwick Clubs, members can take on the names of the characters in the novel. The website for the Pickwick Bicycle Club states: ""Our rules state that 'Each Member shall adopt the sobriquet allocated by the Management Committee, being the name of some male character in the Pickwick Papers, and be addressed as such at all meetings of the Club'.""[27]

A French translation byEugénie Niboyetappeared in 1838 in a two-volume edition. It was entitledLe Club des Pickwistes, roman comique. Later French translations have used titles such asAventures de Monsieur Pickwick.

Benito Pérez GaldóspublishedAventuras de Pickwick, a Spanish translation of thePickwick Papers, in 1868. Although Pérez Galdós was not born until after the publication of Dickens' first novel, he is sometimes described as the Spanish equivalent of Dickens.[28]

He then goes back to his childhood.

He was a wealthy, spoiled, and wicked child. From an early age, he showed signs of a perverse nature, beating the heads of his slaves when he was not attended to in some desire or playing horse riding on the back of a young male slave named Prudêncio. At the age of seventeen, Brás Cubas falls in love with a prostitute named Marcela, an affair which lasts ""fifteen months and elevencontos"" and almost wipes out the family fortune.

To forget this heartbreak, the protagonist is sent toCoimbrato study law. After a few years of wild bohemianism, ""following romanticism in practice and liberalism in theory,"" he returns to Rio de Janeiro on the occasion of the death of his mother. He falls in love with a girl named Eugênia, the daughter of Dona Eusébia, a poor friend of the family, who turns out to be lame from birth. His father plans to have a political marriage with Virgília, daughter of Conselheiro Dutra. However, Virgília prefers to marry Lobo Neves, who is also a candidate for a political career. With the death of Brás Cubas' father, conflict breaks out over the inheritance between him and his sister Sabina, and her husband Cotrim.

Virgília, now married, encounters Brás Cubas at a ball and they begin an adulterous affair. Virgília becomes pregnant but the child dies before being born. To keep the affair secret Brás Cubas bribes Virgília's former seamstress Dona Plácida to act as the resident of a small house inGamboa, which serves as a meeting place for the lovers. Cubas meets Quincas Borba, a childhood friend who has fallen on hard times. He steals Cubas' watch, later returning it to him. He introduced Cubas to his philosophical system, Humanitism.

Pursuing fame or excitement, Brás Cubas becomes a deputy. Lobo Neves is appointed governor of a province and leaves with Virgília for the north, ending the affair. Sabina finds a wife for Brás Cubas, Nhã-Loló, Cotrim's 19-year-old niece, but she dies of yellow fever and Brás Cubas becomes a confirmed bachelor. He tried unsuccessfully to become Minister of State and to found an opposition newspaper. Quincas Borba shows signs of dementia. An aging Virgília asks him to support the impoverished Dona Plácida, who then dies. Lobo Neves, Marcela and Quincas Borba also die. Eugênia falls into poverty. His last attempt at glory is the ""Brás Cubas poultice"", a medicine that will cure all diseases. Ironically, while going out to take care of his project, he is caught in a rainstorm and catches pneumonia, from which he dies at age sixty-four. Virgília, accompanied by her son, visits his deathbed. After dying he begins to tell the story of his life backwards, concluding that on balance his life has been slightly positive because he has not had children, and thus he has not ""transmitted the legacy of misery"".

Cubas considers his life in the manner of an accounting, finding neither any positives or negatives; but he then realises that since he has not fathered any children he has not passed on the ""misery"" of life any further. For this reason he considers his life a success. Assis published his work in 1881 and it is influenced by the philosophy ofArthur Schopenhauer, aGermanphilosopher whose philosophicalmagnum opus,The World as Will and Representationwas first published in 1818. Schopenhauer's influence on the novel's philosophy is without doubt when one compares Cubas' description of insects and his attitude towards animals, which is a feature of Schopenhauer's philosophical outlook; and in Schopenhauer's writing he similarly uses examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate a philosophical truth (most famously that of the Australianbull-ant). Assis' allusion to Schopenhauer's philosophy is also 'formal': the chapter structure ofThe Posthumous Memoirsmimics that of Schopenhauer'sWorld as Will and Representation; Bras Cubas' ""method"" in the novel, specifically the practice of referring to incidents in previous chapters by the chapter number, is imitative. Schopenhauer is often referred to as the 'King' of pessimists, or the 'Philosopher of despair'; his outlook is heavily linked to that ofBuddhism.

It is important to note that Assis created a philosophical theory to criticizePositivism, which was common in Brazil's literature back then. The theory in question was Humanitism, created in the books by Quincas Borba, a friend of Brás Cubas who had gone mad before dying. By doing this, Assis sharply criticizes the current philosophical theories, implying that only someone crazy would believe in them. Humanitism is to believe in Humanitas, which, according to Borba, is ""the principle of the things, the same man equally distributed in all men"". Therefore, if all men are equally Humanitas, an executioner killing a convict of murder is just ""Humanitas correcting Humanitas because of an infraction of the laws of Humanitas"". Envy is just ""an admiration that fights for Humanitas against Humanitas"", and thus, ""war being the grand function of humankind, all the pugnacious feelings are the most adequate to happiness. From this, I came to the conclusion: envy is a virtue"". If envy is a virtue, then cynicism, vanity and egoism are legitimated. Assis, through an ingenious fallacy, implied that envy is positive, in the same way many theories could ""prove"" true something clearly absurd looking through today's eyes.

In an article in The Guardian,Woody Allenlisted the work as one of his favorites. He said in an interview with the newspaper:

In the New York Times,Parul Sehgalpraised the book new release with a new translation, also praising its irony and charm, while asking the readers ""Is it possible that the most modern, most startlingly avant-garde novel to appear this year was originally published in 1881?"".[3]In the same 2020 release,Dave Eggersfrom The New Yorker defined the book as ""one of the wittiest, most playful, and therefore most alive and ageless books ever written"".[4]

There have been multiple translations. It was first translated into English in 1952 asEpitaph of a Small Winnerby William L. Grossman.[5]In 1997, it was translated asThe Posthumous Memoirs of Brás CubasbyGregory Rabassa.[6]In 2020, there were two new translations, by Flora Thomson-DeVeaux (Penguin Classics) andMargaret Jull Costaand Robin Patterson (Liveright). TheNew York Timesnamed Jull Costa and Patterson's translation ""the superior translation"" (Parul Sehgal,The New York Times).[7]"
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30165,Die Abenteuer Tom Sawyers (German),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer,"Orphan Tom Sawyer (around 12 to 13 years old) lives with hisAunt Pollyand his half-brother Sid in the town ofSt. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime in the 1840s. He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes himwhitewashher fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him smalltrinketsand treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his work, usingreverse psychologyto convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in hisSunday schoolclass for tickets given out for memorizing verses ofScripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prizedBiblefrom the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.

Tom falls in love withBecky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get ""engaged"" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was ""engaged"" to another schoolgirl,Amy Lawrence.

Becky spurns Tom, who accompaniesHuckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform aritualintended to healwarts. At the graveyard, they witness threebody snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter andInjun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potterunconsciousand is thenmurderedby Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear ablood oathnot to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe's claim.

Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson's Island in theMississippi Riverto begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing andpresumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his ownfuneral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing atchurchin the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master'sanatomybook after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting thepunishmentthat would have been hers.

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/804,A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sentimental_Journey_Through_France_and_Italy,"Yorick's journey starts inCalais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes as a gesture of friendship. He sees a woman, Madame L—, and is intrigued by her; he will continue to encounter her throughout the novel. Yorick buys achaiseto continue his journey. Yorick then inserts aprefacecataloguing different kinds of travellers.

After some time in Calais, the next town he visits isMontreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur. Along the way, they pass a man mourning for his deadass; Yorick sympathizes with him, but his sympathy is interrupted by his carriage driving away too quickly. They travel throughNampontandAmiensbefore arriving in Paris.

In Paris, he is distracted by the beauty of a shop girl (grisette) when he asks her for directions to theOpera Comique. After the opera, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France, he risks imprisonment in theBastille. He sees astarlingin a cage, which seems to be repeating the phrase ""I can't get out""; he is unable to free it and, dwelling on its captivity, becomes miserable imagining the suffering of a prisoner in the Bastille.

Yorick travels toVersaillesto acquire a passport, and visits the Count de B****. When Yorick notices the count readsHamlet, he points with his finger atYorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king'sjesterand quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.

Yorick returns to Paris and stays a few more days before continuing his voyage to Italy. He visits Maria—who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel,Tristram Shandy—inMoulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.

After having passedLyonduring his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. The novel ends abruptly in the middle of a scene, with adouble entendre.

A Sentimental Journeywas partly written in response to the declining public opinion of Sterne's previous novel,Tristram Shandy, which he had been publishing in instalments since 1762.Tristram Shandywas primarily a comic novel, with some passages of moral sentiments. It was most praised for its sentimentality, with some reviewers suggesting that Sterne was better at writingpathosthan humour.[1]As the 1760s went on, the general literary taste also grew more disapproving of lewd content, contributing to the declining appreciation for (and sales of)Tristram Shandy's ongoing instalments.[2]In 1765,Ralph Griffithsreviewed the latest volumes ofTristram Shandyby saying that the public was no longer interested in that novel, directly advising Sterne to begin a new one focused on sentimentality. Griffiths later took credit for the publication ofA Sentimental Journey, which he praised.[3]

Concurrently with writingTristram Shandy, Sterne travelled to Paris in January 1762, before theSeven Years' Warended.[4]He visited France until 1764, followed by a trip through France and Italy from 1765 to 1766.[5]These travels inspired a parodic account of theGrand Tourin volume 7 ofTristram Shandyin 1765.[6]Still inspired, he decided to write a new book which would experiment with the genre of thetravel narrative, and revive his literary reputation after the declining sales ofTristram Shandy.[6]

Sterne first mentioned his plans for a new project in the summer of 1766, when he wrote that he would start a new travel-oriented four-volume work after he had finished the ninth volume ofTristram Shandy.[7]That ninth volume was published in January 1767,[8]and he wrote again about his ideas for a travel narrative in a letter to his daughter in February of 1767.[6]Sterne was very ill that spring, but better in the summer.[7]By June 1767, he was working seriously on the novel, with particular efforts in November and December.[6]His illness grew severe again in December.[7]During the process of composition, Sterne frequently exchanged passionate letters with a married woman,Elizabeth Draper. These letters commented on and influenced his novel-writing, and both express intense, frustrated desire.[9]He signed all his letters to her as ""Yorick"".[6]The letters were later published asLetters from Yorick to Elizain 1773, and more of his correspondence asJournal to Elizain 1904.[6]

In January 1768, the writing was complete for the first two volumes, and Sterne travelled to London to monitor the printing process.[10]The first two volumes ofA Sentimental Journeywere published on February 27, 1768.[6]The publication of the book was partly funded throughsubscriptionsand begins with a list of the subscribers' names.[11]Notable subscribers include theArchbishop of Yorkand theMarquis of Rockingham, as well as the famous actorDavid Garrick.[12]Elizabeth Draper subscribed under the pseudonym ""Sterne's Eliza"", purchasing three copies.[12]Subscribers had the option of receiving their copy printed on higher-quality paper.[12]The book ends with atipped-in pagepromising subscribers that they will receive the final two volumes the next winter.[11]However, only the first two were published due to Sterne's death in March.[9]

The book went through dozens of editions in the late eighteenth century, indicating substantial sales.[13]The second edition appeared on March 29, 1768—barely a month after the first edition and eleven days after Sterne's death.[14]A Sentimental Journeywas rapidly and widely translated on its publication. German and French editions appeared the same year as the English, and by the early 1800s it had been translated into seven other European languages.[9]It was soon published with a variety of annotated critical editions, starting with a 1782 edition which provided a French glossary.[13]It also appeared in pocket-sized editions to be carried on readers' travels.[13]At least fourteen illustrated editions were published between 1768 and 1810, with different illustrators.[15]Later editions include illustrations byThomas Heath Robinson(1869–1954),Vera Willoughby(1870–1939),Gwen Raverat(1885–1957), andBrian Robb(1913–1979).[16]

The language ofA Sentimental Journeyis playful, with an interest in puns, especially sexualdouble entendres.[9]The final line of the novel — which suggests grabbing a woman's ""end"" through the well-timed paratextual note indicating the end of the volume — illustrates the linguistic and metatextual playfulness of the book, and its allusive approach to sexuality.[10]Throughaposiopesis, Sterne often abandons a sentence or a narrative at a key moment, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks as to what should follow.[17]The novel is particularly likely to leave an obvious blank, with a word or phrase censored through asterisks or dashes, when the topic is sex or death.[18]

Structurally, the novel ispicaresquein its meandering series of disconnected adventures on the road.[6]It is alsoquixoticin its hero's over-attachment to a misguided ideal.[6]The novel moves betweentableaux-like scenes with little information about the links between them, often omitting explanations of how Yorick actually travelled along his journey.[9]

At its publication,A Sentimental Journeywas reviewed as atravel narrativerather than anovel, and well-received in reviews for its fresh contributions to that genre.[9]In the 1760s,travel writingwas a popular literary genre, more respected than the novel.[19]Travel writing was also undergoing a popularizing shift, as older travel narratives likeJoseph Addison'sRemarks on several parts of Italy, &c.were regarded as overly focused onclassicalscholarship, which was uninteresting and inaccessible to middle-class audiences.[6]Travel narratives were rarely written by the small elite of aristocratic young men who went on a formalGrand Tour; instead, they were written by more middle-class travellers, whose journeys might have practical motivation.[6]To better entertain their readers, travel writers began to emphasize personal anecdotes over scholarship or practical guidebook catalogues, and each writer sought to cultivate a distinctive narrative voice.[6]Many stylistic aspects ofA Sentimental Journeytake these trends to their logical extreme.[6]In bothTristram ShandyandA Sentimental Journey, Sterne promotes the idea that travel (and travel writing) should prioritize social connection rather than formulaic sight-seeing.[10]A Sentimental Journeycan also be seen as an answer toTobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimentalTravels Through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modelled the character ofSmelfunguson Smollett.[20]

A structural feature taken from travel writing is the organization of the work into chapters named after the characters' location, rather than numbered sequentially.[21]A new chapter begins each time there is a change of scenery, even if Yorick remains in the same city, such that the chapters describe the boundaries of individual narrativetableaux.[21]Reinforcing this connection, the chapter titles usually add a short description of the key event in the scene.[21]A 1768 review in theCritical Reviewdescribes the use of ""whimsical titles"" for the chapters as an ""imitation of some celebrated authors"".[22]

A Sentimental Journeydescribes locations Sterne visited on his own travels,[6]but the title page ofA Sentimental Journeyidentifies the narrative as ""by Mr. Yorick.""[23]InTristram Shandy, Parson Yorick is a minor character with a melodramatically tragic story: he is rejected by the church for his sense of humour, and dies in poverty. The novel mourns him by presenting his epitaph (""Alas, poor YORICK!"") and printing a page of solid black.[24]Parson Yorick's unsuccessful clerical career mirrored Sterne's provincial obscurity as a clergyman beforeTristram Shandy, and Sterne was often publicly identified with Yorick.[25]Sterne published a collection of his own sermons under the titleThe Sermons of Mr. Yorick, with two volumes in 1760 and two more in 1766.[2]PublishingA Sentimental Journeyunder Yorick's name primed readers to expect the character's lighthearted but fundamentally moral perspective.[10]It also encouraged them to see Sterne himself as more like Yorick than the morally-questionable character of Tristram Shandy, which would improve Sterne's shaky reputation.[10]

AlthoughA Sentimental Journeywas considered less lewd than Sterne's previous novel, it is still characterized by frequent sexualized wordplay and events.[9]The novel does not treat sexual desire as incompatible with spiritual faith or moral goodness; instead, it suggests that desire is one way of encouraging people toward thepro-socialqualities of friendliness and generosity.[9][26]Several of Sterne's sermons present the idea that desire is granted to people by God, and that properly-directed desire promotes social harmony.[10]One of these sermons, ""The Levite and his Concubine"", is directly reworked inA Sentimental Journey.[10]

The interconnectedness of sympathy, sexual desire, and spirituality is particularly seen in Yorick's meeting with the peasant Maria.[27]Yorick seeks out the young and attractive Maria while she is alone in the countryside, mourning her lost husband; he finds her in tears, and is moved to tears himself. He uses his handkerchief to dry her eyes, and then his own, and then hers, and then his. In this moment, he ""felt such undescribable emotions within"" that he writes, ""I am positive I have a soul,"" rejecting thematerialistview that sees all human behaviour as ""combinations of matter and motion.""[23]This scene is often seen as sexually suggestive, particularly in Yorick's 'undescribable emotions'.[10]The scene is also sometimes seen as hyperbolic, calling Yorick's leap of logic into question.[10]However, in the context of eighteenth-century philosophic discourses, both tears and sexual desire can be understood as proof of an immaterial soul, because emotion is also immaterial.[28]

Sterne often presented the novel as one with a serious moral purpose, calling it his ""Work of Redemption"", and writing to a friend that the book would ""teach us to love the world and our fellow creatures better than we do.""[13]However, even in Sterne's day, readers have questioned the moral value of sentimental emotion.[29]Eighteenth-century sceptics of the sentimental movement particularly criticized the shallowness of moments where Yorick expresses emotion but takes no action.[30]In 1789,A Sentimental Journeywas parodied by the anonymous novelA Man of Failing, which also targetedHenry Mackenzie'sThe Man of Feeling.[31]

Several twentieth-century scholars have argued that Yorick's feelings and religious expressions are intentionally excessive, and that he ought to be read as anunreliable narrator.[32]In this reading, the novel constitutes a critique of sentimentalists like Yorick who express ostentatious feelings of sympathy without concretely assisting those in distress.[33]One scholar, Rufus Putney, describes the novel as ""a hoax by which Sterne persuaded his contemporaries that the humor he wanted to write was the pathos they wanted to read.""[7]Thomas Keymerargues inThe Cambridge Companion to Laurence Sternethat the novel is best understood as offering the reader both options, serious or satirical, depending on their tastes.[34]

Sterne's observations about French society were markedly lessxenophobicthan many English travel writers at the time. The war between France and Britain often prompted patriotic and nationalistic discourses about Britain's superiority. It was also conventional for the travel writer to comment on their homesickness for their home country as the best country, which Yorick entirely avoids doing.[6][9]

One indication that Sterne's attitude to France was more generous than that of his audience lies in the annotations of an unknown eighteenth-century reader. This reader added comments in the margins of their copy of the first edition, expressing their conviction that France was naturally plagued with poverty due to its absolutist and Catholic government. For example, when Yorick is in Paris this reader's annotations contrast Paris and London, ""one a place of total gaiety & dissipation the other of industry & business"".[35]

At the novel's publication in 1768, reviewers consideredA Sentimental Journeyto be an improvement over the recent volumes ofTristram Shandy, and praised Sterne's change of focus from humour to sentimentality.[13]Eighteenth-century readers also preferred it because it was less obviously sexual.[9]The Monthly Reviewreferred to it as his ""best production"", and said, ""the highest excellence of this genuine, this legitimate son of humour, lies not in his humorous but in hispatheticvein.""[10]The Political Registerwrote, ""Justly esteemed the best of the late Mr. Sterne's ingenious performances. To that original vein of humour which was so natural to him ... he has here added the moral and the pathetic; so that even while he is entertaining (as he always is) we are agreeably instructed.""[22]Reflecting this general taste, the authorHorace Walpoledescribed it as ""infinitely preferable to his tiresomeTristram Shandy"" due to its ""great good nature and delicacy,"" which appeals better to the ""heart of sensibility.""[13]More negative wasThe Critical Review, which complains that the book is ""calculated to instruct young travellers in what the author meant for thebon tonof pleasure and licentiousness.""[22]

A Sentimental Journeycontinued to be considered Sterne's best and most beloved work from Sterne's death through the early nineteenth century, and it was more widely reprinted thanTristram Shandy.[36]Its positive reputation was particularly promoted by the volume of extracts,The Beauties of Sterne, which was compiled by the print seller and publisherWilliam Hollandin 1782. This anthology included many passages praised for their emotional power.The Beauties of Sternewent through twelve editions in ten years.[36]

In addition to the professional commentary of reviewers, the eighteenth-century response to the novel can also be found in an annotated first edition ofA Sentimental Journey.[35]This unknown reader wrote their assessment at the bottom of the first page of the novel: ""Stern was certainly a most elastic genious, by his sudden trancisions from one extreme to the other, not allways to his advantage, from starts or sally's most sublime and elevated down to the most gross and beastly unpardonably as if he feard to be to highly admired.""[35]They object to the sentimental scene of the dead ass as ""forced & unnatural"", and they censor many of the novel's lewdest jokes.[35]To express their disapproval of the chapters ""The Rose"" and ""The Passport"", they initially glued several pages together to render them unreadable, then pried them open and blacked out the objectionable paragraphs line by line.[35]

By the mid-nineteenth century, the novel's reception grew more mixed, as Victorian readers were less tolerant of its 'indecencies'.[9]In 1819, the novel was added tothe Vatican's list of books prohibited by the Catholic Church.[13]The novelistWilliam Makepeace Thackerayinfluentially criticized its ""corruption"" in his 1852 public lectures, though some of his contemporaries resisted this assessment.[9][13]The literary criticLeslie Stephenalso objected to Sterne'sdouble entendres.[9]Despite these criticisms,A Sentimental Journeyhas never beenout of printsince its publication.[16]

In the early twentieth century, a new biography of Sterne and a decline in social conservatism prompted a re-evaluation of the novel.[13]It was particularly popular in the 1920s, when more than a dozen new editions were published.[13]Virginia Woolf, amodernistwriter, promoted a rejection of Victorian mores through her highly admiring introduction to a 1928 edition of the novel.[9]As others followed suit in embracing Sterne's proto-modernist experimentation with form,A Sentimental Journeywas often overshadowed byTristram Shandy, which attracted more scholarly attention for its more daring experiments inliterary form.[9]The firstscholarly monographaboutA Sentimental Journeywas W.B.C. Watkins'Perilous Balancein 1939.[13]Scholarship on the novel began to flourish in the 1960s and 70s.[13]Today,A Sentimental Journeyis studied for its role in the broader phenomenon of eighteenth centurysensibility.[9][13]

A Sentimental Journeyinspired a large number of illustrations, in the form of paintings, prints for sale, and decorated merchandise. Images of ""Poor Maria"" were particularly popular.[9][37]Angelica Kauffmann, an artist primarily known for herhistory paintings, paintedPoor Mariain 1777,[38]and printed copies were sold throughout Europe.[39][37]The porcelain companyWedgwoodcreated cameos of a similar ""Poor Maria"" image (and its companion shepherd portrait, the ""Bourbonnais Shepherd"") to decorate a wide range of products.[9][37]This best-selling motif appeared on personal adornments like brooches and shoe buckles, as well as household goods like teaware and vases.[9][37]In a portrait painted byÉlisabeth Vigée Le Brunin 1789, the Duchess of Orléans,Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, is depicted wearing a ""Poor Maria"" Wedgwood brooch at her waist.[37]The design was used onjasperwarebud vases as late as the 1960s.[40]

Other popular scenes for illustration were Yorick and thegrisette, the captive he imagines in the Bastille,[9]the old man and the ass, and the monk of Calais.[16]The monk formed the subject of the first painting based onA Sentimental Journey, exhibited in 1771.[16]Joseph Wright of Derby, best known for his images of theEnlightenmentsuch asA Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery,[41]made four paintings inspired by the novel: one version ofThe Captivein 1774, anotherCaptiveand a portrait of Maria in 1777, and a second portrait of Maria in 1781.[9]"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22341,The Wind in the Willows,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows,"With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, ""Hang spring cleaning!"" He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with ""Ratty"" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had ""read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends"".[12]

InThe Enchanted Places,Christopher Robin Milnewrote ofThe Wind in the Willows:

The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story. Dramatisations include:

Abridged readings:

Other presentation formats:

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that ""Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...""[34]

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9609,"Joseph Andrews, Vol. 2",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Andrews,"The novel begins with the affable, intrusive narrator outlining the nature of our hero. Joseph Andrews is the brother of Richardson's Pamela and is of the same rustic parentage and patchy ancestry. At the age of 10, he found himself tending animals as an apprentice to Sir Thomas Booby. In proving his worth as a horseman, he caught the eye of Sir Thomas's wife, Lady Booby, who now employs him (age 17) as her footman.

After Sir Thomas's death, Joseph finds his Lady's affections redoubled as she offers herself to him in her chamber while on a trip to London. In a scene analogous to many of Pamela's refusals of Mr. B in Richardson's novel, Lady Booby finds Joseph's Christian commitment to pre-maritalchastityunwavering. After suffering the Lady's fury, Joseph sends a letter to his sister much like Pamela's anguished missives in her own novel. The Lady makes one last attempt at seduction before dismissing him from both his job and his lodgings.

As Joseph sets out from London by moonlight, the narrator introduces the novel's heroine, Fanny Goodwill, Joseph's true love. A poor, illiterate girl of 'extraordinary beauty' (I, xi), now living with a farmer close to Lady Booby's parish, she and Joseph had grown ever closer since their childhood, before their local parson and mentor Abraham Adams recommended that they postpone marriage until they have the means to live comfortably.

On his way to see Fanny, Joseph is mugged and laid up in a nearby inn where, by coincidence, he is reunited with Parson Adams, who is on his way to London to sell three volumes of his sermons. The thief is found and brought to the inn (only to escape later that night), and Joseph is reunited with his possessions. Adams and Joseph catch up with each other, and the parson, in spite of his own poverty, offers his last9s 3½dto Joseph's disposal.

Joseph and Adams's stay in the inn is capped by one of many burlesque,slapstickdigressions in the novel. Betty, the inn's 21-year-oldchambermaid, had taken a liking to Joseph, but is doomed to disappointment by Joseph's constancy to Fanny. The landlord, Mr. Tow-wouse, who had always admired Betty, saw this disappointment as an opportunity to take advantage. Locked in an embrace, they are discovered by the choleric Mrs. Tow-wouse, who chases the maid through the house until Adams restrains her. With the landlord promising not to transgress again, his lady allows him to make his peace at the cost of ""quietly and contentedly bearing to be reminded of his transgressions, as a kind of penance, once or twice a day, during the residue of his life"" (I, xviii).

During his stay in the inn, Adams's hopes for his sermons are mocked in a discussion with a travelling bookseller and another parson. Nevertheless, Adams remains resolved to continue his journey to London until it is revealed that his wife, deciding that he would be more in need of shirts than sermons on his journey, has neglected to pack them. The pair thus decide to return to the parson's parish: Joseph in search of Fanny, and Adams in search of his sermons.

With Joseph following on horseback, Adams finds himself sharing a stage coach with an anonymous lady and Madam Slipslop, an admirer of Joseph's and a servant of Lady Booby. When they pass the house of a teenage girl named Leonora, the anonymous lady is reminded of a story and begins one of the novel's three interpolated tales, ""The History of Leonora, or the Unfortunate Jilt"". This continues for a number of chapters, punctuated by the questions and interruptions of the other passengers.

After stopping at an inn, Adams relinquishes his seat to Joseph, and forgetting his horse, sets out ahead on foot. Finding himself some time ahead of his friend, Adams rests by the side of the road where he becomes so engaged in conversation with a fellow traveller that he misses the stage coach as it passes. As the night falls and Adams and the stranger discourse on courage and duty, a shriek is heard. The stranger, having seconds earlier lauded the virtues of bravery and chivalry, makes his excuses and flees the scene without turning back. Adams, however, rushes to the girl's aid and after amock-epicstruggle knocks her attacker unconscious. In spite of Adams's good intentions, he and the girl, who reveals herself to be none other than Fanny Goodwill (in search of Joseph after hearing of his mugging), find themselves accused of assault and robbery.

After some comic litigious wrangling before the local magistrate, the pair are eventually released and depart shortly after midnight in search of Joseph. They do not have to walk far before a storm forces them into the same inn that Joseph and Slipslop have chosen for the night. Slipslop, her jealousy ignited by seeing the two lovers reunited, departs angrily. When Adams, Joseph and Fanny come to leave the following morning, they find their departure delayed by an inability to settle the bill, and, with Adams's solicitations of a loan from the local parson and his wealthy parishioners failing, it falls on a local peddler to rescue the trio by loaning them his last6s 6d.

The solicitations of charity that Adams is forced to make, and the complications which surround their stay in the parish, bring him into contact with many localsquires, gentlemen and parsons, and much of the latter part of Book II is taken up by discussions of literature, religion, philosophy and trade that result.

The three depart the inn by night, and it is not long before Fanny needs to rest. With the party silent, they overhear approaching voices agree on ""the murder of any one they meet"" (III, ii) and flee to a local house. Inviting them in, the owner, Mr. Wilson, informs them that the gang of supposed murderers were in fact sheep-stealers, intent more on the killing of livestock than of Adams and his friends. The party being settled, Wilson begins the novel's most lengthy interpolated tale by recounting his life story; a story which bears a notable resemblance to Fielding's own youth.

At the age of 16, Wilson's father died and left him a modest fortune. Finding himself the master of his destiny, he left school and travelled to London where he soon acquainted himself with the dress, manners and reputation for womanising necessary to consider himself a ""beau"". Wilson's life in the town is a façade: he writes love-letters to himself, obtains his fine clothes on credit, and is concerned more to be seen at the theatre than to watch the play. After two bad experiences with women, he is financially crippled, and much like Fielding, falls into the company of a group ofDeists,freethinkersand gamblers. Finding himself in debt, he, like Fielding, turns to the writing of plays andhack journalismto alleviate his financial problems. He spends his last few pence on a lottery ticket, but with no reliable income, is soon forced to exchange it for food. While in jail for his debts, news reaches him that the ticket he gave away has won a £3,000 prize. His disappointment is short-lived, however, as the daughter of the winner hears of his plight, pays off his debts, and, after a brief courtship, agrees to marry him.

Wilson found himself at the mercy of many of the social ills that Fielding had written about in his journalism: the over-saturated and abused literary market, the exploitative state lottery, and regressive laws which sanctioned imprisonment for small debts. Having seen the corrupting influence of wealth and the town, he retires with his new wife to the rural solitude in which Adams, Fanny and Joseph find them. The only break in his contentment, and one which turns out to be significant to the plot, was the kidnapping of his eldest son, whom he has not seen since.

Wilson promises to visit Adams when he passes through his parish, and after another mock-epic battle on the road, this time with a party ofhunting dogs, the trio proceed to the house of a local squire, where Fielding illustrates another contemporary social ill by having Adams subjected to a humiliatingroasting. Enraged, the three depart to the nearest inn to find that, while at the squire's house, they had been robbed of their lasthalf-guinea. To compound their misery, the squire has Adams and Joseph accused of kidnapping Fanny, to have them detained while he orders the abduction of the girl himself. She is rescued in transit, however, by Lady Booby's steward, Peter Pounce, and all four of them complete the remainder of the journey to Booby Hall together.

On seeing Joseph arrive back in the parish, a jealous Lady Booby meanders through emotions as diverse as rage, pity, hatred, pride and love. The next morning Joseph and Fanny'sbanns are publishedand the Lady turns her anger onto Parson Adams, who is accommodating Fanny at his house. Finding herself powerless either to stop the marriage or to expel them from the parish, she enlists the help of Lawyer Scout, who brings a spurious charge of larceny against Joseph and Fanny to prevent, or at least postpone the wedding.

Three days later, the Lady's plans are foiled by the visit of her nephew, Mr Booby, and a surprise guest: Booby has married Pamela, granting Joseph a powerful new ally and brother-in-law. What is more, Booby is an acquaintance of the justice presiding over Joseph and Fanny's trial, and instead ofBridewell, has them committed to his own custody. Knowing of his sister's antipathy to the two lovers, Booby offers to reunite Joseph with his sister and take him and Fanny into his own parish and his own family.

In a discourse with Joseph onstoicismandfatalism, Adams instructs his friend to submit to the will of God and control his passions, even in the face of overwhelming tragedy. In the kind of crueljuxtapositionusually reserved for Fielding's less savoury characters, Adams is informed that his youngest son, Jacky, has drowned. After indulging his grief in a manner contrary to his lecture a few minutes previously, Adams is informed that the report was premature, and that his son has in fact been rescued by the same peddler that loaned him his last few shillings in Book II.

Lady Booby, in a last-ditch attempt to sabotage the marriage, brings a young beau named Didapper to Adams's house to seduce Fanny. Fanny is unmoved by his bold attempts at courtship. Didapper is too bold in his approach and provokes Joseph into a fight. The Lady and the beau depart in disgust, but the peddler, having seen the Lady, is compelled to relate a tale. The peddler had met his wife while in the army, and she died young. While on her death bed, she confessed that she once stole an exquisitely beautiful baby girl from a family named Andrews, and sold her on to Sir Thomas Booby, thus raising the possibility that Fanny may in fact be Joseph's sister. The company is shocked, but there is general relief that the crime of incest may have been narrowly averted.

The following morning, Joseph and Pamela's parents arrive, and together with the peddler and Adams, they piece together the question of Fanny's parentage. The Andrews identify her as their lost daughter, but have a twist to add to the tale. When Fanny was an infant, she was indeed stolen from her parents, but the thieves left behind a sickly infant Joseph in return, who was raised as their own. It is immediately apparent that Joseph is the above-mentioned kidnapped son of Wilson, and when Wilson arrives on his promised visit, he identifies Joseph by abirthmarkon his chest. Joseph is now the son of a respected gentleman, Fanny an in-law of the Booby family, and the couple no longer suspected of being siblings. Two days later they are married by Adams in a humble ceremony, and the narrator, after bringing the story to a close, and in a disparaging allusion to Richardson, reassures readers that there will be no sequel.

Joseph Andrews, a stage adaptation of the first and fourth books of the novel, was written bySamuel Jackson Prattand performed on 20 April 1778 at theTheatre Royal, Drury Lane. The role of Fanny was played byMary Robinson.[1]

The novel wasadapted for the screenin 1977 byTony Richardson,Allan ScottandChris Bryant. Richardson directed the critically well-received work, withMichael Hordernas Adams,Peter Firthas Joseph, and Lady Booby played bySwedish-bornAnn-Margret, who received aGolden Globenomination for the role. The tag line (""The story of a young, English footman who served the Lady Booby but loved the little Fanny"") suggests how it captures some of the source material's bawdy humour. It was released onregion 1DVD in 2003.

A four-part radio adaption dramatised by John Scotney was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in April 1986.

A two-part adaptation,Joseph Andrews Remixed, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in July 2021. It was written by Shaun McKenna and incorporated a fictionalization of Fielding writing the novel with the help of his wife whilst the couple struggled for money in fear of retribution for some of Fielding's anonymous satires against the Tory government.

He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, awater vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with ""Ratty"" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grandToad Halland pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawncaravan. When a passingcarscares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad underhouse arrestwith themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over byweasels,stoats, andferretsfrom the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild godPanwhile searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators includePaul Bransom(1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927),Ernest H. Shepard(1931),Arthur Rackham(1940),Richard Cuffari(1966),Tasha Tudor(1966),Michael Hague(1980),Scott McKowen(2005), andRobert Ingpen(2007).

A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK byMethuen and Co., and later in the US byScribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works,The Golden AgeandDream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4]The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11]In 1909, then US PresidentTheodore Rooseveltwrote to Grahame to tell that he had ""read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends"".[12]

InThe Enchanted Places,Christopher Robin Milnewrote ofThe Wind in the Willows:

The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story. Dramatisations include:

Abridged readings:

Other presentation formats:

Mapledurham Housein Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall,[26]althoughHardwick HouseandFawley Courtalso make this claim.[27]

The village ofLerrynin Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.[28]

Simon Winchestersuggested that the character of Ratty was based onFrederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame.[29]However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer SirArthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch's daughter, Foy Felicia.[30]

The Scotsman[31]andOban Times[32]suggestedThe Wind in the Willowswas inspired by theCrinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood inArdrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside theRiver Pangin Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve atMoor Copse, nearTidmarshBerkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by theBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[33]

Peter Ackroyd, in his bookThames: Sacred River, asserts that ""Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] atCookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...""[34]

The following morning, he reads about a new scientific procedure for turning Black skin white called ""Black-No-More,"" and he decides to go through with the procedure, being the first to do so. As Max sees his face broadcast on the news for undergoing the procedure, he expresses concern, until remembering that he is now unrecognizable due to now being white.

As the Black-No-More procedure grows increasingly popular, it wreaks havoc on the social and economic institutions of Harlem, drawing resistance from leaders in the African American community. It also draws fierce resistance from Southern segregationist organizations, as the Southern economy rooted in Black labor collapses. Meanwhile, Max  —  who has now changed his name to Matthew Fisher  —  discovers that life as a white man is not as great as he imagined, with economic struggles remaining a constant in his life. In order to earn some money, he travels to Atlanta, Georgia, and joins Reverend Harry Givens'swhite supremacistorganization, The Knights of Nordica, claiming that he has the expertise necessary to help them end Black-No-More.

Incidentally, the woman who rejected Matthew at the beginning of the novel is Rev. Givens's daughter, Helen. Now that he is white and a prominent member of a white supremacist organization, Matthew wins Helen's affection and, eventually, her hand in marriage. This becomes dangerous for Matthew, however, when Helen becomes pregnant, raising the specter — faced by an increasing number of newly whitened individuals — of a non-white child betraying his true identity.

The Knights of Nordica break into politics, teaming up with the well-funded Anglo-Saxon Association, whose leader, Arthur Snobbcraft, shares the Democratic presidential ticket with Rev. Givens. With fewer and fewer Black individuals left for Snobbcraft and Givens to stake their racist positions against, they hire a statistician, Dr. Samuel Buggerie, to conduct a massive inquiry into the genealogy of American citizens and thereby taint their opponents as genealogically, if not epidermically, ""Black.""

After a miscarriage, Helen becomes pregnant again, prompting Matthew to keep an airplane and spare cash on hand for a quick escape whenever she happens to go into labor. He decides that, when she gives birth to what will inevitably be their Black child, he will ask her either to reject him outright, or to accept him for who he is and leave the country with him. However, with the genealogy project nearing completion on the eve of election day, the results indicate that almost all Americans have at least some African ancestry, including Snobbcraft, Buggerie, Givens, and Helen. These results are stolen by the Republicans and then leaked to the media. When Helen's child is born biracial, she blames herself for her undisclosed African-American heritage. Matthew then admits his own heritage, and she accepts him for who he is.

A violent mob forms when word spreads of Givens's and Snobbcraft's ""impure"" ancestry. Snobbcraft and Buggerie flee together on Matthew's airplane, but they are forced to land in Mississippi when they run out of fuel. Afraid of revealing their true identities, they blacken their faces with shoe-polish, which proves to be an unfortunate decision, as they encounter a group of local zealots who have been eagerly waiting for a Black person — any Black person — to kill. Givens and Snobbcraft remove their disguises and convince the zealots that they are, in fact, white, but just at this moment a newspaper arrives, divulging their true ancestry. Snobbcraft and Buggerie are mutilated and then burned alive.

In a flash-forward, Dr. Crookman, the creator of the Black-No-More procedure, announces that Black Americans who undergo the procedure appear lighter, which results in those with light skin facing discrimination, and having a darker skin tone becoming increasingly desired. As a result, both Black and white Americans begin staining their skin with the product ""ZuluTan"" to appear darker. The novel closes on a picture of Max and Helen's family, in which all are dark-skinned.[4]"

They hide this fromLady Constance, who is distracted with worries that the book of memoirs her brotherGalahadis writing will bring shame to the family.

Ronnie, meanwhile, is secretly engaged to Sue Brown, a chorus girl and an old friend of Hugo. When they run into Lady Constance in London one day, Ronnie introduces Sue as Myra Schoonmaker, an American heiress he and his mother Lady Julia recently met inBiarritz.

Ronnie travels to Blandings, whereBaxterhas just returned, called in by Lady Constance to steal the memoirs. Hoping to get money out of Lord Emsworth, his trustee, Ronnie claims to love pigs, but his uncle has seen him bouncing a tennis ball on theEmpress' back, and is enraged. Ronnie, inspired, steals the pig, planning to return it and earn his uncle's gratitude, roping inBeachto help; they hide her in a cottage in the woods.

Hugo is sent to London to fetch a detective; the job is refused byPercy Pilbeam. Hugo takes Sue out dancing, but when Ronnie arrives at the club he sees Pilbeam, who admires Sue, sat at her table. Ronnie gets angry at Pilbeam, makes a scene, spends a night in jail, and in the morning snubs Sue, who he believes has betrayed him. Millicent, feeling the same about Hugo, breaks off their engagement also. Meanwhile, SirGregory Parsloe-Parsloe, worrying about the memoirs, hires Pilbeam to retrieve them; Pilbeam agrees, realising he can use the pig-finding job to get into the castle.

Sue heads to Blandings, posing as Myra Schoonmaker. Just after her arrival, Mortimer Mason, Sue's employer, visits Galahad in the library to discuss the memoirs. He recognizes Sue in the garden and talks about her, so Galahad learns her true identity, sharing the knowledge only with Sue. Percy Pilbeam arrives, recognises Sue, and tries to get her help in his memoir-stealing scheme. Baxter, meanwhile, has grown suspicious that the pig was stolen by Carmody as a means of insuring his job; he spots Beach heading off to feed the pig, and follows him, just as the storm breaks.

Beach reaches the cottage to find Hugo and Millicent, gone there to shelter from the rain. Their relationship is healed, Hugo having explained about Sue and Ronnie, and Beach, protecting Ronnie, claims he stole the pig for Hugo to return and win Lord Emsworth's favour. Beach leaves, as Carmody takes the pig to a new hiding spot.

Baxter accuses Beach in front of Emsworth, and the three of them head to the cottage, Emsworth growing ever warier of Baxter's sanity. They find no pig, Carmody having moved it to Baxter's caravan, where Pilbeam, also caught in the rain, saw him stow it. While Emsworth, Lady Constance, Gally and Millicent go to dinner with Parsloe-Parsloe (lured away to leave the memoirs unguarded), Ronnie Fish confronts Pilbeam, and learns that Sue was indeed out in London with Carmody, and that she has come to Blandings to be near Ronnie.

Pilbeam gets tipsy, and tells Beach about Sue, and then tells Carmody that he saw him hide the pig. Carmody, in a panic, calls Millicent atMatchingham Hall; she advises him to tell Emsworth where the pig is at once. He does so, Emsworth is overjoyed, and agrees to their marriage, much to Lady Constance's disgust.

Meanwhile, Baxter intercepts a telegram meant for Lady Constance from Myra Schoonmaker in Paris, and goes to the imposter Sue's room to retrieve a note he sent her, criticising Lord Emsworth. Trapped by Beach bringing her dinner, he hides under the bed while she and Ronnie are reunited. Ronnie spots Pilbeam climbing into the room to steal Galahad's memoirs, and chases him downstairs; the returning dinner party assume they are fleeing Baxter, now confirmed as mad by the presence of the stolen pig in his caravan, and Emsworth charges into Sue's room with a shotgun. Baxter crawls out from under the bed, flustered and enraged by his experience and Emsworth's harsh words, reveals Sue's deception and storms off.

Galahad, learning that Sue Brown is Dolly Henderson's daughter, reveals that he loved her mother but was forbidden to marry her, and views Sue as a kind of honorary daughter. He tells Lady Constance that he will suppress his book if she agrees to sanction Sue and Ronnie's marriage, and to persuade her sister Julia to do likewise. Pilbeam, hearing this as he once again climbs the drainpipe, gives up his mission, leaving Galahad to tell Sue the old story of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe and the prawns.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2027,"Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartuffe,"Orgon's family is up in arms because Orgon and his mother have fallen under the influence of Tartuffe, a pious fraud (and a vagrant prior to Orgon's help).  Tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority, and Orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him.

Tartuffe's antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends; they detest him. Orgon raises the stakes when he announces that Tartuffe will marry Orgon's daughter Mariane (who is already engaged to Valère).  Mariane becomes very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply Tartuffe has embedded himself into the family.

In an effort to show Orgon how awful Tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap Tartuffe into confessing to Elmire (Orgon's wife) his desire for her. As a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, Orgon will throw Tartuffe out of the house. Indeed, Tartuffe does try to seduce Elmire, but their interview is interrupted when Orgon's son Damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce Tartuffe.

Tartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well.  When Orgon enters the room and Damis triumphantly tells him what happened, Tartuffe usesreverse psychologyand accuses himself of being the worst sinner:

Orgon is convinced that Damis was lying and banishes him from the house. Tartuffe even convinces Orgon to order that, to teach Damis a lesson, Tartuffe should be around Elmire more than ever. As a gift to Tartuffe and further punishment to Damis and the rest of his family, Orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to Tartuffe.

In a later scene, Elmire challenges Orgon to be witness to a meeting between her and Tartuffe. Orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that Elmire is wrong. He overhears Elmire resisting Tartuffe's very forward advances. When Tartuffe has incriminated himself definitively and is dangerously close to violating Elmire, Orgon comes out from under the table and orders Tartuffe out of his house. The wily guest means to stay, and Tartuffe finally shows his hand. It turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, Orgon had admitted to Tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). Tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells Orgon that he (Orgon) will be the one to leave. Tartuffe takes his temporary leave. Orgon's family tries to decide what to do. Very soon, Monsieur Loyal shows up with a message from Tartuffe and the court itself; they must exit the house because it now belongs to Tartuffe. Dorine makes fun of Monsieur Loyal's name, mocking his fake loyalty. Even Madame Pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about Tartuffe even in the face of her son's actually witnessing it, has become convinced of Tartuffe's duplicity.

No sooner does Monsieur Loyal leave than Valère rushes in with the news that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that Orgon is about to be arrested. Before Orgon can flee, Tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise, the officer arrests him instead. The officer explains that the enlightened KingLouis XIV—who is not mentioned by name—has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by Tartuffe's treachery towards Orgon, has ordered Tartuffe's arrest instead.

It is revealed that Tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. As a reward for Orgon's previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave Tartuffe possession of Orgon's house and possessions. The entire family is thankful that it has escaped the mortification of both Orgon's potential disgrace and their dispossession.

The drama ends well, and Orgon announces the upcoming wedding of Valère and Mariane. The surprisetwist ending, in which everything is set right by the unexpected benevolent intervention of the heretofore unseen king, is considered a notable modern-day example of the classical theatrical plot devicedeus ex machina.

ThoughTartuffewas received well by the public and even by Louis XIV, it immediately sparked conflict amongst many different groups who were offended by the play's portrayal of someone who was outwardly pious but fundamentally mercenary, lecherous, and deceitful; and who uses their profession of piety to prey on others. The factions opposed to Molière's work included part of the hierarchy of theFrench Roman Catholic Church, members of upper-class French society, and the illegal underground organization called theCompagnie du Saint-Sacrement.Tartuffe's popularity was cut short when thearchbishop of ParisPéréfixeissued an edict threatening excommunication for anyone who watched, performed in, or read the play. Molière attempted to assuage church officials by rewriting his play to seem more secular and less critical of religion, but the archbishop and other leading officials would not budge. The revised, second version of the play was calledL'Imposteurand had a main character named Panulphe instead of Tartuffe, the only performance of which occurred in the Palais-Royal theatre on 5 August 1667. Immediately the following day, on 6 August, as the king was away from Paris,Guillaume de Lamoignon, first president of theParis Parlement, censored public performances.[5]

Even throughout Molière's conflict with the church, Louis XIV continued to support the playwright; it is possible that without the King's support, Molière might have beenexcommunicated. Although public performances of the play were banned, private performances for the Frencharistocracydid occur.[6]In 1669, after Molière's detractors lost much of their influence, he was finally allowed to perform the final version of his play. However, due to all thecontroversysurroundingTartuffe, Molière mostly refrained from writing such incisive plays as this one again.[7]

An ally of Molière (believed by Robert McBride to beFrançois de La Mothe Le Vayer, but a hotly-debated point)[8][9]responded to criticism ofTartuffein 1667 with aLettre sur la comédie de l'Imposteur. The anonymous author sought to defend the play[a]to the public by describing the plot in detail and then rebutting two common arguments made for why the play was banned. The first being that theatrical works should not discuss religion at all; the second being that Tartuffe's actions on stage, followed by his pious speech, would make the audience think that they were to act as Tartuffe did. This section of letter contradicts the latter by describing how Tartuffe's actions are worthy ofridicule, in essence comic, and therefore by no means an endorsement.[citation needed]

Centuries later, when thesatiricalanticlericalmagazineLa Calottestarted publication in 1906, its first editorial asserted thatLaughter is the only weapon feared by the soldiers of Tartuffe; the new magazine proposed to effectively deploy that weapon, with articles and cartoons mercilessly lampooning the Catholic Church and its clergy.[11][12][13]

The original version of the play was in three acts and was first staged on 12 May 1664 at thePalace of Versailles' Cour de Marbre[14]as part offestivitiesknown asLes Plaisirs de l'île enchantée. Because of the attacks on the play and the ban that was placed on it, this version was never published, and no text has survived, giving rise to much speculation as to whether it was a work in progress or a finished piece. Many writers believe it consisted of the first three acts of the final version, whileJohn Cairncrosshas proposed that acts 1, 3, and 4 were performed.[15]Although the original version could not be played publicly, it could be given privately,[15]and it was seen on 25 September 1664 inVillers-Cotterêts, for Louis' brotherPhilippe I, Duke of Orléans, akaMonsieurand 29 November 1664 at theChâteau du Raincy, for the veteran of theFronde,Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti.[16]

The second version,L'Imposteur, was in five acts and performed only once, on 5 August 1667 in theThéâtre du Palais-Royal. On 11 August, before any additional performances, theArchbishop of ParisPéréfixe banned this version also. The largely-final, revised third version in five acts, under the titleTartuffe, ou L'Imposteur, appeared on 5 February 1669 at the Palais-Royal theatre and was highly successful.[15]This version was published[17]and is the one that is generally performed today.[15]

Since Molière's time,Tartuffehas stayed on the repertoire of theComédie-Française, where it is its most performed play.[18]

Algernon Moncrieff's flat inHalf Moon Street

Algernon Moncrieff, a youngman about town, is visited by a friend whom he knows by the name of Ernest Worthing. The latter has come from the country to propose to Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax. Algernon refuses to consent until Ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription, ""From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack"". Worthing is forced to admit to living a double life. In the country, he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his youngward, theheiressCecily Cardew, and goes by the name of John or Jack, while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother in London, named Ernest. Meanwhile, he assumes the identity of the profligate Ernest when in town. Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have a sickly friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can ""visit"" whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.[2]

Gwendolen and her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, now call on Algernon, who distracts Lady Bracknell in another room while Jack proposes to Gwendolen. She accepts but says she could not love him if his name were not Ernest. He resolves secretly to be rechristened. Discovering the two in this intimate exchange, Lady Bracknell interviews Jack as a prospective suitor for her daughter. Horrified to learn that he was adopted – having been found as a baby in a handbag deposited atVictoria Stationin London – she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter. Gwendolen manages to covertly promise to him her undying love. As Jack gives her his address in the country, Algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve: Jack's revelation of his pretty young ward has motivated his friend to meet her.[3]

The Garden of the Manor House, Woolton

Cecily is studying with her governess, Miss Prism, in the (fictitious) village of Woolton, Hertfordshire. Algernon arrives, pretending to be Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by her uncle Jack's hitherto-absent dissolute brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest. Algernon plans for therector, Dr Chasuble, to rechristen him ""Ernest"". Jack has decided to abandon his double life. He arrives in full mourning and announces his brother's death in Paris, from a severe chill, a story undermined by Algernon's presence in the guise of Ernest. Gwendolen now enters, having left the Bracknells' London house without her mother's knowledge. During the temporary absence of the two men she meets Cecily. They get along well at first, but when they learn of the other's engagement each indignantly declares that she is the one engaged to Ernest. When Jack and Algernon reappear together, Gwendolen and Cecily realise they have been deceived; they leave the men in the garden and withdraw to the house.[4]

Morning-room at the Manor House, Woolton

Gwendolen and Cecily forgive the men's trickery. Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of Cecily's wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell's initial doubts over the young lady's suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by herguardian, Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen – something she declines to do.

The impasse is resolved by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell recognises as the person who, 28 years earlier as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy out in aperambulatorfrom Lord Bracknell's house and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absent-mindedly put into the perambulator the manuscript of a novel she was writing, and put the baby in a handbag, which she later left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the eldest son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, Mrs Moncrieff, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as Gwendolen's suitor.[5]

Gwendolen continues to insist that she can love only a man named Ernest. Lady Bracknell tells Jack that, as the firstborn, he would have been named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack examines theArmy Listsand discovers that his father's name – and hence his own original christening name – was, in fact, Ernest. As the happy couples embrace – Ernest and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism – Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: ""My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality"". He replies, ""On the contrary, Aunt Augusta: I've now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest"".[6]

The Importance of Being Earnestfollowed the success of Wilde's earlierdrawing room plays,Lady Windermere's Fan(1892),A Woman of No Importance(1893)  andAn Ideal Husband(1895).[7]He spent the summer of 1894 with his family atWorthing, on theSussexcoast, where he began work on the new play.[8]

Wilde scholars generally agree that the most important influence on the play wasW. S. Gilbert's 1877farceEngaged,[9]from which Wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also, in the words of Russell Jackson in his 1980 introduction to Wilde's play, ""the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors"".[10]Wilde's first draft was so long that it filled fourexercise books, and over the summer he continually revised and refined it, as he had done with his earlier plays.[11][12]Among his many changes he altered the subtitle from ""a Serious Comedy for Trivial People"" to ""a Trivial Comedy for Serious People"",[13]and renamed the characters Lady Brancaster and Algernon Montford as Lady Bracknell and Algernon Moncrieff.[14]

Wilde wrote the part of John Worthing with the actor-managerCharles Wyndhamin mind. Wilde sharedBernard Shaw'sview that Wyndham was the ideal comedy actor and based the character on his stage persona.[7]Wyndham accepted the play for production athis theatre, but before rehearsals began, he changed his plans in order to help a beleaguered colleague, the actor-managerGeorge Alexanderof theSt James's Theatre. In early 1895 Alexander's production ofHenry James'sGuy Domvillefailed, and closed after 31 performances, leaving Alexander in urgent need of a new play to follow it.[15][16]Wyndham waived his contractual rights and allowed Alexander to stage Wilde's play.[16][17]

After working with Wilde on stage movements, using a model theatre, Alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde complied and combined elements of the second and third acts.[18]The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to serve awriton the profligate ""Ernest"" Worthing for unpaid dining bills at theSavoy Hotel.[11][19]Wilde was not entirely happy with alterations made at Alexander's behest. He said, ""Yes, it is quite a good play. I remember I wrote one very like it myself, but it was even more brilliant than this"",[18]but the three-act version usually performed is widely considered more effective than Wilde's four-act original.[20][21][n 1]

The play was first produced at the St James's Theatre, London, on 14 February –Valentine's Day– 1895,[22]preceded by acurtain-raiser, a short comedy calledIn the Season, byLangdon E. Mitchell.[23]During most of the month-long rehearsal period Wilde was on holiday in Algeria with his gay partner,Lord Alfred Douglas, but he returned in time for thedress rehearsalon 12 February.[24]Douglas remained in Algiers; his father, theMarquess of Queensberry, planned to disrupt the premiere by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end. Wilde learned of the plan and Alexander cancelled Queensberry's ticket and arranged for the police to bar his entrance. Wilde wrote to Douglas, ""He arrived with aprize fighter!![n 2]I had allScotland Yardto guard the theatre. He prowled around for three hours, then left chattering like a monstrous ape"".[26]Queensberry left the bouquet at the theatre entrance.[25]

Wilde arrived for the premiere dressed in ""florid sobriety"", wearing agreen carnationin his lapel.[27]Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled toHesketh Pearson:

The theatrical newspaperThe Erareported that the play ""met with enthusiastic and unanimous approval"" and confidently predicted ""a long and prosperous run"".[23]Aynesworth was ""debonair and stylish"", and Alexander, who played Jack Worthing, ""demure"";[29]according toThe Era, ""Mr George Alexander played Worthing just as a part of this sort should be played, i.e., with entire seriousness and no indication of purposed irony"".[23]The Morning Postsaid thatIrene VanbrughandEvelyn Millardcould not be bettered and caught the required Gilbertian tone.[30]The Observerremarked on the ""rapturous amusement"" of the audience, and echoedThe Era's prediction of a long run.[31]

According to the published text, the characters, descriptions and cast comprised:[32][1]

Queensberry continued harassing Wilde, who within weeks launched aprivate prosecutionagainst him forcriminal libel, triggering aseries of trialsthat revealed Wilde's homosexual private life and ended in his imprisonment forgross indecencyin May 1895. TheVictorianpublic turned against him after his arrest, and box-office receipts dwindled rapidly;[34][35]Alexander tried to save the production by removing the author's name from the playbills,[n 4]but it closed on 8 May after only 83 performances.[24][37]

The play's originalBroadwayproduction opened at theEmpire Theatreon 22 April 1895 but closed after sixteen performances. Its cast includedWilliam Favershamas Algernon,Henry Milleras Jack,Viola Allenas Gwendolen and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell.[38]The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented byRobert BroughandDion Boucicault Jr., with Cecil Ward as Jack, Boucicault as Algernon and Jenny Watt-Tanner as Lady Bracknell. The production was an immediate success.[39][40]Wilde's downfall in England did not affect the popularity of his plays in Australia.[41][n 5]The same company presented the New Zealand premiere in October 1895, when the play was enthusiastically received. Reviewers said, ""in subtlety of thought, brilliancy of wit and sparkling humour, it has scarcely been excelled"";[42]and ""its fun is irresistible ... increasing in intensity until in the third and last act it becomes uproarious"".[43]

In contrast with much theatre of the time, the light plot ofThe Importance of Being Earnestdoes not address serious social and political issues,  and this troubled some contemporary reviewers. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity.[44]Shaw found the play ""extremely funny"" but ""heartless"", a view he maintained all his life.[45][n 6]His review in theSaturday Reviewargued that comedy should touch as well as amuse: ""I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter, not to be tickled or bustled into it"".[47]

InThe World,William Archerwrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: ""What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?""[48]InThe Speaker,A. B. Walkleyadmired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied that the term ""farce"" was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said, ""It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen"".[49]

H. G. Wells, in an unsigned review forThe Pall Mall Gazette, called the play one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying, ""More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine"".[50]He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, ""... how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously"".[50]The play was so light-hearted that some reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama.W. H. Audenlater (1963) called it ""a pure verbal opera"", andThe Timescommented, ""The story is almost too preposterous to go without music"".[29]Mary McCarthy, inSights and Spectacles(1959), despite thinking the play extremely funny, called it ""a ferocious idyll""; ""depravity is the hero and the only character"".[51]

As Wilde's works came to be read and performed again in the early 20th century, it wasThe Importance of Being Earnestthat received the most productions.[52]The critic and authorMax Beerbohmcalled the play Wilde's ""finest, most undeniably his own"", saying that the plots of his other comedies –Lady Windermere's Fan,A Woman of No ImportanceandAn Ideal Husband– follow the manner ofVictorien Sardou,[n 7]and are similarly unrelated to the theme of the work, while inThe Importance of Being Earnestthe story is ""dissolved"" into the form of the play.[54]By the time of its centenary in 1995 the journalistMark Lawsondescribed the piece as ""the second most known and quoted play in English afterHamlet"".[55]

The Importance of Being Earnestand Wilde's three other drawing room plays were performed in Britain during the author's imprisonment and exile by small touring groups. A. B. Tapping's company touredThe Importancebetween October 1895 and March 1896,[n 8]and Elsie Lanham's touring company presented it along withLady Windermere's Fan, beginning in November 1899.[57]The play was well received; one local critic described it as ""sparkling with wit and epigrams"",[58]and another called it ""a most entertaining comedy [with] some sparkling dialogue"".[59]

The play was not seen again in London until after Wilde's death in 1900. Alexander revived it in the small Coronet theatre inNotting Hill, outside the West End, in December the following year,[60]after taking it on tour, starring as John Worthing, with a cast that included the youngLilian Braithwaiteas Cecily.The Manchester Guardiancalled the piece ""a brilliant play"".[61]The Importance of Being Earnestreturned to the West End when Alexander presented a revival at the St James's in 1902. It was billed as ""By the author ofLady Windermere's Fan"", and few reviews mentioned Wilde's name, but his work was praised.The Sporting Timessaid:"

He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes himwhitewashher fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him smalltrinketsand treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his work, usingreverse psychologyto convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in hisSunday schoolclass for tickets given out for memorizing verses ofScripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prizedBiblefrom the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.

Tom falls in love withBecky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get ""engaged"" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was ""engaged"" to another schoolgirl,Amy Lawrence.

Becky spurns Tom, who accompaniesHuckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform aritualintended to healwarts. At the graveyard, they witness threebody snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter andInjun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potterunconsciousand is thenmurderedby Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear ablood oathnot to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe's claim.

Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson's Island in theMississippi Riverto begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing andpresumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his ownfuneral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing atchurchin the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master'sanatomybook after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting thepunishmentthat would have been hers.

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Ashford wrote the novel in an exercise book at the age of nine in 1890.  Full of spelling mistakes, each chapter was written as a single paragraph.  Many years later, in 1917 and aged 36, Ashford rediscovered her manuscript languishing in a drawer, and lent it to Margaret Mackenzie, a friend who was recovering from influenza. It passed through several other hands before it reachedFrank Swinnerton, a novelist who was also a reader for the publishersChatto and Windus.  Largely due to Swinnerton's enthusiasm for this piece ofjuvenilia, the book was published almost exactly as it had been written.J. M. Barrie, the creator ofPeter Pan, agreed to write a preface.[2]

The original manuscript ofThe Young Visitersis held in the Berg Collection of theNew York Public Library.[3]

The book was so successful that it had been reprinted 19 times by 1936. After its publication, rumours soon started that the book was in fact an elaborate literary hoax and that it had been written by J. M. Barrie himself. These rumours persisted for years.[2]

A stage play ofThe Young Visitersby Mrs George Norman and Margaret Mackenzie was first performed in London in 1920 and transferred shortly afterwards to New York.  The New York production, at the Thirty-Ninth Street Theatre, received generally good reviews. One reviewer stated that

A two-act musical comedy version,Quite a Young GirlbyAlicen White,Martha D Coeand Peter Colonna, was written in 1960. Whilst it received the author’s blessing, they ultimately failed to find a producer.[5]

A musical by Michael Ashton andIan Kellambased on the book was produced in 1968.[6]

A feature-length film was made in 1984 starringTracey UllmanandJohn Standing.

A television film version was made by theBBCin 2003 starringJim Broadbentas Alfred Salteena,Lyndsey Marshalas Ethel Monticue andHugh Laurieas Lord Bernard Clark. The screenplay was written byPatrick Barlowand it was directed byDavid Yates.[7]

Evelyn Waughmentions the book in his novelA Handful of Dust(1934) as part of the childhood reading of his hero Tony Last.

The criticEdmund Wilsonreferred to the novelThis Side of Paradise(1920) by his friendF. Scott Fitzgeraldas ""a classic in a class withThe Young Visiters"", meaning that Fitzgerald's book had a rather naive style.[8]

Elizabeth MacKintoshwriting asJosephine Teymentions the book in her novelMiss Pym Disposes(1947) as a book ""that makes everyone smile"".

Margaret MacMillanin her history of the Paris Peace Conference ""Paris 1919;  Six Months That Changed The World"" mentions in passing (page 73) that ""The Young Visiters"",  ""a comic novel written by a child"",  was ""the most popular book of 1919""."
Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67369,Hadrian the Seventh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian_the_Seventh,"The prologue introduces us to George Arthur Rose (a transparent doublefor Rolfe himself): a failed candidate for thepriesthooddenied his vocation by the machinations and bungling of theRoman Catholicecclesiastical machinery, and now living alone with his little yellow cat.

Rose is visited by two prominent churchmen, one aCardinal Archbishop. The two propose to right the wrongs done to him, ordain him a priest, and take him toRomewhere the Conclave to elect the new Pope has reached deadlock. When he arrives in Rome he finds that the Cardinals have been inspired toelect himas Pope. He accepts, and since the only previous English Pope wasAdrian (or Hadrian) IV, he takes the name Hadrian VII.

The novel develops with this unconventional, chain-smoking Englishman peremptorily reforming the Church and the early 20th-century world, against inevitable opposition from the established Roman Catholichierarchy, rewarding his friends and trouncing his enemies; generally he gets his way by charm or doggedness. His short reign is brought to an end when he is assassinated by aScotsman, or possibly anUlsterman, and the world breathes a sigh of relief.

In 1908 Rolfe resurrected the character of Hadrian forThe Bull Against the Enemy of the Anglican Race, a violent attack onLord Northcliffeand his newspaper, theDaily Mail, cast in the form of aPapal Bullissued by Hadrian VII.

The novel was made into a successful stage-play byPeter Luke, opening at theMermaid Theatre, London in April 1968 and starringAlec McCowenas Fr. William Rolfe (not Rose).  The subsequent Broadway production at theold Helen Hayes Theatrestarred first McCowen, thenRoderick Cook, and later,Barry Morse.  It was also Morse who played in an Australian production and a USA national tour.[citation needed]In 1972, the play was also staged at theVancouver Playhouse.[2]

A satirical novel on a similar theme, which mentionsHadrian the Seventhin its bibliography, isRobert Player'sLet's Talk of Graves, of Worms, of Epitaphs(1972).

The Translation of Father Torturo(2005), a novel byBrendan Connellabout a priest's ruthless ascent to the papacy, is dedicated to ""Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe, Baron Corvo"", ""for the design which I so meanly twisted"".

In 2014,The GuardianplacedHadrian the Seventhon its list of the 100 best novels written in English.Robert McCrumcalled it ""entertaining if contrived […]orchidaceous, eccentric and weirdly obsessive, some would say mad.""[3]"

Shortly after, a rich uncle also dies. This uncle hated Brewster's grandfather, a long-held grudge stemming from the grandfather's disapproval of the marriage of Brewster's parents.  The uncle will leave Brewster seven million dollars, but only under the condition that he keeps none of the grandfather's money. Brewster is required to spend every penny of his grandfather's million within one year, resulting in no assets or property held from the wealth at the end of that time. If Brewster meets these terms, he will gain the full seven million; if he fails, he remains penniless.

Brewster finds that spending so much money within the course of a year is incredibly difficult under the strict conditions imposed by his uncle's will.  Brewster is required to demonstrate business sense by obtaining good value for the money he spends, limiting his donations to charity, his losses to gambling, and the value of his tips to waiters and cab drivers. Moreover, Brewster is sworn to secrecy, and cannot tell anyone why he is living to excess. Working against him are his well-meaning friends, who try repeatedly to limit his losses and extravagance even as they share in his luxurious lifestyle.

Brewster's challenge is compounded by the fact that his attempts to lose money through stock speculation and roulette prove to increase his funds rather than decrease them. He throws large parties and balls, and charters a cruise lasting several months to Europe and Egypt for his large circle of friends and employees; the press lampoons him as a spendthrift. Despite his loose purse strings, Brewster repeatedly demonstrates a strong moral character. At one point, he uses his funds to bail out a bank to save his landlady's account, despite risking his eligibility for the will. At another, he jumps overboard to save a drowning sailor from his cruise even as his rich friends choose not to.

Brewster's would-be wife Barbara Drew turns down his marriage proposal early in the year, believing him to be financially irresponsible and bound to a life of poverty, and his attempts to win her back repeatedly fail as his attention is entirely absorbed by the requirement to spend so much money. At the conclusion of the year, he succeeds in spending the last of his funds, which he has meticulously documented, and confesses his love to another woman, Peggy Gray, who has been sympathetic to his lifestyle despite knowing nothing about his challenge. Disaster strikes the night before the deadline, as his lawyers informed him that the executor of his uncle's will has vanished after liquidating all of the assets.  Brewster convinces himself that he is doomed to poverty, but marries Peggy Gray, who accepts him despite the lack of wealth. Shortly after the wedding, the executor of his uncle's will arrives to inform him that he has successfully met the challenge and that he has come to deliver the money to Brewster in person."

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23625,The Magic Pudding,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Pudding,"Wanting to see the world and unable to live with his uncle anymore, Bunyip Bluegum thekoalasets out on his travels, taking only awalking stick. At about lunchtime, feeling more than slightly peckish, he meets Bill Barnacle thesailorand Sam Sawnoff theEmperor penguinwho are eating a magicsteak and kidney puddingwhich, no matter how much one eats it, always reforms into a whole pudding again. The pudding is called Albert, has thin arms and legs, and is bad-tempered and ill-mannered. His only pleasure is being eaten and on his insistence, Bill and Sam invite Bunyip to join them for lunch. They then set off on the road together, Bill explaining to Bunyip how he and Sam were once shipwrecked with a ship's cook on anicebergwhere the cook created the pudding which they now own.

Later on they encounter the Pudding Thieves, apossumnamed Patrick and awombatnamed Watkin. Bill and Sam bravely defend their pudding while Bunyip sits on Albert so that he cannot escape while they are not looking. Later that night sitting round the fire, Bill and Sam, grateful for his contributions of the day, invite Bunyip to join them and become a member of the Noble Society of Pudding Owners.

Later the next day, through some well-thought-out trickery, the Pudding Thieves make a successful grab for the Pudding. Upset and outraged, Bill and Sam fall into despair and it is up to Bunyip to get them to pull themselves together and set off to rescue their Pudding. In the course of tracking down the Pudding Thieves they encounter some rather pathetic and unsavoury members of society, but eventually manage to get led to the Pudding Thieves' lair. Bunyip's cleverness lures the robbers into a trap from where Bill and Sam's fists do the rest and they retrieve their pudding.

Some time later the Pudding Thieves approach the three Pudding Owners proclaiming that they bear gifts of good will and will present them to the pudding owners if they would only look inside a bag they have with them. When doing so they pull it over their heads and tie it up leaving them defenceless as the thieves take their pudding and run off.

An elderlyBasset hound, market gardener Benjamin Brandysnap, comes along and frees the Pudding Owners. The bag had been stolen from his stable, and he joins the Pudding Owners to get revenge on the Pudding Thieves. Another clever plan by Bunyip lures them into another trap where the Thieves are given yet another battering and the Pudding retrieved.

The next day the travellers come to the sleepy town of Tooraloo where they are approached by men dressed in suits and top hats and claiming to be the real owners of the Pudding. They turn out to be the Pudding Thieves up to yet another attempt at getting the Pudding and the subsequent fight brings along the Mayor and the cowardly localConstable. In the argument that follows, the bad-tempered Pudding pinches the Mayor, who orders his arrest.

The Pudding is taken to court where the only officials present are the judge and theusherwho are playing cards, but they prefer to eat the defendant rather than hear the case. To settle matters, Bunyip suggests that they hear the case themselves. Bill becomes theprosecutor, the Pudding Thieves are charged with the attempts to steal the Pudding and the theft of Benjamin Brandysnap's bag and the Mayor and the Constable stand in as “12 good men and true” — conceding that the unconstitutionality of the court is ""better than a punch on the snout"". The proceedings do not go well however, and result in utter chaos. When it is at its height, Bunyip suddenly announces that the Pudding has been poisoned. The judge, who has been eating away at the Pudding, goes suddenly crazy and attacks the usher, the Pudding Thieves, the Mayor and the Constable with a bottle ofport.

In reality, Albert was never poisoned and the Pudding Owners take advantage of the confusion to beat a hasty retreat. They then decide that it would be best to settle down somewhere rather than continue with their travelling. They build a house in a tree in Benjamin's garden and settle down to a life of ease.

Norman Lindsay, a well-known artist, illustrated the book himself with numerous black and white drawings, and also designed the cover. The original sketches can be seen at theState Library of New South Wales.[1]

The Magic Pudding Sculpture by Louis Laumen, based on Lindsay's illustrations, is the centrepiece of theIan PotterChildren's Garden in theRoyal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.[2]

The Magic Puddingis said to have been written to settle an argument: Lindsay's friendBertram Stevenssaid that children like to read about fairies, while Lindsay asserted that they would rather read about food and fighting.[3][4]

First published in 1918,The Magic Puddingis considered a children's classic, ""frequently compared in its appeal to Lewis Carroll'sAlice in Wonderland,[5]to and continues to be reprinted. The first edition was sold as a ‘guinea book’ (21 shillings). It was a limited edition quality art book.[6]Out-of-print outside Australia for many years, the book was re-issued in 2004 byThe New York Review Children's Collection.[7]In Australia a new edition was released in 2008 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the book, and October 12 was declared ""Pudding Day"";[8]this new 2008 edition featured the original artwork as well as a biography, the first book reviews, letters between Lindsay and his publisher, and various recipes.[9]In 2018HarperCollinsreleased a centenary edition, and the State Library of New South Wales opened an exhibition of Lindsay's original drawings for the book.[10][11]

Philip Pullmanhas describedThe Magic Puddingas ""the funniest children's book ever written""[7]and as his favourite book.[12]

In 1960Peter Scrivenadapted the book as apuppet show, for which Lindsay produced 40 drawings. Scriven'sMarionette Theatre of Australiacontinued to perform the puppet show around Australia until 1988.[13]

An animated feature-length film adaption was released in 2000, withJohn Cleesevoicing the title role,Hugo Weavingas Bill,Geoffrey Rushas Bunyip, andSam Neillas Sam.  It deviated heavily from Lindsay's book, received mixed reviews from critics, and was not a financial success.[14]

In 2010, Marian Street Theatre for Young People, based in Killara, NSW, presented an adaption of Lindsay's script. Adapted by Andrew James, the production was the first to portray most of the characters in Lindsay's story using actors, rather than puppetry.[15]

In 2013,Victorian OperapresentedThe Magic Pudding – The Opera. The music is by Calvin Bowman and the libretto is adapted from Lindsay's book byAnna Goldsworthy.[16]

In 1985 apostage stampdepicting an illustration from the book, was issued byAustralia Postas part of a set of five commemorating children's books.[17]"

Flannery believes that the ""guinea"" is an indication of the pigs' national origin. He argues that they should bear the higher freight charge of 30¢ for livestock, rather than the lower 25¢ for domestic pets. In support of this, he submits that if they were ""dago pigs"" or ""Irish pigs,"" there would be no question of the animals' status.

Because the customer refuses to accept delivery, Flannery is forced to feed and house what he now calls the ""dago pigs"" in his office. When he eventually receives instructions to accept the lower price, he discovers that the customer has moved. He is then instructed by his superiors to return the pigs to the company warehouse. By this time, the guinea pigs have reproduced exponentially in Flannery's station house. After returning all the descendants, Flannery resolves to charge the lower rate for any future livestock.

The story was made into movie form several times, including theWalt Disneycartoon in 1954 that was nominated for anAcademy Award for Animated Short Film. The 1937Merrie MelodiescartoonPigs Is Pigs, directed byFriz Freleng, is not an adaptation of the Butler story.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7194,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Part 2.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer,"Orphan Tom Sawyer (around 12 to 13 years old) lives with hisAunt Pollyand his half-brother Sid in the town ofSt. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime in the 1840s. He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes himwhitewashher fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him smalltrinketsand treasures for the ""privilege"" of doing his work, usingreverse psychologyto convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in hisSunday schoolclass for tickets given out for memorizing verses ofScripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prizedBiblefrom the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.

Tom falls in love withBecky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get ""engaged"" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was ""engaged"" to another schoolgirl,Amy Lawrence.

Becky spurns Tom, who accompaniesHuckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform aritualintended to healwarts. At the graveyard, they witness threebody snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter andInjun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potterunconsciousand is thenmurderedby Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear ablood oathnot to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe's claim.

Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson's Island in theMississippi Riverto begin life as ""pirates"". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing andpresumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his ownfuneral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing atchurchin the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master'sanatomybook after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting thepunishmentthat would have been hers.

During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck andtestifiesfor the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees thecourtroombefore he can be apprehended; Potter isacquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives.

Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard ofgold coinswhile doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthyWidow Douglasso Injun Joe canmutilateher face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, ajustice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.

Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on apicnicto a localcavewith Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facingstarvationanddehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave's entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.

A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over$12,000(equivalent to $405,000 in 2024) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of acivilizedhome life painful, attempting to escape back to hisvagrantlife. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom's offer to form a high-classrobber gang.

The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later madeMark Twainone of the most important authors ofAmerican literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel's setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain's actual boyhood home ofHannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]

The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom's actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was,The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographsshows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]

Tom Sawyerwas Twain's first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress,Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These areThe Story of the Good BoyandThe Story of the Wicked Little Boywhich are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.

By the time he wroteTom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity ofThe Innocents Abroad.He owned a large house inHartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel withCharles Dudley Warner,The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]

He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.

Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]

In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of theAmerican Publishing Company, who sent it toTrue Williamsfor the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published atChatto and Windusof London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]

Athird personnarrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to afirst person narrative.[12]The two other subsequent books,Tom Sawyer AbroadandTom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.

The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet ""nigger""; abowdlerizedversion aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]

The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal ofNative Americansthrough the characterInjun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction.Carter Revardsuggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]

Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels:Huck and Tom Among the IndiansandTom Sawyer's Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain's unfinishedSchoolhouse Hill.

Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Actspremiered on October 14, 2011, at theKauffman Center for the Performing ArtsinKansas City, Missouri. The score was by composerMaury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of theKansas City Ballet.[36][37]A review inThe New York Timesobserved: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.""[38]

The Adventures of Tom Sawyerhas been adapted intocomic bookform many times:

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2042,Something New,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Fresh,"Ashe Marson and his fellow lodger Joan Valentine discover that they both work as writers for theMammoth Publishing Company. Joan urges Ashe to overcome his discontentment and take a fresh direction in life.

Meanwhile, Freddie Threepwood, younger son of the Earl of Emsworth, is engaged to marry Aline Peters, the daughter of American millionaire J. Preston Peters. Freddie pays a visit to a shady fixer, R. Jones, hoping to recover letters he once sent to a certain chorus girl, feeling they might be used to make abreach of promisecase against him. His father later calls on Aline's father to view his collection ofscarabsand absent-mindedly puts Mr Peters' prize exhibit in his pocket. Though Peters suspects the Earl, he cannot confront him for fear of endangering his daughter's marriage.

Aline is being pursued by George Emerson, a Hong Kong police officer, who wishes to marry her. Having befriended Freddie Threepwood, George has been invited to Blandings Castle, the family home, at the same time that Aline and her father are paying a visit. R. Jones finds the address of Freddie's ex-sweetheart, Joan Valentine, who tells him she has long since destroyed any letters she may have had from Freddie. As Jones is leaving, Aline, a former school friend of Joan, arrives on a visit, and the suspicious Jones listens at the door. Hearing that Aline's father is offering £1,000 to anybody who can retrieve his scarab, Joan decides that she will go herself to Blandings, posing as Aline's maid, so as to recover the scarab and scoop the reward. Acting separately, Ashe answers a newspaper advert and is engaged as his valet by Mr. Peters, who is looking for somebody to steal back the scarab during his visit to Blandings.

Ashe informs Joan about this as they both take the train from London. During the trip Joan warns Ashe of the complicated system of etiquette observed among servants of a large house. She hopes this will persuade him to give up his quest and remove himself as her competitor. After their arrival, Ashe is terrified to be interviewed by the butler, Beach, and has to listen to a recital of his troubles with his feet and his stomach. Mr Peters also has stomach trouble and Ashe threatens him with non-cooperation unless he takes some exercise and stops smoking cigars.

At night, Ashe and Joan are both trying to get at the scarab when Lord Emsworth's watchful secretary,Rupert Baxter, nearly catches them. Next morning, Ashe and Joan decide to become allies and, after flipping a coin, agree to take turns at stealing the scarab. Since Aline is following the same reduced diet as her father, George steals downstairs to prepare her a midnight feast and collides with Ashe in the dark hall. They start a noisy fight but escape after the suspicious Baxter trips over them and is found surrounded by food and broken china by the time the lights are turned on. He is blamed for waking everyone and roundly criticised by Lord Emsworth for going in search of food in the middle of the night.

The next night is Joan's turn to make her attempt, but she finds the scarab has already gone. Putting together clues, she and Ashe discover that Freddie needs money to pay R. Jones, who is pretending that Joan is demanding it for the return of his letters. But Freddie is an admirer of the detective tales that Ashe writes and decides to trust him, confessing to the theft and returning the scarab. As Ashe leaves, Lord Emsworth arrives to announce that Aline has eloped on the train to London with George Emerson, who has been recalled to Hong Kong. Freddie is more relieved than hurt at this revelation.

When Ashe returns the scarab, Mr Peters offers to take Ashe back to America as his personal trainer in reward for the improvement in his health. Ashe hesitates long enough to ask Joan to marry him, and she admits she has been grieving at what seems to be the end of their partnership; as a result, a scullery maid looking out of the window has her dull life enriched as she sees them kissing.

As a young boy inVictorianEngland, Wodehouse was taken on social calls with his aunts to great houses and often had tea in the Servants' Hall, where he learned about the servants' hierarchy and etiquette. These observations were incorporated intoSomething Fresh.[3]Before Wodehouse wrote the novel, his uncle Walter Meredith Deane and later his eldest brother Philip Peveril had served as second-in-command of the Hong Kong police force, like George Emerson in the novel.[4]

Wodehouse converted pounds sterling into dollars in the story for the American readers ofThe Saturday Evening Postwhen it was first serialised between 26 June and 14 August 1915.[5]The title ""Something New"" was used in America instead of ""Something Fresh"" because ""fresh"" has a meaning synonymous with ""impertinent"" in America.[6]For it Wodehouse received a fee of $3,500, more than for any previous work.[7]The serial inThe Saturday Evening Postincluded illustrations by F. R. Gruger.[8]

The book is described, in a new preface added in 1969, as the start of ""the Blandings Castle Saga"".[9]Into this scenario many new elements were to be introduced over the years, but there was also one notable omission. This was Lord Emsworth's sister Lady Ann Warblington, who is mentioned inSomething Freshas subject to headaches and largely confined to her room, never to reappear in a Blandings novel again.[7]

Something Freshwas published in the 1979 collection of Blandings novelsLife at Blandings, along withSummer LightningandHeavy Weather.[10]

The story was adapted in 2009 by Archie Scottney as aradio dramafor BBC Radio 4'sClassic Serialseries. The cast includedIan Ogilvyas the narrator (credited as playing the role of ""Wodehouse""),Ioan Gruffuddas Ashe Marson,Helen McCroryas Joan Valentine,Martin Jarvisas Lord Emsworth,Hector Elizondoas J. Preston Peters,Andrea Bowenas Aline Peters, andJames Frainas George Emerson.[11][12]"

The second part describes his travels through Switzerland and eastern France (Lucerne,Interlaken,Zermatt,ChamonixandGeneva). The end of the book covers his trip through  several cities in northern Italy (Milan,VeniceandRome). Several other cities are touched and described during their travels, as well as mountains such asMatterhorn, theJungfrau, theRigi-KulmandMont-Blanc.

Interleaved with the narration, Mark Twain inserted stories not related to the trip, such asBluejay Yarn,The Man who put up at Gadsby'sand others; as well as many German Legends, some invented by the author himself.[2]

Six appendices are included in the book. They are short essays dedicated to different topics. The role ofThe Portierin European hotels and how they make their living, a description ofHeidelberg Castle, an essay on College Prisons in Germany, ""The Awful German Language"", a humorous essay on German language, a short story called ""The Legend of the Castle"" and a satirical description of German newspapers.

The book contains ca. 328[3]illustrations, which contribute to the humor in the book, mainly done by artistsWalter Francis Brown,True W. Williams,Benjamin Henry DayandWilliam Wallace Denslow.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423,Mike,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_(novel),"Mike is leaving his private school to go to Wrykyn. His sisters hope that he will get into the school team his first year, although his brotherBoband Saunders, the pro, are sceptical. On the train down to Wrykyn, Mike is joined by a stranger; seeing the boy get off the train without his bag, Mike throws it out onto the platform, but the boy returns at the next stop. It turns out that the stranger isFirby-Smith, head ofWain's house, which Mike is to join.

Mike meets and befriends Wyatt, Wain's stepson. Wyatt asksBurgess, the cricket captain, to allow Mike to try out; Mike performs well and gets on the third team.

Mike is later allowed to play for the first after Wyatt is involved in a fight between some of the students and a gang from Wrykyn town, which ends up with a policeman being thrown into a pond. The policeman exaggerates the incident to the headmaster, claiming several hundred boys had thrown him into the water, and the headmaster punishes the school by cancelling a forthcoming holiday. In retaliation, Wyatt organises a mass walk-out, taking most of the school with him to a nearby town. As punishment for this, the younger boys arecaned, and the older boys are all given ""extra"" during a cricket match against theM.C.C.As there are now several openings in the team, Wyatt persuades Burgess to let Mike play.

Mike plays well in the M.C.C. match, scoring 23 not out, against a team that includes both Mike's brother Joe and the pro Saunders. However, in a later house match, Firby-Smith runs Mike out, and Mike insults him. Firby-Smith insists that Mike be punished, but Bob persuades him not to. In gratitude, Mike, finding that he has squeezed Bob out of the team, feigns a sprained wrist so that Bob will get into the team instead of him.

Soon after, a boy brings the chicken-pox to the school. The outbreak takes out one of the first-team players, giving Mike another chance; he plays reasonably in a poor game. Bob tells him he thinks the first-team place is now Mike's, but next day Mike again angers Firby-Smith by missing early morning fielding practice for the house. When Burgess hears Firby-Smith's story, he decides to pass Mike over in favour of Bob.

Neville-Smith, a bowler who has taken the other place in the team, plans a party at his house (he is a day boy) in celebration of his placement, and Wyatt sneaks out of school to attend. On his way out he is spotted by a master, who reports it to Wain; the housemaster waits in Mike's room until Wyatt returns, and tells him he is to leave the school at once, to take a job in a bank. Mike takes Wyatt's place in the team, and persuades his father to find Wyatt more interesting work, via his connections inArgentina.

Wrykyn go into the match against their biggest rivals, Ripton, short on bowling but with both Jacksons. The wicket is sticky from rain and Ripton notch up a good score, and taking the field reveal they having a strong bowler ofgooglies. After a bad start, Wrykyn's fortunes look up when the brothers bat together. Bob gets out, but has given Mike time to settle in; with the tail of the team accompanying him, he deftly collars the bowling, finishing on 83 not out; Wrykyn wins.

Mike has been at Wrykyn for another two years and is due to become cricket captain next term, but during the Easter holidays, his father, receiving Mike's poor performance report, removes him from Wrykyn and sends him instead toSedleigh, a far smaller school.

Arriving at Sedleigh in a bitter mood, he meetsMr Outwood, the head of his house. Mike then meets a well-dressed boy with amonocle, who introduces himself asPsmith. The P in his surname is silent and was added by himself, in order to distinguish him from other Smiths. He is an ex-Etonianwhose family lives near Mike's, and, like Mike, is a new boy. They decide to avoid cricket and instead join Mr Outwood'sarchaeologicalsociety.

Having made friends with a boy calledJellicoe, the three take a dormitory together. The next day, they meetAdair, school cricket captain, and house-masterMr Downing, both of whom are disappointed by the new boys' refusal to play cricket. Both Psmith and Mike claim ignorance of cricket, a decision which Mike comes to regret.

Bored by their archaeology trips, they wander off one day, and Mike runs into an old cricketing friend, who offers him a place in a local village team. Mike enjoys the games, but keeps his village cricket career a secret. Mike eventually reveals his cricketing history, and is persuaded to play in an upcoming house match as revenge against Mr Downing, who unfairly favours his own house. The game ends with Mike making 277 not out, and Downing's not getting an innings at all.

Mike agrees to deliver money to a pub owner in Wrykyn town for his roommate, Jellicoe. After discovering that the money was not owed, he returns to Wrykyn, attempts to return to his house, and is chased by Downing. He rings the school fire bell and escapes in the confusion.

The next morning, Sammy, Mr. Downing's dog, turns up covered in red paint. Downing is enraged and proceeds to investigate: he finds that a boy from Outwood's was seen abroad that night, and finds spilled red paint in the bike shed with a footprint in it. He gets Psmith to show him round Outwood's house, searching for boots with red paint on them, and he finds one of Mike's with paint on it. Psmith successfully hides the boot, but does not tell Mike, so Mike ends up wearing shoes to school, attracting Downing's attention.

Meanwhile, Stone and Robinson, not pleased with Adair's proposal to hold an early-morning cricket practice, decide they can safely skip it. Adair has other ideas, and fights Stone, bullying them both into playing. He then visits Mike and invites him to either play or fight. Despite being the betterboxer, Adair loses his temper, and loses the fight. Psmith persuades Mike to play, telling him that he also will be playing, revealing that he had been a very good bowler at Eton. Adair sprained a wrist during the fight and is unable to play; the match is rained out. Downing tells the headmaster that he suspects Mike of painting Sammy, but it is found out that it had been done by Dunster, an old student. Mike and Adair arrange a match between Sedleigh and Wrykyn, and Sedleigh wins.

Both Mike and Psmith feature in several later novels by Wodehouse:

Wrykyn school had previously appeared in two novels:

Several short stories are also set at Wrykyn, some of which are listed atList of short stories by P. G. Wodehouse#School stories.

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909,Nightmare Abbey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_Abbey,"Insofar as the novel may be said to have a plot, it follows the fortunes of Christopher Glowry, a morose widower who lives with his only son Scythrop in the isolated family mansion, Nightmare Abbey, inLincolnshire. Mr Glowry's melancholy leads him to choose servants with long faces or dismal names such as Mattocks, Graves and Skellet. The few visitors he welcomes to his home are mostly of a similar cast of mind, with the sole exception of his brother-in-law, Mr Hilary. The visitors engage in conversations, or occasionally monologues, which serve to highlight their eccentricities or obsessions.

Mr Glowry's son Scythrop is recovering from a love affair which ended badly. A failed author, he often retires to his own quarters in a tower to study. When he leaves them, he is distracted by the flirtatious Marionetta, who blows hot and cold on his affections. A further complication arises when Celinda Toobad, fleeing from a forced engagement to an unknown suitor, appeals to Scythrop for shelter and he hides her in a secret room. The change in Scythrop's demeanour spurs on Marionetta to threaten to leave him forever, and he is forced to admit to himself that he is in love with both women and cannot choose between them.

There is a brief interruption to the usual round of life at the Abbey when the misanthropic poet, Mr Cypress, pays a farewell visit before going into exile. After his departure, there are reports of a ghost stalking the building, and the appearance of a ghastly figure in the library throws the guests into consternation. Only later is the apparition revealed to have been Mr Glowry's somnambulant steward Crow.

Scythrop's secret comes out when Mr Glowry confronts his son in his tower and asks what are his intentions towards Marionetta, ""whom you profess to love"". Hearing this, Miss Toobad (who has been passing herself off under the name of Stella) comes out of the hidden chamber and demands an explanation. During the ensuing row, Mr Toobad recognises his runaway daughter, whom he had really intended for Scythrop all along. But both women now renounce Scythrop and leave the Abbey, determined never to set eyes on him again.

After all the guests depart, Scythrop proposes suicide and asks his servant Raven to bring him ""a pint of port and a pistol"". He is only dissuaded when his father promises to leave for London and intercede for his forgiveness with one or other of the women. When Mr Glowry returns, it is with letters from Celinda and Marionetta, who announce their forthcoming marriage to two of the other guests instead. Scythrop is left to console himself with the thought that his recent experiences qualify him ""to take a very advanced degree in misanthropy"" so that he may yet hope to make a figure in the world.

Many of the characters who figure in the novel are based on real people. The names they are given by Peacock express their personality or governing interest."

After adelirium tremenscrisis in which Pap tries to kill Huck, Huck fakes his own murder and settles on Jackson's Island, where he reunites with Miss Watson's slaveJim, who ran away after overhearing she was planning to sell him. Huck and Jim decide to go down theMississippi RivertoCairo, in thefree stateofIllinois. After a flood, they find atimber raftand a house floating downstream. Inside the house, Jim finds a man who was shot to death but prevents Huck from seeing.[5]Huck sneaks into town and discovers there is a reward for Jim's capture and he is suspected of killing Huck; they flee on their raft.

Huck and Jim come across a groundedsteamboaton which two thieves discuss murdering a third. Finding their raft has drifted away, they flee in the thieves' boat. They find their raft and sink the thieves' boat, then Huck tricks a night watchman into a rescue attempt, which fails when the steamboat sinks. Huck and Jim are separated in afog. When they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the event. Jim is disappointed in Huck when Huck admits the truth. Huck is surprised by Jim's strong feelings and apologizes.

Huck is conflicted about supporting a runaway slave, but when two white men seeking runaways come upon the raft, his lies convince them to leave. Jim and Huck realize they have passed Cairo. With no way to go upriver, they decide to continue downriver. The raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating them. On the riverbank, Huck meets the Grangerfords, who are engaged in a 30-year feud with the Shepherdsons. After a Grangerford daughterelopeswith a Shepherdson boy, all of the Grangerford men are killed in a Shepherdson ambush. Huck escapes and is reunited with Jim, who has recovered and repaired the raft.

Jim and Huck are joined by twoconfidence menclaiming to bea King and a Duke, and they rope Huck and Jim into aiding in several scams. In one town, the King and the Duke cheat the townsfolk over two nights with a short, overpriced stage performance. On the third, the grifters collect the admission fee from previous audience members bent on revenge, then flee the town. In the next town, the swindlers impersonate the brothers of the recently deceased Peter Wilks and attempt to steal his estate. Huck tries to retrieve the money for Wilks's orphaned nieces. Two other men claiming to be Wilks' brothers arrive, causing an uproar. Huck flees but is caught by the King and the Duke. He escapes but finds they sold Jim to thePhelpses. Huck vows to free Jim, despite believing he will go to hell for it.

The Phelpses mistake Huck for their nephew Tom, who is expected for a visit, and Huck plays along. Their nephew is Tom Sawyer, and when he arrives he pretends to be his brotherSid, and develops a theatrical plan to free Jim. Huck attempts to warn the King and the Duke that Jim alerted the local residents to their scam but sees themtarred and featheredand beingrun out of town on a rail.

Tom is wounded during Jim's escape. Instead of fleeing, Jim stays to tend to him and is arrested and returned to the Phelpses.[6]Tom'sAunt Pollyarrives and reveals Huck's and Tom's true identities. She explains that Miss Watson has died, and that she freed Jim in her will. Tom admits he knew but wanted to ""rescue"" Jim in style.[7]Jim tells Huck Pap was the dead man in the floating house. Huck declares he will flee toIndian Territoryto escape adoption by the Phelpses."

Licht also notices a large gash on Adam's face. Adam tells Licht that he received these wounds when he fell down after getting out of bed this morning and hit his head on the fireplace. Licht also comments on Adam'sclubfoot.

Licht informs Adam that Walter, a government inspector who travels through the country to inspect the finances and the proceedings of the town courts, will arrive this day to take a look at Adam's court. Licht also tells Adam that a judge in a neighboring town has tried to commit suicide after Walter found problems at the court. Additionally, today is court day, and no one can find Adam'swig, with Adam's maidservant insisting that Adam arrived home without the wig late last evening.

When Walter arrives, he insists that Adam immediately start the day's trial. The parties are the plaintiff Marthe, a widowed farmer who is there with her daughter Eve and the defendant, Ruprecht, Eve's fiancé together with his father, Veit. Before the trial Eve tries to speak to Ruprecht, who rejects her and calls her a harlot. Adam also speaks to the parties before the trial, especially Eve, seemingly trying to influence her testimony. Walter admonishes Adam and requests him to start the official trial immediately.

When the trial starts, an enraged Marthe accuses Ruprecht of having destroyed a water jug which was intricately painted and had rich family history and because of that had a large emotional value to her. Other people suggest that her disappointment of Ruprecht's treatment of Eve may also have something to do with her anger. Marthe claims that she found Ruprecht in Eve's room last night with the door broken down and the jug broken. She also claims that Eve had accused Ruprecht of breaking the jug.

When it is Ruprecht's turn to testify, he explains that he secretly went to Eve's home and heard her talk with somebody in her room. He mentions that he suspected it to be a man called Lebrecht, who had previously shown interest in Eve. When Adam hears that Lebrecht is suspected, he eagerly requests that information to be noted in the protocol. Ruprecht says that he broke down the door, entered the room and saw someone flee through the window. He was able to hit the fleeing man twice over the head with a broken off door handle but could not identify the person. He also admits that he is not absolutely sure if it was him or the fleeing man who broke the jug in the chaos.

When it is Eve's turn, Adam again talks to her, seemingly trying to influence her testimony. Walter again admonishes him. Eve testifies that it was not Ruprecht who broke the jug but that she will not name the actual guilty person.

During a pause in the proceedings, Adam tries to get Walter drunk. Then, Brigitte, a lodger in Marthe's house arrives with Licht and a wig in her hand. She states that she found the wig last night in Marthe's garden and that she and Licht found a club-footed trail in the fresh snow and both followed that trail to Adam's house.

Walter asks Adam to come clean but Adam refuses and instead hands down his ruling: Ruprecht is convicted and shall go to jail for his insubordination against the court. Eve now exclaims that it was Adam who was in her room last night and who broke the jug while fleeing. An enraged Ruprecht attacks Adam, who flees the court room unharmed. Walter ensures Ruprecht that his conviction will be overturned, Ruprecht and Eve reconcile and their parents approve of their wedding.

In 1937 a Germanfilm of the same titlewas released withEmil Janningsin the lead. It is also a 1941 opera byViktor Ullmann. In 1944 it was produced as a film in Mexico by the German directorAlfredo B. Crevennaunder the titleAdam, Eve and the Devil.[4]

The action is given as occurring 1827–28, though critics have noted some seeming anachronisms.[7]For example, Dickens satirized thecaseofGeorge NortonsuingLord Melbournein 1836.[8]

The novel's protagonistSamuel Pickwick, Esquire is a kind and wealthy old gentleman, the founder and perpetual president of the Pickwick Club. He suggests that he and three other ""Pickwickians"" should make journeys to places remote from London and report on their findings to the other members of the club. Their travels throughout the English countryside by coach provide the chief subject matter of the novel.[9]A romantic misunderstanding with hislandlady, the widowMrs Bardell, results in one of the most famous legal cases in English literature,Bardell v. Pickwick,[10][11]leading to them both being incarcerated in theFleet Prisonfor debt.[12]

Pickwick learns that the only way he can relieve the suffering of Mrs Bardell is by paying her costs in the action against himself, thus at the same time releasing himself from the prison.[7][13]

Pickwick, Sam Weller, and his father Tony briefly reappeared in 1840 in the magazineMaster Humphrey's Clock. Master Humphrey's Clock is the name of a literary club founded by Mr Humphrey, whose members read out stories to the others.[14]Pickwick is a member, and there is a mirror club in the kitchen, Mr. Weller's Watch, run by Sam Weller.

See Mr. Pickwick inMaster Humphrey's Clock[14]

The novel has been adapted to film, television, and radio:

In 1985 BBC released a12-part 350-minute miniseriesstarringNigel Stock,Alan Parnaby,Clive SwiftandPatrick Malahide.[17]

In 1977,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Barry Campbell andConstance CoxwithFreddie Jonesas Mr. Pickwick.[18]In 1997,BBC Radio 4released a dramatization by Martyn Read withClive Francisas Mr. Pickwick.[19]

There was an early attempt at a theatrical adaptation with songs byW. T. Moncrieffand entitledSamuel Weller, or, The Pickwickians, in 1837. This was followed in 1871 byJohn Hollingshead's stage playBardell versus Pickwick. The first successful musical wasPickwick(sometimesPickwick, A Dramatic Cantata) bySir Francis BurnandandEdward Solomonand premiered at the Comedy Theatre on 7 February 1889.[20]

PickwickbyCyril Ornadel,Wolf Mankowitz, andLeslie Bricussewas a musical version which premiered inManchesterin 1963 before transferring to theWest End. It originally starredHarry Secombe(later cast as ""Mr. Bumble"" in the film version ofOliver!) in the title role andRoy Castleas ""Sam Weller"". Although it was a major success in London, running for 694 performances,Pickwickfailed in the United States when it opened onBroadwayin 1965. In 1969, theBBCfilmed the musical as the TV moviePickwickwith Secombe and Castle reprising their stage roles. Both the stage and TV versions featured the songIf I Ruled the World, which became a hit for Secombe and other singers such asTony BennettandSammy Davis Jr.

Part ofThe Pickwick Paperswere featured inCharles Dickens' Ghost Stories, a 60-minute animation made by Emerald City Films (1987). These includedThe Ghost in the Wardrobe,The Mail Coach Ghosts, andThe Goblin and the Gravedigger.

Stephen Jarvis's novelDeath and Mr Pickwick[21](2014) is in part a literary thriller, examining in forensic detail the question of whether the idea, character and physiognomy of Samuel Pickwick originated with Dickens, or with the original illustrator and instigator of the project, Robert Seymour. The conclusion of the narrator is that the accepted version of events given by Dickens and the publisherEdward Chapmanis untrue.

The novel was published in 19 issues over 20 months; the last was double-length and cost twoshillings. In mourning for his sister-in-lawMary Hogarth, Dickens missed a deadline and consequently, there was no number issued in May 1837. Numbers were typically issued on the last day of its given month:

Dickens drew on places that he knew from his childhood. He located the duel between Mr. Winkle and Dr. Slammer atFort Pitt, Chatham,[22]close to Ordnance Terrace where he had lived as a boy between 1817 and 1821.[23]

The popularity ofThe Pickwick Papersspawned many imitations and sequels in print, as well as actual clubs and societies inspired by the club in the novel. One example still in operation is the Pickwick Bicycle Club of London, established in 1870, the year of Charles Dickens's death.[24]The Dickens Pickwick Club was founded in 1976 byCedric Dickens, the author's great-grandson. Other clubs, groups, and societies operating under the name ""The Pickwick Club"" have existed since the original publication of the story.

In 1837, Dickens wrote to William Howison about the Edinburgh Pickwick Club. Dickens approved of the use of the name and the celebration of the characters and spirit of the novel. He wrote:

Other clubs include one meeting as early as December 1836 in the East of London and another meeting at the Sun Tavern inLong Acrein London. Dickens wrote to the secretary of the latter club in 1838 about attending a meeting:

In many Pickwick Clubs, members can take on the names of the characters in the novel. The website for the Pickwick Bicycle Club states: ""Our rules state that 'Each Member shall adopt the sobriquet allocated by the Management Committee, being the name of some male character in the Pickwick Papers, and be addressed as such at all meetings of the Club'.""[27]

A French translation byEugénie Niboyetappeared in 1838 in a two-volume edition. It was entitledLe Club des Pickwistes, roman comique. Later French translations have used titles such asAventures de Monsieur Pickwick.

Benito Pérez GaldóspublishedAventuras de Pickwick, a Spanish translation of thePickwick Papers, in 1868. Although Pérez Galdós was not born until after the publication of Dickens' first novel, he is sometimes described as the Spanish equivalent of Dickens.[28]

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/179,The Europeans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Europeans,"Eugenia and her brother Felix arrive in Boston. The next day Felix visits their cousins. He first meets Gertrude, who is shirking attendance at church and reading romantic literature instead. He stays over for dinner. The next day Eugenia visits them. Three days later their uncle Mr Wentworth suggests they stay in a little house close to theirs. Felix suggests making a portrait of his uncle. When Mr. Wentworth refuses, he makes plans to do a painting of Gertrude instead. One day, Gertrude, out walking, encounters a young clergyman, Mr Brand who has been waiting for her. He renews his declaration of love, but Gertrude does not wish to hear it, and asks him to go away, weeping afterwards out of frustration (for her family is pushing her to accept Mr. Brand). She then sits for Felix who is doing her portrait. During their conversation he wonders why his American relatives seem so little concerned for the pleasures of life, living by strict standards, seeming not to think of their own individual happiness.

Eugenia notices the one eligible and wealthy bachelor, Robert Acton, cousin to the Wentworths, and they begin spending time together. Eugenia refers little to her marriage other than telling Mr. Acton she has a paper the husband's family wishes her to sign (which would dissolve the marriage.) She pays a visit to Mrs Acton and during their conversation tells a white lie – that her son has been talking about her a lot – which comes across as a faux-pas. In particular, Robert Acton notes the lie. Mr Wentworth tells Felix that his young son Clifford got suspended from Harvard University owing to his drinking problem. Felix suggests that the influence of a cultivated older woman might help him to improve his manners—a woman such as his sister, and indeed, the young Clifford begins visiting Eugenia.

Meanwhile, Felix and Gertrude are falling in love. Eventually, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry the minister Mr Brand, though she does not love him. Felix has noticed how Gertrude's sister Charlotte seems attracted to Mr. Brand, and is convinced she is in love with him. He speaks to Mr. Brand, implying as much. He and Gertrude would like to see Mr. Brand and Charlotte get together, as it would leave him and Gertrude free to pursue their own love affair.

One evening, Robert Acton, who has been away a few days (and is beginning to believe he is in love with Eugenia) goes late to visit her. In fact, Clifford was with Eugenia at the time, but when she realized Robert was coming she had Clifford hide in a back room. During her conversation with Mr. Acton, the subject of her marriage comes up again, and he also proposes they go together—alone—to seeNiagara Falls. Clifford comes unexpectedly out of his hiding place and there is a very awkward moment. Clifford leaves and Eugenia makes up an untrue story about the young man being at her home. Later, in talking with Clifford, Mr. Acton realizes she had not told the truth. The fact that she can lie begins to weigh upon his thoughts, and he ceases for several days to go visit her.

Meanwhile, Felix tells his sister Eugenia he wants to marry Gertrude; she lies also to her brother in claiming Robert Acton asked her to marry him but that she is not sure she wants to. She has understood that her goal of finding a wealthy man in the United States has failed but she has her pride. She decides to go back to Germany. She makes a farewell visit to Mrs Acton, sees Robert as she is leaving and claims to have sent the annulment papers to Germany (this also will turn out to be untrue). Mr. Acton expresses regret that she has decided to leave—but he makes no definitive proposition to her to keep her there.

Felix makes a visit to his uncle and asks for Gertrude's hand. His uncle is shocked at first, but his other daughter, Charlotte, speaks in favor of the match, then Gertrude comes in and declares she will marry Felix, and finally Mr. Brand comes in to say he would like to marry the young couple. Felix has found his felicity in America—he and Gertrude will marry and then live and travel in Europe—she will see the world she has longed to see. Mr Brand and Charlotte will also later marry, far more suited to one another than Gertrude was for Mr. Brand. But the Baroness Eugenia Münster, unsuccessful in her designs of seeking her fortune in America, refuses even to stay for her brother's wedding. She packs up her things, and returns to Europe.

Eugenia says that her ""father used to tell [her]"" of GeneralGeorge Washington. Meanwhile, Gertrude imagines that Eugenia will be like the lithograph ofEmpress Josephinehung in the Wentworth's parlor.

One of the more important themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she never will marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.[1]

The difference between Europeans and New Englanders manifests itself in particular in the expression of feelings and emotions, which are very sensitive for the former: love is more important than money. Moreover, American people are more straitlaced, and they have closer links with tradition. The most important thing in life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting moral rules. Mr Wentworth is profoundly surprised and fascinated by Eugenia's marriage experience as is Robert Acton; in the Americans' eyes, Eugenia is a perplexing woman.[2]

The omniscient narrator uses a very fine and cultivated language, sometimes he prefers Latin diction; preferring to introduce very long, detailed descriptions of the setting and of the characters, from both a psychological and a physical point of view. In addition to the contributions of the narrator, dialogue helps the author to introduce his characters and to show their reactions to unfolding events. Critic Robert Gale credited James with a ""specifically well-delineated New England"" in the book, which he found ""charming"".[3]

F.R. Leavis, the influential English literary critic, had a high opinion of this brief work, claiming:

Others, most notably the author's brotherWilliam James, faulted the novel's ""slightness."" Henry James replied in a 14 November 1878 letter that he somewhat agreed with the criticism:

In another letter to his friendElizabeth Boott, James blamed the shortness of the novel on the fact that the editor of theAtlantic Monthly,William Dean Howells, required that it occupy only 100 pages in the magazine. James had also promised Howells his next story would have a happy ending with ""distinct matrimony"" after the magazine serializedThe American(1877), in which the lovers are separated in the end. According to James he ""did [hit] it off mechanically in the closing paragraphs. I was not at all weary of the tale in the end, but I had agreed to write it inone hundred Atlanticpages, and its abrupt ending came from outward pressure - not from internal failing.""[6]

James excluded the novel from theNew York Editionof his fiction (1907–09). Among others speculating on the reasons for this exclusion, critic Oscar Cargill commented that ""the intimate contemporary judgment and misfortune may have been a lingering decisive factor in James' mind.""[7]

It has also been suggested by one author that Felix's rootlessBohemianorigin, as well as his ""eternal gaiety"", were signifiers of his covert homosexuality.[8]"

Humor,https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3179,The American Claimant,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Claimant,"The American Claimantis a comedy of mistaken identities and multiple role switches. Its cast of characters include an American enamored of British hereditary aristocracy and a British earl entranced by American democracy.

Colonel Mulberry Sellers:An eccentric white-headed old man who becomes the rightful heir to the Earl of Rossmore after the death of his relative, Simon Lathers. According to his wife, Sellers is a ""scheming, generous, good-hearted, moonshiny, hopeful, no-account failure"" who is well beloved for his generosity and approachability. Although many of his eccentric money-making schemes are failures, he occasionally ""makes a strike,"" as he calls it, and makes quite a bit of money. One such strike is an exceedingly popular toy, ""Pigs in the Clover,"" which he invents and patents.

According to the tin signs by his door, Sellers is an attorney at law and claim agent, a materializer, a hypnotizer, and a mind-cure dabbler. He has also been named ""Perpetual Member of the Diplomatic Body representing the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the globe near the republican court of the United States of America.""

The explanatory note at the beginning of the novel indicates that Colonel Sellers is the same character as Eschol Sellers in the first edition of Twain's earlier novelGilded Age(1873) and Beriah Sellers in later editions. The note also identifies Colonel Sellers as the same character as Mulberry Sellers in John T. Raymond's dramatization ofGilded Age.

Washington Hawkins:The Congressional Delegate from Cherokee Strip in the far west, who partners with Colonel Sellers in several of his schemes. Hawkins is described as a ""stoutish, discouraged-looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old, but whose hair swore to a hundred."" At the beginning of the novel he has been living with his wife, Louise, and their children for the last fifteen years.

Sally (Gwendolen) Sellers:Daughter of Colonel Mulberry Sellers and Polly Sellers. She attends Rowena-Ivanhoe College, ""the selectest and most aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies"" in the US. Like her father, Sally is given to Romantic aspirations and delusions of grandeur. She happily takes the name Gwendolen after her father becomes the rightful heir of the Earl of Rossmore. However, the narrative describes Sally as having a ""double personality"": She is both Sally Sellers, who is ""practical and democratic,""  and Lady Gwendolen, who is ""romantic and aristocratic."" During the day she works hard designing and sewing dresses to help financially support her family, and in the evening she upholds the shadowy fantasy of the family's nobility. She falls in love with Howard Tracy (Viscount Berkeley) at first sight and later renounces her aspirations of aristocracy in order to be with him.

Berkeley Rossmore (Howard Tracy):The only son and heir of the Earl of Rossmore. According to the narrative, his full name is the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire(which the narrative tells us is pronounced ""K'koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly, of Chumly Castle, Warrikshr""). At the beginning of the novel, Berkeley announces his intention to go to America and ""change places"" with Simon Lathers, the man he considers the rightful heir. He wishes to ""retire...from a false existence, a false position, and begin [his] life over again, begin it right--begin it on the level of mere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by pure merit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are equal and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim, win or lose as just a man—that alone, and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it."" Shortly after his arrival to the United States, the hotel in which he is staying catches fire. During his escape, Berkeley snatches up the cowboy hat and distinctive clothes of a bank robber from the Cherokee Strip whom, coincidentally, Hawkins has been ineffectually tracking. When Berkeley is seen in this garb, Hawkins and Colonel Sellers believe that this cowboy-hatted man is the desperado; everyone else believes that he is an English cowboy. After the newspapers announce that Berkeley has died in the fire, he decides to renounce his former identity and calls himself Howard Tracy, determining to work for his living according to democratic principles."

Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: ""A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in africassee, or aragout.""[1]

Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay whichlampoonthe then-influentialWilliam Pettyand thesocial engineeringpopular among followers ofFrancis Bacon. These lampoons includeappealing to the authorityof ""a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London"" and ""the famousPsalmanazar, a native of the islandFormosa"" (who had already confessed to not being from Formosa in 1706).

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting byparalipsis:

George Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target inA Modest Proposalwas not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.[3]Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.[4]A memorable example of these sorts of schemes ""involved the idea of running the poor through ajoint-stock company"".[4]In response, Swift'sModest Proposalwas ""a burlesque of projects concerning the poor""[5]that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

Ian McBride argues that the point ofA Modest Proposalwas to ""find a suitably decisive means of dehumanizing the settlers who had failed so comprehensively to meet their social responsibilities.""[6]A Modest Proposalalso targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who ""regard people as commodities"".[7]In the piece, Swift adopts the ""technique of a political arithmetician""[8]to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy.Edmund Wilsonargues that statistically ""the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated toMarx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population"".[8]Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that ""springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake"".[9]

Author Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a ""trap""[10]to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, ""details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty"" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.[11]Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create ""two opposing points of view"" that ""alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.""[11]

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses ""the vocabulary of animal husbandry""[12]to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn ""people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound"".[12]

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetoricianQuintilian).[13]The contrast between the ""careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme"" and ""the ridiculousness of the proposal"" create a situation in which the reader has ""to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan"".[13]

Scholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wroteA Modest Proposal.

James William Johnson argues thatA Modest Proposalwas largely influenced and inspired byTertullian'sApology: a satirical attack against earlyRoman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.[14]Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the worksA Modest ProposalandApology.[15]In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that ""human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human"".[14]Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.[14]In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic ""justification by ownership"" over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the mistreatment of the poor in Ireland.[16]

It has also been argued thatA Modest Proposalwas, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essayThe Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Childrenby Swift's rivalDaniel Defoe.[17]

Bernard Mandeville'sModest Defence of Publick Stewsasked to introduce public and state-controlledbordellos. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and—while not being a completely satirical text—has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.[18][19]Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous forThe Fable of the Beesand deliberations on private vices and public benefits.

John Lockecommented: ""Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power,that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them: If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto"". (First Treatise, sec. 59).

Robert Phiddian's article ""Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal"" focuses on two aspects ofA Modest Proposal: the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that ""there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody"".[20]

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of ""Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet"", argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argued that an insufficient number of critics have taken the time to focus directly on mercantilism and theories of labour inGeorgian eraBritain. ""If one regards theModest Proposalsimply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact"".[21]

At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that ""people are the riches of the nation"", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.[22]Furthermore, ""in themercantilistview no child was too young to go into industry"". In those times, the ""somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity"".[20]

Louis A. Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to ""become a source of wealth to the nation"" or else they ""must turn to begging and thievery"".[23]This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, ""Swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism.""[24]

Landa presents Swift'sA Modest Proposalas a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that ""people are the riches of a nation"".[23]Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.[24]The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.[24]Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.[24]Landa argued that Swift was putting the onus ""on England of vitiating the working of natural economic law in Ireland"" by denying Irishmen ""the same natural rights common to the rest of mankind.""[24]

Swift's essay created a backlash within Georgian society after its publication. The work was aimed at the elite, and they responded in turn. Several prominent members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work.Lord Bathurst's letter (12 February 1729–30) intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:"
